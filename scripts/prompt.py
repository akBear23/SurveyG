TASK: Analyze the following citation path where each paper builds upon previous work.

CITATION PATH [NUMBER_OF_PAPERS] papers:
[PAPER_INFO]
[PREVIOUS_CONTEXT]

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
For this development path, provide:

- What are the key methodological shifts or innovations?
- How do methods evolve from foundational to recent work?

- What is the collective contribution to "[QUERY]"?

CONSTRAINTS:
- Be specific and cite paper numbers (e.g., "Paper 3 introduces...")
- Focus on connections and evolution, not just individual contributions
- Avoid generic statements; ground analysis in actual methods/results
- Total length: 400-600 words

Provide a scholarly yet concise analysis.

   - What common trends or complementary approaches exist?
   - How do groups relate or differ?

4. **Layer Significance** (1-2 sentences):
   - What is this layer's overall impact on "[QUERY]"?

CONSTRAINTS:
- Be specific about methods (algorithms, architectures, techniques)
- Groups should be distinct yet comprehensive (cover all papers)
- Cite paper numbers explicitly
- Length: 500-700 words

*Instruction:* You are a research analyst synthesizing a body of literature. Your task is to analyze the provided papers on the survey topic "[QUERY]".

First, cluster the papers into distinct subgroups based on a critical analysis of their contributions, methodologies, and thematic scope. Then, provide a structured summary that not only describes these groups but also critiques and compares the papers within and across them.

PAPER INFORMATION: 
[PAPER_INFO]
*Output your analysis in the following exact structure:*

1.  <think>
    Explain your reasoning for how you clustered papers into subgroups based on their methodologies, contributions, and thematic scope.
    </think>

2.  *For each subgroup:*
    *   *Subgroup name*: [Clear descriptive name]
    *   *Papers*: [List paper titles and years]
    *   *Analysis*: Provide 2-4 paragraphs covering:
        *   *Core methodologies and approaches*: Describe the common technical or methodological toolkit shared by these papers.
        *   *Thematic focus and key contributions*: Explain the specific problem or aspect of "[QUERY]" this group addresses and their main intellectual contributions to the field.
        *   *Critique and comparison*: Act as a critic. Compare the papers within the subgroup. How do they relate? Which one introduced a key innovation? What are the shared or individual limitations (e.g., scalability, assumptions, evaluative rigor)?

3.  *Overall Perspective* (3-6 sentences):
    Synthesize the intellectual trajectory of the research area. How have the subgroups evolved over time? How do they relate to or build upon one another? Identify the key transitions, paradigm shifts, or unresolved tensions between the methodological approaches.

# TASK: Create Literature Review Outline

REQUIREMENTS:
1. **Structure Philosophy**:
   - Follow a PEDAGOGICAL PROGRESSION: Foundations → Core Methods → Advanced Topics → Applications → Future
   - Must include: Introduction, Foundational Concepts, Conclusion sections
   - [MIN_MAIN_SECTIONS]-[MAX_MAIN_SECTIONS] main body sections
   - Each main section: [MIN_SUBSECTIONS]-[MAX_SUBSECTIONS] subsections
   - Balance CHRONOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT with THEMATIC DEPTH

2. **Content Principles**:
   - **Narrative Arc**: Tell a coherent story from foundational concepts through cutting-edge developments
   - **Contextual Grounding**: Start with prerequisite knowledge before diving into meta-learning specifics
   - **Methodological Depth**: Group related approaches together 
   - **Practical Relevance**: Include dedicated sections for applications and real-world impact
   - **Forward-Looking**: Address emerging trends, challenges, and ethical considerations
   - Show connections and evolution between works, not just list them

3. **Section Design Guidelines**:
   
   **Early Sections (Foundation Building)**:
   - Section 1: Motivation and scope
   - Section 2: Essential background/foundational concepts from prerequisite fields
   - Sections 3-4: Core paradigms and early breakthroughs
   
   **Middle Sections (Methodological Depth)**:
   - Organize by major methodological families
   - Within each family: progression from foundational to advanced techniques
   - Show cross-connections between families
   
   **Later Sections (Modern Developments & Impact)**:
   - Recent trends and cutting-edge innovations
   - Dedicated applications section showing real-world impact
   - Conclusion with theoretical gaps, practical challenges, ethical considerations

4. **Evidence Tracking**:
   - Link each section to supporting evidence from both taxonomies and development paths
   - Use layer numbers (1,2,3) for taxonomy-based sections
   - Use seed IDs for development-path-based sections
   - Key papers should be distributed across relevant sections

# OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON ONLY):
For each section, add the section and its subsections titles in a hierarchical manner in the same 'section_outline'
For each section, add a paragraph to the key 'section_focus' to indicate the main focus of that section
For each section, add an id (taken from the information layer number or the development seed ids) to the key 'proof_ids' to indicate the proof for each section, if proof is from the taxonomy of layer 1 put "layer_1", if the proof is from the paper community, put id of that community (example: community_0, community_1,...) if the proof is from the development direction, put the seed(s) paper id.
    
Return a JSON array where each element represents ONE section:

```json
  [
        "section_outline": "### 1. Introduction
    *   1.1. Background: Knowledge Graphs and Their Significance
    *   1.2. The Role of Knowledge Graph Embedding
    *   1.3. Scope and Organization of the Review",
        "section_focus": "This section introduces Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and the fundamental problem of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE). It highlights the importance of KGE for various AI tasks and outlines the scope and structure of the review.",
        "proof_ids": [layer_1, community_2]
      ], 
      ...
```

CRITICAL JSON REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks, no ```json```)
- Escape special characters properly
- Section titles should be numbered (1., 2., 3., etc.)
- Subsections numbered relative to parent (2.1., 2.2., etc.)
- Each section_focus should be 50-100 words
