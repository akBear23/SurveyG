INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The static nature of traditional knowledge graphs fundamentally limits their ability to capture the dynamic evolution of real-world facts, entities, and relations. Addressing this critical challenge, this comprehensive survey delves into Temporal Knowledge Graph Representation Learning (TKGRL), offering an unparalleled exploration of methods designed to model knowledge over time. We introduce a novel, fine-grained taxonomy, categorizing TKGRL approaches into ten distinct paradigms, including Transformation-based, Decomposition-based, Graph Neural Networks, Autoregression, and emerging Language Model methods. Beyond a detailed analysis of their strengths and weaknesses, we illuminate major trends, from expanding representation spaces to integrating advanced neural architectures. The paper further summarizes the latest developments in applications like temporal knowledge graph reasoning and question answering, while critically identifying crucial future research directions in Scalability, Interpretability, and the transformative potential of Large Language Model integration. This authoritative review serves as an indispensable resource, guiding researchers through the complex landscape of TKGRL and charting a course for its next generation of advancements.
