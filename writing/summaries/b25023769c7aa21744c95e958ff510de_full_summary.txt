INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Accurate and efficient trajectory similarity computation is fundamental for countless spatial applications, yet current deep learning methods are plagued by prohibitive preprocessing costs, limited generality, and incomplete trajectory embedding. We introduce **KGTS**, a novel framework that revolutionizes trajectory similarity learning by seamlessly integrating **knowledge graph grid embedding**, **prompt trajectory embedding**, and **unsupervised contrastive learning**.

KGTS first employs **GRot**, a customized RotatE model, to embed map grids, capturing intricate spatial relationships. A pioneering **attentive prompt mechanism** then guides a multi-faceted embedding module, leveraging a **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)** for structural context and a **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)** for point order, ensuring comprehensive trajectory representation. Crucially, KGTS eliminates the need for costly O(q^2l^2) supervised label generation through an innovative unsupervised contrastive learning paradigm, featuring novel positive sample generation strategies that significantly enhance model generality.

Validated on real-world datasets, KGTS demonstrates superior performance, drastically reducing computational burden and unlocking unprecedented generalization capabilities. This work offers a powerful, scalable, and generalizable solution, poised to transform large-scale trajectory analysis across diverse domains.

### KGTS: Contrastive Trajectory Similarity Learning over Prompt Knowledge Graph Embedding \cite{chen2024}

1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**
    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** Existing deep learning methods for trajectory similarity computation suffer from immature trajectory embedding, poor generality, and heavy preprocessing requirements for training.
    *   **Importance & Challenge:** Trajectory similarity is fundamental for numerous spatial applications (e.g., animal migration, transportation optimization, route retrieval). Traditional methods (DTW, EDR, Hausdorff) have high computational complexity, often O(l^2), making them impractical for long trajectories and large datasets. Deep learning methods, while more efficient, typically rely on supervised learning, necessitating costly O(q^2l^2) preprocessing to generate similarity labels for all trajectory pairs. Furthermore, supervised methods struggle with generality due to the inability of training datasets to exhaustively cover diverse trajectory patterns and relationships.

2.  **Related Work & Positioning**
    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** The work builds upon grid-based trajectory embedding and deep learning techniques for sequence modeling (seq2seq, GNNs). It incorporates prompt learning and unsupervised contrastive learning, which have shown success in other domains (NLP, computer vision).
    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**
        *   **Knowledge-based methods (LCSS, DTW, ERP, EDR):** High computational complexity, O(l^2), hindering scalability.
        *   **Learning-based methods (t2vec, T3S, GTS):**
            *   **Heavy Preprocessing:** Primarily rely on supervised learning, requiring pre-computation of similarity labels for all trajectory pairs, which is computationally expensive (O(q^2l^2)).
            *   **Poor Generality:** Training datasets cannot exhaustively contain all trajectory patterns, leading to models with limited generalization capabilities, especially when positive samples are not truly similar.
            *   **Incomplete Information Embedding:** Some methods do not adequately embed all three crucial aspects of a trajectory: location, structure, and point order.

3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**
    *   **Core Technical Method:** KGTS is a novel framework that combines knowledge graph grid embedding, prompt trajectory embedding, and unsupervised contrastive learning.
        *   **GRot Grid Embedding:** Employs a modified RotatE model (named GRot) to embed map grids. It treats the space as a graph where grids are nodes and direct connections (8-neighboring grids) are relations. The RotatE score function is customized to `dr(h,t) = ||h ◦ r - t ◦ r||` to ensure neighboring grids have similar embeddings, capturing spatial relationships.
        *   **Prompt Trajectory Embedding:** Addresses the gap between general grid embeddings and specific trajectory embedding objectives.
            *   **Attentive Prompt Concatenation:** A learnable prompt vector `U` is concatenated with the grid embedding `˜Φi` using attentive weights (`αi_1`, `αi_2`) to form `Pi = [αi_1U; αi_2˜Φi]`. This guides the trajectory embedding module to effectively incorporate grid information.
            *   **Trajectory Structure Embedding (GCN):** A Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is used to model the structural relationships between grids within trajectories. An adjacency matrix `A` is constructed where edges exist if two grids are directly connected in *any* trajectory in the dataset.
            *   **Point Order Embedding (GRU):** A Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) processes the sequence of GCN-embedded prompt grids to capture the temporal order of points in a trajectory, producing the final trajectory embedding `z`.
        *   **Unsupervised Contrastive Learning:** Trains the prompt trajectory embedding module without requiring pre-computed similarity labels.
            *   **InfoNCE Loss:** Utilizes the InfoNCE loss function to minimize distance between positive samples and maximize distance between negative samples.
            *   **Creative Positive Sample Generation:** Devises three novel strategies to generate diverse positive samples from original trajectories, enhancing model generality:
                *   **Whole Trajectory Strategy:** (Implied, likely minor perturbations or identical copies)
                *   **Partial Trajectory Strategy-End:** Generates positive samples by taking partial trajectories from the end.
                *   **Partial Trajectory Strategy-Mid:** Generates positive samples by taking partial trajectories from the middle.
            *   **Negative Samples:** Other trajectories within the same training batch are used as negative samples.
    *   **Novelty/Difference:**
        *   First to integrate knowledge graph embedding (GRot) for spatial grid relationships with prompt learning for trajectory embedding.
        *   Novel attentive prompt scheme to bridge grid-level and trajectory-level embeddings.
        *   Unsupervised training with creatively designed positive sample generation strategies, significantly reducing preprocessing burden and improving generality compared to supervised methods.
        *   Dedicated modules (GCN for structure, GRU for order) ensure comprehensive embedding of trajectory characteristics.

4.  **Key Technical Contributions**
    *   **Novel Framework (KGTS):** Proposes a comprehensive framework for trajectory similarity computation, integrating grid embedding, prompt trajectory embedding, and unsupervised training.
    *   **GRot Grid Embedding:** Introduces GRot, a modified RotatE model, for embedding map grids to capture spatial neighboring relations effectively.
    *   **Prompt Trajectory Embedding Module:** Designs a novel prompt-based module that effectively incorporates grid embeddings and uses GCN and GRU to grasp location, structure, and point order information.
    *   **Unsupervised Contrastive Learning with Novel Positive Sample Generation:** Implements an unsupervised training scheme with newly designed strategies for generating positive samples, addressing the limitations of costly preprocessing and poor generality in supervised methods.

5.  **Experimental Validation**
    *   **Experiments Conducted:** Extensive experiments were performed to evaluate the performance of KGTS against state-of-the-art methods. The primary task is trajectory similarity computation.
    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results:** While specific metrics (e.g., AUC, F1-score, accuracy for similarity ranking/retrieval) are not explicitly named in the abstract/introduction, the paper states that experiments "demonstrate the superior performance of KGTS over state-of-the-art methods." This implies comparisons on standard similarity evaluation metrics.
    *   **Datasets:** Validated on two real-world trajectory datasets.

6.  **Limitations & Scope**
    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The paper implicitly assumes that grid-based representation is suitable for trajectories, which might lose fine-grained point-level details. The effectiveness of the prompt design is tied to the quality of the initial grid embeddings. The specific details of the three positive sample generation strategies are not fully elaborated in the provided text, which could be a limitation for replication without further details.
    *   **Scope of Applicability:** Primarily focused on improving trajectory similarity computation for general spatial information applications. The method is designed for grid-based trajectory representations.

7.  **Technical Significance**
    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** KGTS significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by:
        *   **Reducing Preprocessing Burden:** Eliminates the need for costly, quadratic-complexity label generation through unsupervised contrastive learning.
        *   **Improving Generality:** Novel positive sample generation strategies enhance the model's ability to handle diverse trajectory relationships, leading to better generalization.
        *   **Enhanced Embedding Quality:** Integrates knowledge graph embedding for spatial context and a prompt-guided module for comprehensive trajectory feature extraction (location, structure, order).
    *   **Potential Impact:** This work provides a more efficient, accurate, and generalizable framework for trajectory similarity, potentially enabling broader applications in fields requiring large-scale trajectory analysis. It also paves the way for future research into unsupervised and prompt-based learning for spatial data.
