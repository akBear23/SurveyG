\section{Advanced KGE Architectures and Training Optimizations}
Moving beyond the foundational translational models, the field of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) has significantly advanced by exploring more sophisticated architectures and refining training methodologies. This evolution is driven by the persistent need to capture richer semantic and structural information, handle complex relation patterns, improve generalization to unseen data, and optimize the learning process for efficiency and robustness. While early models laid the groundwork by establishing the concept of embedding entities and relations in continuous vector spaces, their limitations in expressiveness, scalability, and ability to handle diverse relation types spurred the development of more powerful approaches. This section delves into three critical areas of this advancement: the application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for learning expressive entity and relation representations, the development of sophisticated negative sampling strategies and refined loss functions to optimize training, and the emergence of hybrid or generalized embedding frameworks that combine diverse strengths or leverage novel mathematical spaces. These innovations collectively push the boundaries of KGE, enabling models to tackle increasingly complex knowledge graph challenges and facilitate advanced reasoning tasks, moving towards more intelligent and adaptable knowledge representation systems.

\noindent\textbf{Taxonomy Summary:} This section primarily draws from "Group 3: Graph Neural Network-based Models with Focus on Extrapolation and Interpretability" for its core architectural innovations. It also incorporates advanced aspects of "Group 1: Translational Models and Geometric Extensions," specifically focusing on the exploration of non-Euclidean embedding spaces and sophisticated training optimizations (negative sampling and loss functions) that build upon or critically re-evaluate foundational principles. Elements from "Group 2: Temporal and Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding" and "Group 4: Generative AI and Multimodal Reasoning for Scientific Discovery" are integrated where they introduce advanced architectures or training optimizations relevant to the section's focus on pushing the boundaries of KGE. The development direction highlighted here moves towards models that are more expressive, robust, and capable of handling complex scenarios through architectural innovation and optimized learning, rather than merely extending basic translational mechanisms.

\subsection{Graph Neural Network-based Models for Representation Learning}
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for Knowledge Graph Embedding, offering a natural way to leverage the inherent graph structure and learn rich, context-aware representations for entities and relations. Unlike traditional KGE models that often treat entities and relations as isolated points or vectors, GNNs explicitly aggregate information from an entity's local neighborhood, allowing for the capture of multi-hop relational paths and complex structural patterns. This capability is particularly crucial for tasks requiring strong generalization and extrapolation abilities, as GNNs can learn functions that generate embeddings based on structural context, rather than relying on pre-defined, fixed embeddings for every entity and relation. This makes them highly adaptable to evolving knowledge graphs and unseen entities, a significant advantage over many foundational KGE models.

\subsubsection{Understanding and Enhancing Extrapolation through Semantic Evidences}
A significant contribution to GNN-based KGE is the work by \cite{li2021}, which addresses the critical question of *how* KGE models extrapolate to unseen data, a key challenge for real-world applications. The authors identify three levels of "Semantic Evidences" (SEs) at the relation, entity, and triple levels, which provide crucial semantic information for effective extrapolation. Building on this insight, they propose **SE-GNN (Semantic Evidence aware Graph Neural Network)**, a novel GNN-based model. SE-GNN explicitly models each level of SE through corresponding neighbor patterns and multi-layer aggregation, leading to more extrapolative knowledge representations. This approach allows the model to generalize patterns learned from observed triples to unseen ones by recognizing similar semantic structures. Experiments on benchmark datasets like FB15k-237 and WN18RR demonstrate SE-GNN's state-of-the-art performance and superior extrapolation ability, highlighting the power of GNNs in capturing semantic context for robust generalization. The explicit modeling of semantic evidences provides a more interpretable mechanism for understanding how GNNs achieve their strong performance in inductive settings.

Further building on this foundation, \cite{li2025} introduces **GNN-FTuckER**, a novel link prediction model that integrates the SE-GNN structural encoder with an improved TuckER model decoder. This hybrid architecture leverages the SE-GNN's ability to model global graph structure and capture rich semantic embeddings through its attention-weighted aggregation mechanism. By combining this powerful GNN encoder, which excels at learning context-aware representations, with a tensor decomposition-based decoder, GNN-FTuckER enhances the model's capacity to capture complex non-linear relationships and contextual information. This is particularly valuable in specialized knowledge graphs, such as the TeaPle dataset for identifying suitable populations for tea varieties, where intricate domain-specific patterns need to be learned. This demonstrates how GNNs, specifically SE-GNN, can serve as robust encoders for learning highly expressive representations that are then effectively utilized by other KGE components, forming powerful hybrid systems.

GNNs also extend to more challenging extrapolation scenarios, such as those involving temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs), where entities and relations evolve over time. \cite{chen2023} proposes a meta-learning based approach for knowledge extrapolation in TKGs, specifically addressing unseen entities and relations. Their method meta-trains a **GNN framework** to capture relative position and temporal sequence patterns, allowing the transfer of learned patterns to embed unseen components. This illustrates the adaptability of GNNs in dynamic environments, where they learn generalizable mechanisms for representation generation rather than fixed embeddings, thereby enabling robust extrapolation to emergent knowledge. This is a critical advancement as real-world knowledge is rarely static. Beyond traditional KGE tasks, GNNs are also being applied in scientific discovery, showcasing their versatility in learning complex, domain-specific representations. For instance, \cite{ghafarollahi2024} developed a novel GNN model for rapidly predicting atomic-scale physical properties in multi-principal element alloys. This GNN learns rich representations of alloy configurations, encoding chemical and configurational features as nodes and bond types as edges, to bypass expensive atomistic simulations. This showcases GNNs' capacity to learn complex, physics-aware representations for advanced scientific applications, demonstrating their utility far beyond typical knowledge graph completion.

\subsection{Optimizing the Training Process: Negative Sampling and Loss Functions}
Beyond architectural innovations, the efficacy of KGE models heavily relies on sophisticated training methodologies, particularly in how negative examples are constructed and how the learning objective is formulated. These optimizations are crucial for guiding the model to learn discriminative and robust embeddings, preventing trivial solutions, and ensuring the learned representations accurately reflect the underlying knowledge. The evolution of these techniques reflects a deeper understanding of the challenges in KGE training, such as false negatives, embedding ambiguity, and catastrophic forgetting in dynamic settings.

\subsubsection{Sophisticated Negative Sampling Strategies}
Negative sampling is a critical component of KGE training, as it provides counter-examples to positive facts, preventing the model from trivially assigning high scores to all triples. Early models often used uniform negative sampling, which could inadvertently introduce "false negatives" (valid triples mistakenly labeled as negative), thereby hindering learning. A foundational advancement to mitigate this was introduced by \cite{wang2014} with a **Bernoulli sampling strategy** for TransH. This method leveraged the mapping properties of relations (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-one) to reduce the likelihood of sampling false negatives. For relations that are predominantly one-to-many, corrupting the tail entity is preferred, while for many-to-one relations, corrupting the head is more effective. While applied to a foundational model, this innovation marked a crucial step towards context-aware negative sampling, recognizing that not all negative samples are equally informative or valid.

Building significantly on this concept, \cite{huang2020} proposed a more advanced **Local-Cognitive Negative Sampling** method for their RatE model, which operates in complex vector space. This strategy integrates two key components to generate highly informative negative samples: **type-constraint training** and **self-adversarial learning**. Type-constraint training leverages prior knowledge by sampling negative entities only from relation-specific domains and ranges, drastically reducing the chance of false negatives and focusing the model on plausible corruptions. Simultaneously, self-adversarial learning dynamically scores uniformly sampled negative triples based on the current model's difficulty, prioritizing "hard" negative examples that the model struggles to distinguish from positive ones. By using a dynamic coefficient to balance samples from these two sources, RatE's negative sampling mechanism becomes highly adaptive and informative. This explicit strategy is designed to alleviate embedding ambiguity caused by one-to-many relations, where multiple tail entities might be incorrectly mapped close to a single head-relation pair. The adaptive nature of RatE's negative sampling, combined with its relation-adaptive translation function, significantly enhances the model's expressive power and disambiguation capabilities, representing a substantial leap from earlier, simpler sampling methods.

\subsubsection{Refined Loss Functions}
The choice and design of the loss function are equally paramount, as they dictate how the model learns from both positive and negative examples and shapes the embedding space. While much KGE research focuses on designing intricate scoring functions, \cite{nayyeri2019} critically argues that for translation-based embeddings like TransE, the **loss function is as important as the score function**. Their theoretical investigations and empirical validations demonstrate that a proper selection of the loss function can significantly mitigate TransE's previously perceived limitations in encoding complex relation patterns (e.g., many-to-many, symmetric relations), even without altering the core scoring mechanism. They show that by allowing a non-zero margin or "region of truth" for positive triples, many limitations attributed to TransE's architecture can be resolved. This work underscored the importance of optimizing the learning objective itself, opening new avenues for improving KGE models through careful loss design and a deeper theoretical understanding of their capabilities. This re-evaluation of foundational models through the lens of advanced loss function theory highlights that even "basic" architectures can achieve greater expressiveness with refined optimization strategies.

In the context of dynamic knowledge graphs, training optimizations extend to preserving knowledge over time, a challenge known as catastrophic forgetting. \cite{liu2024} addresses continual KGE (CKGE) with their **Incremental Distillation (IncDE)** method. While IncDE is a broader continual learning framework, its novel **incremental distillation mechanism** serves as a sophisticated loss function optimization. This mechanism facilitates the seamless transfer of entity representations from previous learning layers to subsequent ones, effectively preserving old knowledge while learning new facts. By incorporating a hierarchical strategy for learning new triples based on graph structure and a two-stage training paradigm, IncDE demonstrates how refined loss functions, particularly those involving knowledge distillation, can be crucial for addressing complex challenges like catastrophic forgetting in evolving knowledge graphs. This represents a significant advancement in loss function design, moving beyond simple margin-based objectives to incorporate mechanisms for knowledge retention and transfer in dynamic learning environments.

\subsection{Hybrid and Generalized Embedding Frameworks}
The pursuit of more expressive and robust KGE models has also led to the development of hybrid architectures that combine different strengths, and generalized frameworks that explore novel mathematical spaces beyond conventional Euclidean vectors. These approaches aim to overcome the inherent limitations of single-paradigm models by integrating diverse modeling capabilities, leading to more powerful and versatile knowledge representation.

\subsubsection{Exploring Non-Euclidean Embedding Spaces}
A groundbreaking direction in generalized embedding frameworks is the exploration of non-Euclidean spaces, which offer richer geometric properties to capture complex relational patterns. A pioneering work in this area was \cite{ebisu2017}, which introduced **TorusE: Knowledge Graph Embedding on a Lie Group**. TorusE directly addressed a fundamental regularization problem in TransE: the practice of forcing embeddings onto a unit sphere, which can warp the embedding space and hinder the translation principle. TorusE proposed to embed entities and relations on a **compact Lie group**, specifically an **n-dimensional torus**, instead of a real or complex vector space. The inherent compactness of the torus naturally regularizes the embeddings, preventing divergence without the need for explicit regularization and its adverse effects. This seminal work demonstrated that the translation principle could be effectively defined on a Lie group, opening a new research direction for KGE by encouraging the exploration of other geometric spaces for knowledge representation, such as hyperbolic spaces. While TorusE itself is a translation-based model, its innovation lies in the *space* it operates within, fundamentally altering the geometric properties of the embeddings and paving the way for more advanced non-Euclidean KGE models that leverage the unique characteristics of such spaces to model hierarchies, complex dependencies, or specific relational patterns more effectively than Euclidean counterparts.

\subsubsection{Hybrid Geometric Operations and Multimodal Integration}
Beyond changing the embedding space, hybrid frameworks also involve combining different types of geometric operations or integrating KGE with other advanced AI paradigms. \cite{ying2024} proposed **TCompoundE**, a novel Temporal Knowledge Graph Embedding (TKGE) model that leverages *compound geometric operations* for temporal knowledge graph completion. Unlike prior TKGE models that often rely on a single geometric operation (e.g., translation or rotation), TCompoundE integrates both time-specific translation and scaling operations within relation-specific operations. This allows it to capture both dynamic and static aspects of relations over time, demonstrating superior performance in modeling complex, diverse, and dynamically evolving temporal patterns. The combination of operations provides a richer vocabulary for describing temporal changes. Similarly, \cite{chen2022} introduced **RotateQVS**, which represents temporal information as rotations in a quaternion vector space. Quaternions, a generalization of complex numbers, offer a richer mathematical structure for modeling rotations, enabling RotateQVS to capture a comprehensive set of relation patterns, including crucial temporal evolution, with greater expressiveness and interpretability. These models exemplify how combining or extending geometric operations can unlock greater representational power.

At the cutting edge, hybrid frameworks integrate KGE with advanced AI paradigms, moving towards more holistic and intelligent systems. \cite{buehler2024} presents a highly generalized framework for accelerating scientific discovery by combining generative AI, graph-based representation, and multimodal intelligent graph reasoning. This approach employs generative AI to transform scientific papers into an ontological knowledge graph, uses a large language embedding model for deep node representations, and leverages combinatorial node similarity ranking with path sampling to link dissimilar concepts. Crucially, it integrates multimodal intelligent graph reasoning across diverse data (graphs, images, text, numerical data) and even artistic principles for novel material design. This represents a powerful hybrid framework that transcends traditional KGE by integrating it into a broader generative and multimodal reasoning system for complex, cross-domain scientific innovation. Such frameworks demonstrate the future direction of KGE, where embeddings are not just an end in themselves but a crucial component within larger, intelligent systems capable of processing and reasoning over diverse data modalities.
