    "summary": "The foundational papers provided cover a range of methodologies and contributions within Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) and its extensions. They can be broadly categorized into the following method groups for a survey:\n\n---\n\n### Method Groups for the Survey\n\n1.  **Translational Models and Geometric Extensions:** This group focuses on models that build upon the translational paradigm (like TransE) by introducing more sophisticated geometric structures or embedding spaces to enhance expressiveness and address limitations.\n2.  **Temporal and Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding:** This group addresses the dynamic nature of knowledge graphs, either by explicitly modeling time-varying facts or by enabling models to incrementally learn new knowledge without forgetting old information.\n3.  **Graph Neural Network-based Models with Focus on Extrapolation and Interpretability:** This group leverages the power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn rich entity and relation representations, with a specific emphasis on understanding and improving the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.\n4.  **Generative AI and Multimodal Reasoning for Scientific Discovery:** This advanced group explores the integration of generative AI, multimodal data, and sophisticated graph reasoning techniques to push the boundaries of knowledge discovery and innovation, particularly in scientific domains.\n\n---\n\n### Papers Divided into Subgroups\n\n#### Group 1: Translational Models and Geometric Extensions\n\nThis group extends the foundational translational embedding paradigm by introducing more complex geometric structures or by moving beyond traditional Euclidean vector spaces to improve model capacity and address specific limitations like handling complex relation types or regularization.\n\n*   **Subgroup 1.1: Enhancing Relation Modeling within Euclidean Space**\n    *   **Knowledge Graph Embedding by Translating on Hyperplanes (TransH, 2014):**\n        *   **Contribution:** Addresses TransE's inability to handle complex relation mapping properties (one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many) efficiently.\n        *   **Methodology:** Models relations as hyperplanes with translation operations on them. Entities are projected onto the relation-specific hyperplane before translation, allowing for distinct representations of entities involved in complex mappings.\n\n*   **Subgroup 1.2: Exploring Non-Euclidean Embedding Spaces**\n    *   **TorusE: Knowledge Graph Embedding on a Lie Group (2017):**\n        *   **Contribution:** Solves the regularization problem in TransE, where forcing embeddings onto a sphere warps the space and hinders the translation principle.\n        *   **Methodology:** Proposes embedding entities and relations on a compact Lie group, specifically a **torus**. The inherent compactness of the torus naturally regularizes embeddings, avoiding explicit regularization and its adverse effects, while maintaining the translation principle.\n\n#### Group 2: Temporal and Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding\n\nThis group focuses on extending KGE models to handle the evolving nature of knowledge graphs, either by incorporating explicit temporal information or by enabling incremental learning to adapt to new knowledge over time.\n\n*   **Subgroup 2.1: Temporal KGE with Rotation Transformations**\n    *   **ChronoR: Rotation Based Temporal Knowledge Graph Embedding (2021):**\n        *   **Contribution:** Addresses the challenging problem of temporal link prediction in temporal knowledge graphs, which suffer from non-stationarity, heterogeneity, and complex temporal dependencies.\n        *   **Methodology:** Introduces a novel **k-dimensional rotation transformation** parametrized by both relation and time. This rotation transforms a head entity's embedding to be near its tail entity's embedding, capturing rich temporal and multi-relational interactions.\n\n*   **Subgroup 2.2: Continual KGE with Graph Structure Awareness**\n    *   **Towards Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding via Incremental Distillation (IncDE, 2024):**\n        *   **Contribution:** Tackles the problem of continual KGE, aiming to efficiently learn new knowledge while preserving old knowledge, specifically by addressing the neglect of explicit graph structure in existing methods.\n        *   **Methodology:** Proposes IncDE, which includes a **hierarchical strategy** to optimize learning order of new triples based on graph structure, a novel **incremental distillation mechanism** for seamless transfer of entity representations to preserve old knowledge, and a two-stage training paradigm.\n\n#### Group 3: Graph Neural Network-based Models with Focus on Extrapolation and Interpretability\n\nThis group highlights models that utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn representations, with a particular emphasis on understanding *why* KGE models extrapolate and how to design them for better generalization to unseen data.\n\n*   **Subgroup 3.1: Understanding and Enhancing Extrapolation through Semantic Evidences**\n    *   **How Does Knowledge Graph Embedding Extrapolate to Unseen Data: a Semantic Evidence View (SE-GNN, 2021):**\n        *   **Contribution:** Addresses the lack of understanding regarding *why* KGE models extrapolate to unseen data, and how to design models with better extrapolation ability.\n        *   **Methodology:** Identifies three \"Semantic Evidences\" (at relation, entity, and triple levels) that provide crucial semantic information for extrapolation. Proposes **SE-GNN**, a GNN-based model that explicitly models each level of SE through corresponding neighbor patterns and multi-layer aggregation to learn more extrapolative representations.\n\n#### Group 4: Generative AI and Multimodal Reasoning for Scientific Discovery\n\nThis group represents a cutting-edge approach that integrates generative AI, multimodal data processing, and advanced graph reasoning to facilitate scientific discovery, identify novel connections, and even propose new designs across disciplines.\n\n*   **Subgroup 4.1: Multimodal Generative AI for Cross-Domain Scientific Innovation**\n    *   **Accelerating scientific discovery with generative knowledge extraction, graph-based representation, and multimodal intelligent graph reasoning (2024):**\n        *   **Contribution:** Aims to accelerate scientific discovery by transcending disciplinary boundaries, identifying knowledge gaps, and generating novel insights and material designs using advanced AI.\n        *   **Methodology:** Employs **generative AI** to transform scientific papers into an ontological knowledge graph. Uses a **large language embedding model** for deep node representations, and a **combinatorial node similarity ranking with path sampling** to link dissimilar concepts. Leverages **multimodal intelligent graph reasoning** (transitive, isomorphic properties) across diverse data (graphs, images, text, numerical data), even integrating artistic principles for novel material design.",

    "summary": "The papers provided can be broadly categorized into two main method groups, with further subgroups based on their specific contributions and methodologies.\n\n---\n\n### Method Groups for the Survey\n\n**Group 1: Advanced Reasoning Mechanisms for Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs)**\nThis group focuses on extending the reasoning capabilities of KGE models beyond simple pattern recognition, by integrating more explicit forms of logical, analogical, or structured reasoning directly into the embedding and inference processes.\n\n*   **Subgroup 1.1: Logical and Rule-Based Reasoning Integration**\n    *   **Knowledge graph embedding by logical-default attention graph convolution neural network for link prediction (LDAGCN) (2022):** This paper introduces a \"logical-default attention\" mechanism within a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) framework for link prediction. Its contribution lies in attempting to embed logical principles or default assumptions directly into the attention weights, aiming for more robust and interpretable embeddings by guiding the learning process with structured reasoning.\n    *   **Fuzzy Logic based Logical Query Answering on Knowledge Graph (FuzzQE) (2021):** FuzzQE proposes a novel framework for answering First-Order Logical (FOL) queries on Knowledge Graphs by defining logical operators based on fuzzy logic. Its key contribution is providing a principled, learning-free approach to these operators, ensuring axiomatic consistency and significantly reducing the reliance on extensive complex query training data.\n\n*   **Subgroup 1.2: Analogical Inference Enhancement**\n    *   **Analogical Inference Enhanced Knowledge Graph Embedding (AnKGE) (2023):** This paper introduces AnKGE, a self-supervised framework that enhances KGE models with analogical inference capabilities. It contributes by retrieving analogical objects at entity, relation, and triple levels, and adaptively combining analogical scores with base KGE scores for improved link prediction and inductive inference, thereby adding a distinct form of reasoning.\n\n**Group 2: Addressing Scalability and Temporal Dynamics in KGEs**\nThis group tackles practical challenges in KGEs, specifically focusing on improving parameter efficiency for large-scale knowledge graphs and incorporating temporal information for dynamic event prediction.\n\n*   **Subgroup 2.1: Parameter-Efficient Representation Learning**\n    *   **Entity-Agnostic Representation Learning for Parameter-Efficient Knowledge Graph Embedding (EARL) (2023):** EARL addresses the parameter storage cost problem by proposing an \"entity-agnostic\" method. Its core contribution is learning embeddings only for a small set of \"reserved entities\" and dynamically generating embeddings for all other entities by encoding their contextual information (relations, neighbors) using universal, entity-agnostic encoders, leading to significant parameter reduction.\n\n*   **Subgroup 2.2: Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning for Event Prediction**\n    *   **Future Event Prediction Based on Temporal Knowledge Graph Embedding (RE-GAT) (2023):** This paper introduces the Recurrent Event Graph ATtention Network (RE-GAT) for future event prediction on temporal KGs. Its key contribution is a novel historical and concurrent events attention-aware mechanism that simultaneously models patterns from past events and associations of events at the same timestamp within a recurrent framework, offering a more comprehensive approach to temporal reasoning.",

    "summary": "For a survey on recent and trending papers in layer 3 (referring to advanced deep learning methods for trajectory analysis), the provided paper, KGTS, can be categorized into the following method groups based on its contributions and methodologies:\n\n### Method Groups for Survey\n\n1.  **Spatial Contextual Embedding / Graph-based Spatial Encoding:**\n    *   **Focus:** Methods that aim to represent the underlying geographical environment (e.g., grids, road networks, POIs) in a rich, structured embedding space to provide context for trajectory data. These often leverage graph-based techniques to capture spatial relationships.\n    *   **KGTS Contribution:** KGTS contributes to this group by employing a **Knowledge Graph Grid Embedding (GRot embedding)** method. This specifically focuses on embedding map grids to vigorously grasp their neighboring relations, providing a foundational spatial context for subsequent trajectory processing.\n\n2.  **Trajectory Representation Learning / Prompt-Enhanced Trajectory Embedding:**\n    *   **Focus:** Techniques dedicated to learning dense, meaningful vector representations (embeddings) for entire trajectories. These methods often integrate sequential, structural, and contextual information, and may use advanced paradigms like prompt learning to guide the embedding process.\n    *   **KGTS Contribution:** KGTS introduces a **Prompt Trajectory Embedding Network**. This network incorporates the learned grid embeddings and extracts trajectory structure and point order information. A key innovation here is the use of a **customized prompt paradigm** to mitigate the representational gap between the grid embeddings and the trajectory embeddings, enhancing the quality and relevance of the trajectory representations.\n\n3.  **Self-supervised / Contrastive Learning for Trajectory Similarity:**\n    *   **Focus:** Approaches that utilize self-supervision, particularly contrastive learning, to train trajectory embedding models. The goal is to learn a metric space where similar trajectories are close and dissimilar ones are far apart, often without requiring extensive labeled similarity pairs, thereby improving generality and reducing data preprocessing burdens.\n    *   **KGTS Contribution:** KGTS significantly contributes to this group by training its prompt trajectory embedding network using **unsupervised contrastive learning**. This involves creatively designed strategies for positive sample generation, which not only alleviates the heavy preprocessing burden but also provides exceptional generality, making the learned embeddings robust for similarity computation across diverse datasets.\n\n### Subgrouping for KGTS (based on its integrated approach)\n\nThe KGTS paper uniquely integrates methodologies from all three of these groups, making its primary contribution a holistic framework that addresses multiple limitations simultaneously.\n\n*   **KGTS as an Integrated Framework for Robust Trajectory Similarity Learning:**\n    *   **Contributions:** KGTS combines **Knowledge Graph Grid Embedding** (for spatial context), **Prompt Trajectory Embedding** (for enhanced trajectory representation), and **Unsupervised Contrastive Learning** (for efficient and generalizable training). This integration allows it to achieve superior performance, high generality, and reduced preprocessing compared to state-of-the-art methods. Its novelty lies in the synergistic combination and adaptation of these advanced techniques, particularly the customized prompt paradigm and creative positive sample generation strategies.",
