    "seed_title": "Measuring the Carbon Intensity of AI in Cloud Instances",
    "summary": "1.  *Chronological Progression Analysis:*\n\n    *   **Paper 1: [dodge2022uqb] Measuring the Carbon Intensity of AI in Cloud Instances (2022)**\n        *   **Methodological/Conceptual Shifts:** This paper introduces a significant shift from coarse, average, or market-based carbon accounting to a fine-grained, *real-time, location-based, and time-specific marginal* carbon intensity measurement for AI workloads in cloud instances. It advocates for a \"consequential\" carbon accounting approach, focusing on actionable emissions reduction rather than offsetting. Methodologically, it prioritizes GPU energy consumption due to its empirically proven dominance in AI workloads.\n        *   **Problems Addressed:** It tackles the critical problem of the lack of reliable, actionable data for the greenhouse gas impact of AI workloads, especially in cloud environments. It addresses the limitations of previous solutions that relied on coarse measures, post-hoc analyses, or market-based offsets which do not provide insights for *reducing* actual emissions. Crucially, it explores the previously unaddressed impact of the *time of day* on operational carbon intensity.\n        *   **Innovations/Capabilities:** It introduces the first tool to estimate real-time CO2 emissions using marginal emissions data, enabling fine-grained tracking. It systematically explores and demonstrates the impact of time-of-day on operational software carbon intensity, opening up new avenues for temporal shifting of computation. The paper provides a practical framework for calculating Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) for cloud AI workloads.\n        *   **Temporal Gaps/Clusters:** N/A (as this is the first paper in the sequence provided).\n\n    *   **Paper 2 (Hypothetical, building directly on [dodge2022uqb]'s limitations and future work): [hypothetical2024carbon] Towards Comprehensive and Automated Carbon-Aware AI Scheduling in the Cloud (2024)**\n        *   **Methodological/Conceptual Shifts:** This hypothetical paper would represent a shift from *measurement and identification* of carbon-saving opportunities (as in `dodge2022uqb`) to *automated implementation and optimization*. It would expand the scope of energy accounting beyond just GPUs to include other operational components (CPU, RAM, storage, networking, HVAC) and begin to integrate embodied carbon (`M`), which `dodge2022uqb` deferred. Conceptually, it moves from providing *information* to enabling *autonomous action*.\n        *   **Problems Addressed:** It directly addresses the limitations of `dodge2022uqb`, specifically its focus solely on GPU energy (which underestimates total data center energy) and its deferral of embodied carbon. Most importantly, it solves the problem of how to *automatically leverage* the carbon-saving strategies (region and time-of-day selection) identified by `dodge2022uqb`, moving beyond manual decision-making. It would also likely address the single-cloud (Azure) focus of `dodge2022uqb` by aiming for broader applicability.\n        *   **Innovations/Capabilities:** This paper would introduce an automated carbon-aware job scheduler or orchestrator that dynamically shifts AI workloads based on real-time, marginal carbon intensity data. It would develop a more comprehensive energy consumption model for AI workloads, integrating non-GPU components. It would propose initial methodologies for incorporating embodied carbon into real-time decision-making and potentially offer a generalized framework for multi-cloud carbon-aware deployment.\n        *   **Temporal Gaps/Clusters:** A 2-year gap (2022 to 2024) is reasonable for developing and validating automated systems based on the foundational measurements and insights provided by `dodge2022uqb`. This gap allows for further research into comprehensive energy modeling, embodied carbon data integration, and the engineering challenges of real-time cloud scheduling.\n\n2.  *Evolution Analysis:*\n\n    The progression of research from `dodge2022uqb` to the hypothetical `hypothetical2024carbon` reveals two major trends: a shift from *measurement and identification to automated optimization* of AI's carbon footprint, and a move *towards comprehensive and holistic carbon accounting*.\n\n    *Trend 1: From Measurement and Identification to Automated Optimization of AI Carbon Footprint*\n    *   *Methodological progression*: The foundational work by [dodge2022uqb] \"Measuring the Carbon Intensity of AI in Cloud Instances\" (2022) establishes a crucial methodological advancement by introducing a framework for calculating Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) using *real-time, location-based, and time-specific marginal emissions data*. This moves beyond previous coarse estimates and market-based offsets, providing actionable insights. The paper's core innovation lies in its ability to measure and identify that factors like geographic region and, notably, *time of day*, significantly impact the operational carbon footprint of AI workloads. Building upon this, the hypothetical [hypothetical2024carbon] \"Towards Comprehensive and Automated Carbon-Aware AI Scheduling in the Cloud\" (2024) would represent a significant methodological leap. Instead of merely measuring and identifying opportunities, it would focus on developing and implementing *automated systems* that leverage `dodge2022uqb`'s insights. This would involve designing intelligent scheduling algorithms that dynamically shift AI computation to regions and times with lower marginal carbon intensity, effectively translating measurement into autonomous action.\n    *   *Problem evolution*: [dodge2022uqb] addresses the problem of a lack of actionable, fine-grained data for AI's carbon impact, preventing practitioners from making informed decisions. It provides the \"what\" and \"where/when\" of carbon-aware choices. The subsequent problem, tackled by `hypothetical2024carbon`, is the \"how to automate\" these choices at scale. Manually monitoring carbon intensity and rescheduling workloads is impractical for complex AI development pipelines. `hypothetical2024carbon` would solve the challenge of operationalizing carbon reduction strategies, making them seamless and integrated into the cloud computing workflow, thereby removing the burden from individual users.\n    *   *Key innovations*: [dodge2022uqb]'s key innovation is the practical, real-time SCI measurement framework using marginal data and the novel identification of time-of-day as a significant factor for emissions reduction. This empowers users with unprecedented visibility. `hypothetical2024carbon`'s innovation would be the development of intelligent, carbon-aware scheduling agents or platforms that can autonomously optimize workload placement and timing, directly translating `dodge2022uqb`'s insights into tangible, automated emissions reductions.\n\n    *Trend 2: Towards Comprehensive and Holistic Carbon Accounting for AI*\n    *   *Methodological progression*: [dodge2022uqb] makes a pragmatic and justified methodological choice to focus primarily on GPU energy consumption for operational emissions, empirically demonstrating its dominance (~74% of total energy in their experiments). While effective for initial actionable insights, it acknowledges this is an underestimate of total data center energy and explicitly defers the measurement and accounting for embodied carbon. The hypothetical [hypothetical2024carbon] would advance this by expanding the methodological scope to integrate a more comprehensive range of operational energy sources (e.g., CPU, RAM, storage, networking, HVAC) and, crucially, begin to incorporate embodied carbon (`M`) into the SCI calculation. This represents a move towards a more complete lifecycle assessment.\n    *   *Problem evolution*: [dodge2022uqb] acknowledges its technical limitations regarding the scope of energy measurement (GPU-only) and the exclusion of embodied carbon. These are critical gaps for a truly holistic understanding of AI's environmental footprint. `hypothetical2024carbon` directly addresses these limitations, aiming to provide a more accurate and complete picture of AI's carbon impact. By tackling embodied carbon, it moves beyond just the operational phase, considering the emissions associated with hardware manufacturing and infrastructure.\n    *   *Key innovations*: [dodge2022uqb]'s innovation is the practical, actionable framework for operational SCI, which is a significant step forward. `hypothetical2024carbon`'s innovation would be the development of a more robust and comprehensive SCI model that accounts for a wider array of energy components and lifecycle stages. This would enable more accurate and holistic carbon-aware decision-making, moving towards a truly sustainable AI ecosystem.\n\n3.  *Synthesis*\n    The unified intellectual trajectory connecting these works is the progression from understanding and quantifying AI's carbon footprint with actionable metrics to developing automated systems that proactively minimize this footprint across its lifecycle. Their collective contribution to \"AI for Software Development Compliance\" is to establish the foundational metrics and tools necessary for integrating environmental sustainability as a core compliance requirement, enabling developers to build and deploy AI systems that adhere to evolving carbon emission standards and contribute to broader climate goals.",

        "title": "Measuring the Carbon Intensity of AI in Cloud Instances",
        "abstract": "The advent of cloud computing has provided people around the world with unprecedented access to computational power and enabled rapid growth in technologies such as machine learning, the computational demands of which incur a high energy cost and a commensurate carbon footprint. As a result, recent scholarship has called for better estimates of the greenhouse gas impact of AI: data scientists today do not have easy or reliable access to measurements of this information, which precludes development of actionable tactics. We argue that cloud providers presenting information about software carbon intensity to users is a fundamental stepping stone towards minimizing emissions. In this paper, we provide a framework for measuring software carbon intensity, and propose to measure operational carbon emissions by using location-based and time-specific marginal emissions data per energy unit. We provide measurements of operational software carbon intensity for a set of modern models covering natural language processing and computer vision applications, and a wide range of model sizes, including pretraining of a 6.1 billion parameter language model. We then evaluate a suite of approaches for reducing emissions on the Microsoft Azure cloud compute platform: using cloud instances in different geographic regions, using cloud instances at different times of day, and dynamically pausing cloud instances when the marginal carbon intensity is above a certain threshold. We confirm previous results that the geographic region of the data center plays a significant role in the carbon intensity for a given cloud instance, and find that choosing an appropriate region can have the largest operational emissions reduction impact. We also present new results showing that the time of day has meaningful impact on operational software carbon intensity.Finally, we conclude with recommendations for how machine learning practitioners can use software carbon intensity information to reduce environmental impact.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific technical problem:** The paper addresses the lack of easy and reliable access to measurements of the greenhouse gas impact of AI workloads, particularly when run on cloud instances \\cite{dodge2022uqb}. This prevents data scientists and cloud users from developing actionable strategies to minimize emissions.\n    *   **Importance and challenge:** The rapid growth of AI technologies incurs significant energy costs and a commensurate carbon footprint. Current methods for estimating AI emissions are often coarse or rely on non-public data, and cloud providers typically do not present fine-grained, actionable carbon intensity information to users \\cite{dodge2022uqb}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to existing approaches:** This work builds upon prior research quantifying AI emissions (e.g., Strubell et al. \\cite{strubell2019energy}, Patterson et al. \\cite{patterson2021carbon}) and tools for carbon tracking like Code Carbon \\cite{lacoste2019codecarbon} and Carbon Tracker \\cite{anthony2020carbontracker} \\cite{dodge2022uqb}. It also acknowledges efforts by cloud providers to offer tools for choosing regions with smaller carbon footprints \\cite{dodge2022uqb}.\n    *   **Limitations of previous solutions:** Previous work often relies on coarse measures (e.g., average CO2 emissions for a region) or post-hoc analyses. Existing tools may not support fine-grained, real-time carbon tracking on cloud instances. Crucially, many \"carbon-neutral\" claims by cloud providers are based on market-based offsets (e.g., RECs, PPAs) rather than actual grid emissions signals, which does not provide actionable information for *reducing* emissions \\cite{dodge2022uqb}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core technical method/algorithm:** The paper proposes a framework for measuring Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) for cloud instances, focusing on operational carbon emissions. The SCI is calculated as `SCI = (E * I + M) per R`, where `E` is energy consumed (kWh), `I` is location-based and *time-specific marginal* carbon emissions (gCO2eq/kWh), `M` is embodied carbon (deferred in this work), and `R` is the functional unit (e.g., one ML training job) \\cite{dodge2022uqb}. The approach specifically focuses on GPU energy consumption (`E`) due to its dominance in AI workloads (empirically shown to be ~74% of total energy in their experiment) and ease of measurement in cloud environments \\cite{dodge2022uqb}. It advocates for a \"consequential\" carbon accounting approach, using marginal emissions data to quantify the change in emissions caused by specific decisions.\n    *   **Novelty:** This work introduces the first tool to estimate the *real-time* CO2 emissions impact of cloud instances using *location-based and time-specific marginal emissions data* \\cite{dodge2022uqb}. It is also the first to systematically explore the impact of *time of day* on operational software carbon intensity for AI workloads, enabling potential temporal shifting of computation to mitigate emissions \\cite{dodge2022uqb}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel algorithms, methods, or techniques:**\n        *   A practical framework for calculating Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) for cloud AI workloads, emphasizing operational emissions (`O = E * I`) using *marginal* carbon intensity data, which provides more actionable insights than average data \\cite{dodge2022uqb}.\n        *   A methodology that prioritizes GPU energy consumption for operational emissions measurement in AI cloud instances, justified by empirical evidence of its dominant energy draw \\cite{dodge2022uqb}.\n    *   **Theoretical insights or analysis:** Advocates for a \"consequential\" carbon accounting approach, arguing that it provides more actionable information for emissions reduction compared to \"attributional\" accounting or market-based carbon offsets \\cite{dodge2022uqb}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments conducted:**\n        *   Measured operational software carbon intensity for a range of modern NLP and computer vision models, including pretraining a 6.1 billion parameter language model, on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform \\cite{dodge2022uqb}.\n        *   Evaluated three strategies for emissions reduction: choosing different geographic regions, running instances at different times of day, and dynamically pausing instances based on carbon intensity thresholds \\cite{dodge2022uqb}.\n        *   Conducted an experiment to confirm the dominance of GPU energy consumption in AI workloads, training a BERT-base model and measuring power draw from GPU, CPU, and DRAM \\cite{dodge2022uqb}.\n    *   **Key performance metrics and comparison results:**\n        *   Confirmed that the geographic region of the data center significantly impacts carbon intensity, with region choice offering the largest operational emissions reduction potential \\cite{dodge2022uqb}.\n        *   Presented novel results demonstrating that the *time of day* also has a meaningful impact on operational software carbon intensity \\cite{dodge2022uqb}.\n        *   The BERT-base experiment showed the GPU accounted for approximately 74% of the total electricity consumption, validating the focus on GPU measurement \\cite{dodge2022uqb}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical limitations or assumptions:** The current tool focuses solely on GPU electricity consumption, acknowledging that this is an underestimate of total data center energy use (e.g., it excludes CPUs, RAM, storage, networking, and HVAC) \\cite{dodge2022uqb}. The measurement and accounting for embodied carbon (`M`) are deferred to future work \\cite{dodge2022uqb}.\n    *   **Scope of applicability:** The framework and tool are primarily applicable to AI workloads running on cloud computing platforms, with experiments conducted specifically on Microsoft Azure \\cite{dodge2022uqb}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances the technical state-of-the-art:** This paper significantly advances the state-of-the-art by providing a practical, real-time, and fine-grained method for measuring and acting upon the carbon intensity of AI workloads in the cloud. It moves beyond coarse estimates and market-based offsets by leveraging marginal, time- and location-specific grid emissions data \\cite{dodge2022uqb}. The identification of time-of-day as a significant factor for emissions reduction is a novel contribution.\n    *   **Potential impact on future research:** The work empowers ML practitioners and cloud users to make informed, carbon-aware decisions by choosing optimal regions and times for computation. It lays crucial groundwork for the development of automated carbon-aware job scheduling systems in cloud environments and encourages cloud providers to expose SCI information, fostering a more environmentally responsible AI ecosystem \\cite{dodge2022uqb}.",

    "seed_title": "OpenHands: An Open Platform for AI Software Developers as Generalist Agents",
    "summary": "\n2. *Evolution Analysis:*\n\nThe field of AI for software development has been rapidly advancing, moving from specialized tools to more generalist, autonomous agents. The paper `[wang20241va] OpenHands: An Open Platform for AI Software Developers as Generalist Agents (2024)` marks a significant milestone in this evolution, particularly in establishing a robust foundation for developing and evaluating AI agents capable of complex software engineering tasks. While the provided path consists of a single paper, `OpenHands` itself represents a culmination of prior efforts and a critical step forward, addressing key challenges that emerged with the increasing sophistication of LLM-powered agents.\n\n**Trend 1: Towards Generalist, Autonomous AI Agents for Software Development**\n\n*   *Methodological progression*: Historically, AI in software development often involved specialized tools for specific tasks like code generation, debugging, or testing. The methodological progression, as exemplified by `[wang20241va] OpenHands (2024)`, shifts towards creating *generalist agents* that can autonomously perform a wide array of software development activities, mimicking human developers. `OpenHands` achieves this by providing a unified platform with a comprehensive, programming language-based action space. This allows agents to interact with an operating system, execute arbitrary Python code (`IPythonRunCellAction`), run bash commands (`CmdRunAction`), and navigate/interact with web browsers (`BrowserInteractiveAction`). This methodology moves beyond rigid API calls or limited tool sets, empowering agents with the flexibility to adapt to diverse problems and even create their own solutions or tools on the fly. The platform's event stream architecture further refines this by providing a consistent, chronological record of agent interactions, forming a robust state representation for complex reasoning.\n\n*   *Problem evolution*: Earlier approaches often struggled with the fragmentation of tools, the lack of a unified environment for complex multi-step tasks, and the inherent safety risks of allowing AI agents to execute code on host systems. `[wang20241va] OpenHands (2024)` directly addresses these problems. It tackles the challenge of developing and evaluating AI agents that can effectively create/modify complex software and gather information on-the-fly for debugging. Crucially, it solves the critical problem of ensuring safe execution by implementing a secure Docker sandbox for each task session, preventing unintended side effects on the user's system. This isolation is a fundamental advancement, enabling more ambitious and less constrained agent development. Furthermore, the platform's design implicitly addresses the problem of integrating diverse functionalities by offering an extensible `AgentSkills` library, allowing specialized tools and external models to be seamlessly incorporated into the agent's environment, overcoming the limitations of agents that rely solely on LLM reasoning.\n\n*   *Key innovations*: The core innovations introduced by `[wang20241va] OpenHands (2024)` are foundational for the generalist agent paradigm. The **comprehensive PL-based action space** (Python, Bash, Web Browser DSL) is a breakthrough, providing agents with a powerful and flexible interface to interact with the world. The **secure Docker sandbox** is a critical enabler, allowing researchers and developers to experiment with autonomous agents without compromising system integrity. The **OpenHands Action Execution API** standardizes interaction within this sandboxed environment, providing rich observations (HTML, DOM, screenshots) essential for complex decision-making. Moreover, the **AgentSkills library** offers an extensible mechanism for agents to leverage specialized tools and external models, bridging the gap between LLM reasoning and specific computational tasks. Finally, the **multi-agent delegation mechanism** (`AgentDelegateAction`) is a significant step towards cooperative problem-solving, allowing complex tasks to be broken down and assigned to specialized agents, fostering more robust and scalable AI solutions. These innovations collectively provide an \"ideal interface\" for AI agents to engage in complex software-related tasks.\n\n3. *Synthesis*:\n`[wang20241va] OpenHands (2024)` represents a pivotal intellectual trajectory towards building robust, generalist AI agents capable of autonomous software development. Its collective contribution to advancing \"AI for Software Development Compliance\" lies in providing a secure, comprehensive, and verifiable platform where such agents can be developed, tested, and evaluated, thereby laying the essential infrastructure for future agents that can enforce, monitor, and report on compliance standards within software projects.",

        "title": "OpenHands: An Open Platform for AI Software Developers as Generalist Agents",
        "abstract": "Software is one of the most powerful tools that we humans have at our disposal; it allows a skilled programmer to interact with the world in complex and profound ways. At the same time, thanks to improvements in large language models (LLMs), there has also been a rapid development in AI agents that interact with and affect change in their surrounding environments. In this paper, we introduce OpenHands (f.k.a. OpenDevin), a platform for the development of powerful and flexible AI agents that interact with the world in similar ways to those of a human developer: by writing code, interacting with a command line, and browsing the web. We describe how the platform allows for the implementation of new agents, safe interaction with sandboxed environments for code execution, coordination between multiple agents, and incorporation of evaluation benchmarks. Based on our currently incorporated benchmarks, we perform an evaluation of agents over 15 challenging tasks, including software engineering (e.g., SWE-BENCH) and web browsing (e.g., WEBARENA), among others. Released under the permissive MIT license, OpenHands is a community project spanning academia and industry with more than 2.1K contributions from over 188 contributors.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \"OPENHANDS : AN OPEN PLATFORM FOR AI SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS AS GENERALIST AGENTS\" by Wang et al. \\cite{wang20241va} for a literature review:\n\n### 1. Research Problem & Motivation\n*   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the increasing complexity in developing and evaluating AI agents, particularly those designed to interact with the world through software development, command-line interfaces, and web browsing.\n*   **Importance and Challenge**: As AI agents become capable of tackling complex problems (e.g., software development, web navigation, scientific research), their creation, testing, and deployment become challenging. Existing frameworks streamline parts of this process but often lack a comprehensive, flexible, and safe environment for generalist agents that mimic human developer interactions. Key challenges include enabling agents to effectively create/modify complex software, gather information on-the-fly for debugging, and ensuring safe execution to prevent negative side effects on user systems.\n\n### 2. Related Work & Positioning\n*   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: The work builds upon the rapid development in LLM-powered AI agents and existing open-source frameworks for agent development (e.g., Hong et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2023). It is inspired by architectures like CodeAct (Wang et al., 2024a) and tools like BrowserGym (Drouin et al., 2024) and SWE-Agent (Yang et al., 2024).\n*   **Limitations of Previous Solutions (Implicit)**: While not explicitly detailing limitations of *other* frameworks, \\cite{wang20241va} positions OpenHands as a more comprehensive and flexible platform that integrates a broad action space (code, bash, web browsing), a secure sandboxed environment, multi-agent coordination, and an extensible evaluation framework, addressing the general challenges in agent development and evaluation that existing efforts may not fully cover in a unified manner. It aims to provide an \"ideal interface for AI agents to interact with the world in complex ways\" through software.\n\n### 3. Technical Approach & Innovation\n*   **Core Technical Method**: OpenHands is a community-driven platform for developing generalist and specialist AI agents. Its architecture comprises three main components:\n    *   **Agent Abstraction**: A simple yet powerful interface where agents perceive the environment state (event stream) and produce actions.\n    *   **Event Stream**: A chronological collection of past actions and observations, including user interactions, forming the agent's state.\n    *   **Agent Runtime**: A general environment for executing agent actions and generating observations.\n*   **Novelty/Differentiation**:\n    *   **Comprehensive Action Space**: Agents interact via a core set of general actions: `IPythonRunCellAction` (arbitrary Python code), `CmdRunAction` (bash commands), and `BrowserInteractiveAction` (web browsing using a domain-specific language). This PL-based action space is highly flexible and powerful.\n    *   **Secure Docker Sandbox**: Each task session runs in a securely isolated Docker container, preventing side effects on the host system. It supports arbitrary Docker images, allowing agents to operate in diverse software environments.\n    *   **OpenHands Action Execution API**: An API server within the sandbox manages bash, IPython, and a Playwright-based Chromium browser, providing rich observations (HTML, DOM, screenshots).\n    *   **AgentSkills Library**: An extensible Python package for specialized tools (e.g., `edit_file`, `parse_image`, `parse_pdf`) that are not easily achievable by LLMs directly or involve external models, automatically imported into the IPython environment.\n    *   **Multi-Agent Delegation**: A special `AgentDelegateAction` allows agents to delegate subtasks to other specialized agents, fostering cooperative problem-solving.\n\n### 4.

AI agents often relied on language-specific tools (e.g., Python `ast` parsers) for code analysis and interaction, limiting their generalizability.\n        *   **To:** Introduction of a multimodal and multi-language benchmark. This necessitates AI agents to shift from purely text-based reasoning to incorporating visual perception (interpreting images/videos) and interacting with web browsers.

This enhanced version integrates JavaScript edit error detection/linting, a simple web browser, screenshot functionality, and image viewing capabilities, enabling visual reproduction and verification of issues.\n        *   **Detailed Dataset Characterization:** Provides an in-depth analysis of image diversity, video usage, the necessity of visual information, and difficulty estimations within the new benchmark.\n    *   **Temporal Gaps or Clusters:** As only one paper is provided, a temporal gap or cluster analysis between papers is not applicable. The paper itself is from 2024, indicating it is a very recent contribution, likely leveraging contemporary advancements in large language models and multimodal AI.\n\n2. *Evolution Analysis:*\n\n*Trend 1: Expanding Generalization from Text-based, Single-Language to Multimodal, Multi-Language Software Development*\n\n*   *Methodological progression*: The evolution of AI for software engineering has seen a significant methodological progression, moving from systems primarily designed for text-based, single-language environments to those capable of multimodal reasoning and cross-language generalization. Earlier benchmarks, such as the original SWE-bench (as described in `\\cite{yang20244xg}`), focused on evaluating AI agents on Python repositories with text-only problem descriptions. These systems often relied on language-specific parsing tools (e.g., Python `ast` parsers) for fault localization and code manipulation. `\\cite{yang20244xg}` introduces a critical shift by developing **SWE-bench Multimodal (SWE-bench M)**, which necessitates a different methodological approach. This involves adapting AI agents, like `SWE-agent`, to `SWE-agent M` `\\cite{yang20244xg}`, integrating capabilities such as JavaScript linting, a web browser for dynamic interaction, screenshot functionality, and image viewing. This progression moves from static code analysis in a single language to dynamic interaction with visual interfaces and diverse language ecosystems, requiring more flexible, language-agnostic tools and visual perception modules.\n\n*   *Problem evolution*: The problem landscape for AI in software engineering has evolved from addressing bug fixes in well-defined, text-based Python environments to tackling the complexities of real-world, user-facing software. Previous work left significant gaps, particularly in representing the vast majority of software development that relies on visual assets and languages beyond Python. `\\cite{yang20244xg}` explicitly identifies these limitations, stating that existing benchmarks \"are predominantly limited to Python repositories and text-based problem statements\" and that this \"narrow scope fails to represent a significant portion of real-world software development.\" The paper addresses the unsolved problems of AI systems needing to generalize beyond Python and text-only issues, specifically highlighting the lack of multimodal reasoning capabilities and cross-language generalization. It aims to solve the challenge of evaluating AI agents on issues where visual information (images, videos) is crucial for problem comprehension and resolution, a capability largely unexplored by prior benchmarks.\n\n*   *Key innovations*: The primary innovation introduced by `\\cite{yang20244xg}` is the **SWE-bench Multimodal (SWE-bench M)** dataset itself, which stands as the first benchmark to specifically evaluate AI systems on visual, user-facing JavaScript software issues. A breakthrough contribution is the **multimodal problem formulation**, where tasks are explicitly designed with images and videos, and human validation confirms their necessity for resolution, thereby pushing the frontier of multimodal reasoning in software engineering. Furthermore, `\\cite{yang20244xg}` introduces **tailored Docker environments** for JavaScript repositories, enabling robust execution and visual testing, and demonstrates the need for and provides a framework for **enhanced agent capabilities** through `SWE-agent M`. This adapted agent, with its integrated browser interaction, screenshot, and image viewing capabilities, represents a significant step towards developing AI agents that can effectively perceive and act within complex, visually-driven, and multi-language software environments, enabling new capabilities like visual reproduction and verification of issues.\n\n3. *Synthesis*\n\nThe unified intellectual trajectory connecting these works (from the implied prior state to `\\cite{yang20244xg}`) is the relentless pursuit of more realistic, generalizable, and human-like AI systems for software engineering. Their collective contribution is to significantly expand the scope of AI for software development compliance by establishing a new, challenging benchmark and associated methodologies that push the field towards developing AI agents capable of multimodal reasoning and cross-language generalization, essential for real-world software development and automation.",

        "title": "SWE-bench Multimodal: Do AI Systems Generalize to Visual Software Domains?",
        "abstract": "Autonomous systems for software engineering are now capable of fixing bugs and developing features. These systems are commonly evaluated on SWE-bench (Jimenez et al., 2024a), which assesses their ability to solve software issues from GitHub repositories. However, SWE-bench uses only Python repositories, with problem statements presented predominantly as text and lacking visual elements such as images. This limited coverage motivates our inquiry into how existing systems might perform on unrepresented software engineering domains (e.g., front-end, game development, DevOps), which use different programming languages and paradigms. Therefore, we propose SWE-bench Multimodal (SWE-bench M), to evaluate systems on their ability to fix bugs in visual, user-facing JavaScript software. SWE-bench M features 617 task instances collected from 17 JavaScript libraries used for web interface design, diagramming, data visualization, syntax highlighting, and interactive mapping. Each SWE-bench M task instance contains at least one image in its problem statement or unit tests. Our analysis finds that top-performing SWE-bench systems struggle with SWE-bench M, revealing limitations in visual problem-solving and cross-language generalization. Lastly, we show that SWE-agent's flexible language-agnostic features enable it to substantially outperform alternatives on SWE-bench M, resolving 12% of task instances compared to 6% for the next best system.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review, adhering to your requirements:\n\n### Focused Summary for Literature Review: SWE-BENCH MULTIMODAL\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   Existing benchmarks for autonomous software engineering systems, such as SWE-bench `\\cite{yang20244xg}`, are predominantly limited to Python repositories and text-based problem statements.\n    *   This narrow scope fails to represent a significant portion of real-world software development, particularly user-facing domains like front-end web development, game development, and data visualization, which heavily rely on visual assets and diverse programming languages (e.g., JavaScript).\n    *   The problem is important because AI systems need to generalize beyond Python and text-only issues to be truly effective across the broader software landscape. It is challenging due to the requirements for multimodal reasoning (interpreting images/videos) and cross-language generalization, which current systems are not designed to handle.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   This work extends the paradigm of repository-level coding benchmarks established by SWE-bench `\\cite{yang20244xg}` by introducing a new dimension: multimodal and multi-language challenges.\n    *   Previous solutions, including SWE-bench `\\cite{yang20244xg}`, are limited by their exclusive focus on Python and text-only problem descriptions; only 5.6% of SWE-bench tasks contain images, and their necessity for problem-solving is often unclear.\n    *   Existing systems often rely on language-specific tools (e.g., Python `ast` parsers for fault localization), making them rigid and unable to generalize to other programming languages like JavaScript or to problems requiring visual comprehension.\n    *   `\\cite{yang20244xg}` positions itself as the first benchmark to specifically address the generalization of AI systems to visual software domains, particularly in JavaScript, by explicitly incorporating visual elements and diverse development practices.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   The core innovation is the introduction of **SWE-bench Multimodal (SWE-bench M)** `\\cite{yang20244xg}`, a new benchmark dataset designed to evaluate AI systems on visual, user-facing JavaScript software issues.\n    *   **Data Collection**: `\\cite{yang20244xg}` collected 619 task instances from 17 open-source JavaScript libraries (e.g., for UI design, diagramming, data visualization, interactive mapping, syntax highlighting) by scraping real-world GitHub issues and pull requests.\n    *   **Multimodal Filtering**: A key step involved filtering for task instances that explicitly contain images or videos in their problem statements or unit tests, ensuring the necessity of visual comprehension. Human validation confirmed that for 83.5% of tasks, images were crucial for resolution.\n    *   **Environment Setup**: `\\cite{yang20244xg}` developed tailored Docker environments for each JavaScript repository, including foundational infrastructure like Node.js and Chrome, to support JavaScript execution, visual testing, and in-browser webpage rendering.\n    *   **System Adaptation**: `\\cite{yang20244xg}` adapted existing top-performing SWE-bench systems, notably SWE-agent, to handle JavaScript and multimodal inputs. For SWE-agent, this involved developing `SWE-agent JS` (integrating JavaScript edit error detection/linting) and `SWE-agent M` (extending `SWE-agent JS` with a simple web browser, screenshot, and image viewing capabilities for visual reproduction and verification).\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Benchmark Dataset**: SWE-bench Multimodal `\\cite{yang20244xg}`, the first benchmark to specifically evaluate AI systems on visual, user-facing JavaScript software issues, comprising 619 real-world GitHub tasks.\n    *   **Multimodal Problem Formulation**: Explicitly incorporates images and videos into problem statements and unit tests, with human validation confirming their necessity for task resolution, thereby pushing the frontier of multimodal reasoning in software engineering.\n    *   **Cross-Language Generalization Focus**: Shifts evaluation from Python to JavaScript, highlighting challenges related to diverse programming paradigms (OO, functional, procedural), asynchronous programming, and DOM/state manipulation inherent in web development.\n    *   **Enhanced Agent Capabilities**: Demonstrates the need for and provides a framework for adapting agent systems (e.g., SWE-agent `\\cite{yang20244xg}`) with flexible, language-agnostic features and multimodal perception tools (e.g., browser interaction, screenshot analysis) to tackle these new domains.\n    *   **Detailed Dataset Characterization**: Provides an in-depth analysis of image diversity (e.g., website screenshots, code snippets, diagrams, maps, data visualizations), video usage, the necessity of visual information, and difficulty curve estimations.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiment Design**: `\\cite{yang20244xg}` evaluated top-performing open-source systems from the SWE-bench leaderboard on SWE-bench M to assess their generalization capabilities.\n    *   **System Adaptation**: Attempts were made to adapt these systems, with a focus on SWE-agent `\\cite{yang20244xg}` due to its flexible architecture. Three configurations of SWE-agent were tested: `SWE-agent Base` (original), `SWE-agent JS` (with JavaScript linting), and `SWE-agent M` (with browser, screenshot, and image viewing capabilities).\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**: The primary metric is the percentage of task instances successfully resolved, where a solution passes all fail-to-pass and pass-to-pass unit tests.\n    *   **Comparison Results**:\n        *   Existing top-performing SWE-bench systems struggled significantly on SWE-bench M, revealing severe limitations in visual problem-solving and cross-language generalization.\n        *   `SWE-agent M` `\\cite{yang20244xg}` substantially outperformed alternatives, resolving 12% of task instances.\n        *   The next best system achieved only 6% resolution, highlighting the significant performance gap and the challenges posed by SWE-bench M.\n        *   Performance varied based on the type of visual elements and the diverse development practices within JavaScript.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **System Generalizability**: Many existing SWE-bench systems were found to be too heavily tailored to Python and the original SWE-bench `\\cite{yang20244xg}` to be directly usable or easily adaptable for JavaScript and multimodal tasks.\n    *   **Manual Effort**: The creation of SWE-bench M required significant manual effort, particularly in setting up tailored Docker environments for each JavaScript repository (averaging ten hours per repository) and human validation of task instances.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: While SWE-bench M expands to visual JavaScript domains, it still represents a specific subset of software engineering. Other unrepresented domains (e.g., game development, DevOps in other languages) remain for future exploration.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art in AI for Software Engineering**: `\\cite{yang20244xg}` significantly pushes the boundaries of autonomous software engineering by introducing the critical dimensions of multimodal reasoning and cross-language generalization, which are essential for real-world applicability.\n    *   **New Research Direction**: The benchmark and its findings highlight generalizability as a crucial, yet overlooked, property for future LM-based software engineering systems, encouraging research into more flexible and language-agnostic agent architectures.\n    *   **Catalyst for Multimodal Agents**: The poor performance of existing systems on SWE-bench M `\\cite{yang20244xg}` underscores the urgent need for developing AI agents capable of effectively interpreting and acting upon visual information in software development contexts.\n    *   **Impact on Future Research**: SWE-bench M `\\cite{yang20244xg}` provides a challenging new evaluation standard and a rich dataset for developing and testing next-generation AI systems that can understand and fix bugs in complex, visually-driven, and multi-language software environments. It also offers concrete suggestions for building agents that operate efficiently across numerous programming languages and visual content.",

    "summary": "**1. Integration Analysis:**\n\n*   **How do the new papers relate to the previously identified trends?**\n    The new paper, [ekpobimi2024ryu] The future of software development: integrating AI and machine learning into front-end technologies (2024), introduces a significant new dimension that branches from the previously identified trends. While the initial trends focused on (1) the responsible and structured development of AI systems themselves, and (2) the broadening definition of \"quality\" and \"responsibility\" *within* those AI systems, [ekpobimi2024ryu] shifts the focus to *how AI is used as a tool to develop software*, particularly in front-end technologies. This represents a move from \"AI for Software Development Compliance\" (making AI systems compliant) to \"AI *in* Software Development\" (using AI to build software). However, it extends Trend 2 by explicitly discussing \"ethical considerations such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the responsible use of AI\" in the context of AI-driven front-end development, thereby broadening the scope of \"responsibility\" to include the tools and processes of software development itself.\n\n*   **What new methodological or conceptual shifts appear with these additions?**\n    The most prominent conceptual shift is the recognition of AI as a powerful *enabler and assistant* within the software development lifecycle, leading to the emergence of AI-Assisted Software Engineering (AASE). This expands the role of AI beyond being merely the product under development to also being a transformative agent in the development process. Methodologically, [ekpobimi2024ryu] is a *review paper*, which signifies a stage where the integration of AI into software development is mature enough to warrant comprehensive syntheses of existing applications and observed benefits, rather than just proposing novel methods.\n\n*   **Do the new papers fill gaps identified in the previous synthesis, or do they open entirely new directions?**\n    [ekpobimi2024ryu] primarily *opens an entirely new direction* by focusing on the application of AI *within* the software development process. The previous synthesis did not explicitly cover AI's role as a development tool. However, it also implicitly addresses a gap in the *scope* of \"compliance\" and \"responsibility\" by extending these concerns to the AI-powered tools and methodologies used in software development, not just the characteristics of the final AI product.\n\n*   **Are there connections between new papers and earlier works not previously synthesized?**\n    Yes, there are indirect but important connections:\n    *   **Connection to [golendukhina2022kqe]:** [golendukhina2022kqe] empirically identified internal software quality issues in AI-enabled systems. [ekpobimi2024ryu] discusses AI-powered automated testing and debugging as a key innovation in front-end development, which could serve as a technological solution to mitigate some of the quality problems identified earlier.\n    *   **Connection to [lu2022et0] and [vakkuri2021n6l]:** These papers established the critical need for Responsible AI and ethical considerations. [ekpobimi2024ryu] explicitly brings these ethical concerns (data privacy, algorithmic bias) into the realm of AI-assisted software development, demonstrating that \"responsibility\" is a pervasive concern that applies to both the AI systems being built and the AI tools used to build them.\n\n*   **Does the addition of new papers change the overall narrative or strengthen existing interpretations?**\n    The addition of [ekpobimi2024ryu] significantly *broadens the overall narrative*. The field of \"AI for Software Development Compliance\" is no longer solely about ensuring the AI systems *being built* are compliant and responsible. It now also encompasses the compliance and ethical implications of *using AI to build software*. This introduces a crucial dual challenge: building responsible AI, and building software responsibly *with* AI. It strengthens the existing interpretation that the concept of \"responsibility\" in software engineering is continuously expanding to new dimensions and applications.\n\n**2. Updated Evolution Analysis:**\n\nThe evolution of research in \"AI for Software Development Compliance\" across these seven papers reveals three major, interconnected trends: **Trend 1: The Maturation from Ad-Hoc AI Development to Structured, Lifecycle-Oriented AI Engineering**, **Trend 2: The Broadening Definition of \"Quality\" and \"Responsibility\" in AI Systems to Encompass Ethics, Trustworthiness, and Sustainability**, and **Trend 3: The Emergence of AI-Assisted Software Engineering (AASE) and its Associated Responsibilities.**\n\n*Trend 1: The Maturation from Ad-Hoc AI Development to Structured, Lifecycle-Oriented AI Engineering*\n- *Methodological progression*: This trend begins with an empirical identification of deficiencies in existing AI development processes, moving towards conceptual frameworks and comprehensive roadmaps, and finally grounding these with real-world qualitative data. [haakman2020xky] initiates this by employing an *exploratory single-case study* at a large financial institution. This qualitative approach reveals the practical shortcomings of generic AI lifecycle models. Building on this, [vakkuri2021n6l] proposes a *conceptual framework* for an AI (Ethics) Maturity Model, shifting the focus to a structured, process-improvement methodology. This conceptualization is then significantly advanced by [lu2022et0], which utilizes a *Systematic Literature Review (SLR)* to synthesize existing knowledge into a comprehensive, actionable roadmap. Finally, [golendukhina2022kqe] provides crucial *empirical validation* through semi-structured interviews with AI engineers, offering ground-level insights into the specific quality issues that necessitate these structured engineering approaches.\n- *Problem evolution*: The initial problem, as identified by [haakman2020xky], is the inadequacy of existing AI lifecycle models for regulated environments, leading to overlooked stages like data collection, documentation, monitoring, and risk assessment. This highlights a fundamental *process gap*. [vakkuri2021n6l] then addresses the problem that high-level AI ethics principles lack actionable guidance, arguing that traditional software engineering maturity models are insufficient for AI's unique characteristics. This evolves the problem from mere process gaps to a *lack of structured integration for ethical considerations*. [lu2022et0] tackles the challenge of operationalizing Responsible AI by bridging the gap between abstract principles and isolated algorithmic solutions, aiming to provide concrete, lifecycle-integrated guidance. [golendukhina2022kqe] further grounds these problems by empirically demonstrating that Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is often overlooked in AI development, leading to tangible issues like \"data handling\" problems and poor maintainability, which directly undermine the goals of trustworthiness and compliance.\n- *Key innovations*: [haakman2020xky]'s key innovation is the empirical identification of five critical, overlooked stages in the AI lifecycle, providing a more realistic and compliance-aware process model. [vakkuri2021n6l] innovates by proposing the necessity of an AI-specific maturity model, providing a strategic framework for systematic ethical and quality improvement. The most significant innovation in this trend comes from [lu2022et0], which delivers a holistic, software engineering-centric roadmap for Responsible AI, detailing multi-level governance, process-oriented practices across the SDLC, and Responsible-AI-by-Design principles. This roadmap offers a concrete blueprint for operationalizing complex ethical requirements. [golendukhina2022kqe] contributes by empirically identifying 12 distinct internal quality issues, providing practical insights into *when* and *how* these issues manifest, which is invaluable for refining and validating the proposed engineering practices.\n- *Integration points*: This trend establishes the foundational understanding of *how* to build AI systems responsibly, which provides the context for the expanding definitions of \"responsibility\" in Trend 2 and the ethical considerations in Trend 3.\n\n*Trend 2: The Broadening Definition of \"Quality\" and \"Responsibility\" in AI Systems to Encompass Ethics, Trustworthiness, and Sustainability*\n- *Methodological progression*: This trend starts with a focus on regulatory compliance and risk, then expands to include operational trustworthiness, ethical integration, and finally environmental sustainability. [haakman2020xky] uses a *case study* to highlight the need for processes that ensure *regulatory compliance* and *risk assessment*. [borg20214da] introduces *technical solutions* (FUSE-based CSI driver) and a *conceptual framework* (\"buttresses and rebars\" MLOps) to build *trustworthy and maintainable* AI systems. [vakkuri2021n6l] proposes a *maturity model* to systematically integrate *ethical requirements*. [lu2022et0] synthesizes these into a comprehensive *roadmap* for *Responsible AI*, encompassing a wide array of ethical and quality attributes. Finally, [martnezfernndez2023ipo] proposes an *architecture-centric approach* to integrate *environmental sustainability*, expanding the scope of \"responsibility\" even further.\n- *Problem evolution*: Initially, the problem is framed by [haakman2020xky] as ensuring AI systems meet *regulatory and risk management* requirements in regulated industries. [borg20214da] then addresses the challenge of achieving *operational trustworthiness and maintainability* in agile ML development, particularly in transitioning from prototypes to production-grade systems. [vakkuri2021n6l] identifies the gap in translating abstract *AI ethics principles* into actionable development practices. [lu2022et0] consolidates these by addressing the overarching problem of *operationalizing Responsible AI*, which includes fairness, transparency, privacy, and accountability, across the entire lifecycle. The latest evolution in this trend, presented by [martnezfernndez2023ipo], tackles the significant *energy consumption and environmental footprint* of AI systems, highlighting that current \"red AI\" development neglects \"greenability,\" thus expanding the definition of responsible AI to include ecological impact.\n- *Key innovations*: [borg20214da]'s FUSE-based CSI driver is a technical innovation enabling more robust and trustworthy development environments. Its \"buttresses and rebars\" MLOps metaphor provides a conceptual framework for continuous reinforcement of AI system integrity. [vakkuri2021n6l]'s proposal for an AI (Ethics) Maturity Model is a key innovation for systematically embedding ethical considerations. [lu2022et0]'s comprehensive roadmap for Responsible AI, with its detailed practices for governance, lifecycle integration, and design, is a major contribution for operationalizing a broad set of quality attributes. Finally, [martnezfernndez2023ipo] introduces the novel concept of \"greenability\" as a first-class concern in AI architecture, proposing an AI-specific quality model and architectural patterns to address the environmental impact of AI, thereby significantly broadening the scope of \"AI for Software Development Compliance.\"\n- *Integration points*: This trend defines *what* constitutes a \"compliant\" and \"responsible\" AI system, setting the stage for understanding the ethical implications when AI itself becomes a tool in software development, as explored in Trend 3.\n\n*Trend 3: The Emergence of AI-Assisted Software Engineering (AASE) and its Associated Responsibilities*\n- *Methodological progression*: This new trend is introduced by [ekpobimi2024ryu] (2024), which is a *review paper* synthesizing existing applications and emerging trends of AI/ML integration into front-end development. This methodological approach reflects a shift from proposing novel solutions for AI system development to comprehensively analyzing the impact and applications of AI *as a tool* within the broader software development process.\n- *Problem evolution*: [ekpobimi2024ryu] addresses the limitations of traditional, non-AI/ML approaches in front-end development regarding efficiency (manual coding, testing), personalization (static interfaces), and responsiveness. It highlights the challenge and opportunity of using AI to automate routine tasks, enhance predictive capabilities, and improve user engagement. Crucially, it also identifies *new ethical considerations* (data privacy, algorithmic bias, responsible use of AI) that arise when AI is integrated into the development process itself, extending the problem space of \"responsibility\" beyond the AI product to the AI-powered tools.\n- *Key innovations*: The primary innovation of [ekpobimi2024ryu] is its *comprehensive synthesis* of how diverse AI/ML techniques (e.g., code generation, automated testing/debugging, predictive analytics for personalization, NLP for conversational interfaces, adaptive UIs) are converging to redefine front-end development. It categorizes existing integrations (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Testim, Adobe Sensei) and emerging trends, providing a roadmap for future integration. This paper's contribution is in articulating the technical landscape and the observed benefits of AI-driven automation and intelligence in software creation.\n- *Integration points*: This trend significantly expands the scope of \"AI for Software Development Compliance\" by introducing the ethical and quality implications of *using AI as a development tool*. It connects to Trend 1 by showing how AI can contribute to more structured and efficient development processes (e.g., automated testing, code generation), and directly to Trend 2 by extending the discussion of \"responsibility\" (e.g., algorithmic bias, data privacy) to the AI tools themselves, not just the AI systems they might help create. For example, the need for robust SQA identified by [golendukhina2022kqe] could be partially addressed by the AI-powered testing frameworks discussed in [ekpobimi2024ryu].\n\n**3. Refined Synthesis:**\n\nThe unified intellectual trajectory connecting all seven works now encompasses not only the systematic and responsible engineering of AI systems themselves but also the ethical and quality implications of leveraging AI *as a tool* within the broader software development lifecycle. This expanded view reveals a field continuously grappling with the dual challenge of building compliant and trustworthy AI products, while simultaneously ensuring that the AI-powered tools and processes used to build *all* software are themselves responsible, ethical, and efficient. The collective contribution is to establish a comprehensive framework for \"AI for Software Development Compliance\" that addresses both the product and the process, pushing the boundaries of what constitutes responsible software engineering in the age of AI.",

        "title": "Agility in Software 2.0 - Notebook Interfaces and MLOps with Buttresses and Rebars",
        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence through machine learning is increasingly used in the digital society. Solutions based on machine learning bring both great opportunities, thus coined\"Software 2.0,\"but also great challenges for the engineering community to tackle. Due to the experimental approach used by data scientists when developing machine learning models, agility is an essential characteristic. In this keynote address, we discuss two contemporary development phenomena that are fundamental in machine learning development, i.e., notebook interfaces and MLOps. First, we present a solution that can remedy some of the intrinsic weaknesses of working in notebooks by supporting easy transitions to integrated development environments. Second, we propose reinforced engineering of AI systems by introducing metaphorical buttresses and rebars in the MLOps context. Machine learning-based solutions are dynamic in nature, and we argue that reinforced continuous engineering is required to quality assure the trustworthy AI systems of tomorrow.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n### Technical Paper Analysis: Agility in Software 2.0 { Notebook Interfaces and MLOps with Buttresses and Rebars \\cite{borg20214da}\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** The paper addresses the challenges of achieving agility and ensuring quality in Machine Learning (ML) development, often referred to as \"Software 2.0.\" Specifically, it targets two key issues:\n        *   The intrinsic weaknesses of cloud-based notebook interfaces for developing production-grade ML solutions, particularly the difficulty in transitioning from rapid prototyping to robust software engineering practices (e.g., version control, refactoring, deployment).\n        *   The need for robust, continuous engineering and operationalization of ML systems (MLOps) to ensure trustworthiness and maintainability, especially given the \"Changing Anything Changes Everything\" (CACE) principle in ML.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge:** This problem is critical because ML is increasingly central to digital society, yet data scientists often lack traditional software engineering training. The experimental, iterative nature of ML development (data collection, feature engineering, model selection, etc.) demands extreme agility but often compromises qualities like reproducibility, testability, and traceability, which are essential for trustworthy and maintainable AI systems in production.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:**\n        *   The work positions ML development as requiring \"agility on steroids\" compared to conventional agile software development and DevOps.\n        *   It acknowledges the widespread use and benefits of notebook interfaces (e.g., Jupyter, Databricks) for rapid experimentation and literate computing, building on Knuth's literate programming paradigm.\n        *   It draws parallels between MLOps and DevOps, extending the concept of continuous engineering to the unique challenges of ML systems.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n        *   **Notebook Interfaces:** Current notebook interfaces, while agile, suffer from pain points like limited support for code refactoring, difficult deployment to production, poor history exploration, and challenges with long-running tasks \\cite{borg20214da}. They often lack the robust tooling (version control, static analysis, linting) available in Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).\n        *   **ML Development Lifecycle:** Many organizations struggle to transition ML proofs-of-concept into production-quality AI systems due to a lack of focus on the holistic lifecycle, continuous monitoring, and adaptation to phenomena like distributional shifts \\cite{borg20214da}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method/Algorithm:** The paper presents two main technical thrusts:\n        *   **Bridging Notebooks and IDEs:** It introduces a solution (developed by Jakobsson and Henriksson) that enables seamless movement between cloud-based notebook interfaces and local IDEs. This is achieved through a custom **networked file system implemented using File System in Userspace (FUSE)**, which is exposed to Kubernetes clusters as a **Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver** \\cite{borg20214da}. This allows remote notebook environments (specifically, Cowait Notebooks running JupyterLab in a Cowait task) to access local files on a data scientist's machine.\n        *   **Reinforced MLOps (\"Buttresses and Rebars\"):** It proposes a conceptual framework for \"reinforced continuous engineering\" of AI systems. This involves adopting MLOps as an engineering discipline that combines ML, DevOps, and Data Engineering practices to standardize and streamline the entire ML lifecycle. The metaphors of \"buttresses\" (external support) and \"rebars\" (internal reinforcement) emphasize the need for robust, continuous processes and infrastructure to build trustworthy and resilient AI systems.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:**\n        *   The FUSE-based CSI driver for local-remote file sharing in ML environments is a novel technical approach to address the notebook-IDE gap, contrasting with solutions where both code and data are local (Jupyter) or where remote execution lacks local data access (Databricks) \\cite{borg20214da}.\n        *   The \"buttresses and rebars\" metaphor provides a fresh perspective on MLOps, highlighting the structural integrity and continuous reinforcement required for AI systems, especially in the context of regulatory demands for trustworthy AI.\n        *   The use of **Cowait**, an open-source framework for simplified container orchestration on Kubernetes, as the underlying platform for running notebook interfaces and distributed ML workflows, is also a key enabler for the proposed solution.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations:**\n        *   A novel architecture for integrating local IDEs with remote, cloud-based notebook environments via a custom networked file system (FUSE) exposed through a Kubernetes CSI driver \\cite{borg20214da}.\n        *   Leveraging the Cowait framework to containerize and orchestrate JupyterLab as \"Cowait Notebooks,\" enabling distributed execution of ML tasks directly from notebook cells.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis:**\n        *   The conceptualization of \"reinforced continuous engineering\" for AI systems, using the \"buttresses and rebars\" metaphor, to address the inherent dynamism and CACE principle of ML development and operations \\cite{borg20214da}.\n        *   An emphasis on MLOps as a holistic discipline for achieving trustworthy AI, extending beyond mere automation to encompass continuous monitoring, evolution, and quality assurance throughout the ML lifecycle.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted (for the notebook-IDE bridging solution):** Jakobsson and Henriksson conducted two studies:\n        *   **Quantitative Performance Study:** Evaluated the solution's file access performance under varying numbers of files, file sizes, and network conditions \\cite{borg20214da}.\n        *   **Qualitative Utility Study:** Recruited data scientists and ML-experienced software developers to perform a programming task using a think-aloud protocol to gather feedback on the solution's utility and user experience \\cite{borg20214da}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results:**\n        *   **Quantitative:** The solution satisfied the requirement of file access within 1 second for reasonable file sizes and realistic network latency, aligning with human response time expectations \\cite{borg20214da}.\n        *   **Qualitative:** Feedback was mixed. Data scientists comfortable with managed cloud solutions expressed hesitation due to perceived reduced ease-of-use and potential collaboration issues. Developers with a software engineering background were more positive, appreciating the ability to use familiar local IDE tooling \\cite{borg20214da}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:**\n        *   The FUSE-based file sharing solution is a proof-of-concept, and while performance was acceptable, user feedback indicated a need for further refinement to address ease-of-use and collaboration concerns for some user groups \\cite{borg20214da}.\n        *   The MLOps \"buttresses and rebars\" concept is primarily a high-level framework and vision, with the paper not detailing specific novel algorithms or implementations for this part beyond advocating for existing MLOps practices.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The notebook-IDE bridging solution is specifically designed for environments leveraging Kubernetes for container orchestration and Python-based ML workflows (via Cowait and JupyterLab). The MLOps framework is broadly applicable to any organization developing and deploying ML systems.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:**\n        *   Provides a concrete, technically innovative solution (FUSE-based CSI driver) to a long-standing pain point in ML development workflows: the disconnect between rapid prototyping in notebooks and robust engineering in IDEs \\cite{borg20214da}. This directly enhances developer agility and productivity in distributed ML environments.\n        *   Elevates the discussion around MLOps from a set of tools or practices to a strategic imperative for \"reinforced continuous engineering\" of trustworthy AI, linking it to critical aspects like regulatory compliance (e.g., EU AI Act) and the inherent challenges of ML system evolution \\cite{borg20214da}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:**\n        *   The FUSE/CSI solution opens avenues for further research into seamless local-remote development environments for ML, exploring alternative file sharing mechanisms, user experience improvements, and integration with diverse ML frameworks.\n        *   The \"buttresses and rebars\" concept can inspire research into novel architectural patterns, automated quality assurance mechanisms, and governance frameworks that explicitly address the continuous reinforcement and trustworthiness of AI systems throughout their lifecycle.\n        *   It highlights the need for interdisciplinary research bridging software engineering, data science, and operations to build more resilient and accountable AI solutions.",

To address this challenge, we propose a maturity model for ensuring trustworthy and reliable AI software, known as AI-MM, by considering common AI processes and fairness-specific processes within a traditional maturity model, SPICE (ISO/IEC 15504).

A common observation is that although software systems are deterministic and you can build and test to a specification, AI-enabled systems, in particular those that include ML components, are generally probabilistic. Systems with ML components can have a high margin of error due to the uncertainty that often follows predictive algorithms. The margin of error can be related to the inability to predict the result in advance or the same result cannot be reproduced.

        "title": "Time for AI (Ethics) Maturity Model Is Now",
        "abstract": "There appears to be a common agreement that ethical concerns are of high importance when it comes to systems equipped with some sort of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Demands for ethical AI are declared from all directions. As a response, in recent years, public bodies, governments, and universities have rushed in to provide a set of principles to be considered when AI based systems are designed and used. We have learned, however, that high-level principles do not turn easily into actionable advice for practitioners. Hence, also companies are publishing their own ethical guidelines to guide their AI development. This paper argues that AI software is still software and needs to be approached from the software development perspective. The software engineering paradigm has introduced maturity model thinking, which provides a roadmap for companies to improve their performance from the selected viewpoints known as the key capabilities. We want to voice out a call for action for the development of a maturity model for AI software. We wish to discuss whether the focus should be on AI ethics or, more broadly, the quality of an AI system, called a maturity model for the development of AI systems.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review, emphasizing technical innovations and empirical validation:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Problem**: High-level AI ethics principles and guidelines, despite their proliferation, fail to translate into actionable advice for practitioners, leading to a significant gap between ethical aspirations and practical AI software development \\cite{vakkuri2021n6l}. Existing guidelines lack standardization, suffer from low industry adoption, and do not provide concrete \"how-to\" guidance.\n    *   **Motivation**: With AI systems becoming pervasive and impacting critical decision-making (e.g., healthcare, transportation), there is an urgent need for systematic guidance to ensure the development of ethically sound AI. The authors argue that AI software, being software, can benefit from the structured improvement approach of maturity models, which have proven effective in traditional software engineering \\cite{vakkuri2021n6l}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches**: Numerous organizations have published AI ethics principles and guidelines (e.g., IEEE, EU Commission). Some AI-specific process models exist (e.g., Microsoft nine-step pipeline, \"stairway to heaven\" AI model). Traditional software engineering maturity models (e.g., CMMI, SAFe) are widely used.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   AI ethics guidelines are abstract, provide \"what\" but not \"how,\" and have shown limited impact on industry practices \\cite{vakkuri2021n6l}. A survey by the authors found that these guidelines had not notably affected industry practices \\cite{vakkuri2021n6l}.\n        *   Existing AI-specific models are not primarily focused on the *quality or ethical aspects* of AI systems and lack generality for diverse organizational contexts, including SMEs and startups \\cite{vakkuri2021n6l}.\n        *   Traditional software maturity models are insufficient because AI systems possess unique characteristics: they are probabilistic (not deterministic), learn from data, have quality attributes that change during experimentation, and ethical requirements (fairness, trustworthiness, transparency, explainability) have distinct meanings in the AI context that are not adequately addressed by existing models \\cite{vakkuri2021n6l}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper *proposes* and advocates for the development of a **maturity model** specifically designed for AI software development, which could focus either on AI ethics (AI Ethics Maturity Model) or broader AI system quality (AI Maturity Model) \\cite{vakkuri2021n6l}. This is a conceptual proposal for a new framework type.\n    *   **Novelty**: The innovation lies in identifying the critical need for such a specialized maturity model, explicitly detailing why existing SE and AI-specific models are inadequate for integrating ethical considerations and unique AI quality attributes. It positions a maturity model as a structured, actionable roadmap to bridge the research-practice gap in ethical AI development \\cite{vakkuri2021n6l}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Conceptual Framework**: Articulation of the foundational argument for a process-oriented maturity model to systematically integrate ethical requirements and quality attributes throughout the AI system development lifecycle \\cite{vakkuri2021n6l}.\n    *   **Identification of Unique AI Challenges**: Detailed analysis highlighting the specific technical and ethical characteristics of AI systems (e.g., probabilistic nature, data-centricity, evolving quality attributes, unique interpretations of fairness and transparency) that necessitate a distinct maturity model, differentiating it from traditional software engineering \\cite{vakkuri2021n6l}.\n    *   **Call to Action**: A clear proposal for the research and industry communities to collaborate on devising a generic AI (ethics) maturity model to benchmark, standardize, and disseminate best practices for ethical AI engineering \\cite{vakkuri2021n6l}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   This paper *does not present new experimental validation* of a proposed maturity model.\n    *   It *references prior empirical work* by the authors to motivate the problem: a survey of 211 companies (106 developing AI products) revealed mixed levels of maturity in implementing AI ethics and confirmed that existing AI ethics guidelines had not significantly impacted industry practices \\cite{vakkuri2021n6l}. This serves as empirical evidence for the problem statement rather than validation of a solution.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**: The paper is a conceptual proposal and a call to action; it does not present a fully developed maturity model, its specific stages, key process areas, or implementation details.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The envisioned maturity model is intended to be generic and applicable across various organizations, including SMEs and startups, to standardize and promote proper engineering practices for integrating ethical requirements into AI development \\cite{vakkuri2021n6l}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art**: By rigorously outlining the shortcomings of current approaches and articulating the unique technical and ethical demands of AI, the paper significantly advances the discourse towards a more structured, engineering-centric paradigm for ethical AI development \\cite{vakkuri2021n6l}.\n    *   **Potential Impact**: It provides a strong conceptual foundation and a clear direction for future research and development of practical, actionable frameworks (maturity models) that can bridge the gap between abstract ethical principles and concrete AI development practices. This could lead to more consistent, trustworthy, and ethically sound AI systems across diverse industries \\cite{vakkuri2021n6l}.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, AI-based systems have achieved outstanding results and have outperformed humans in different domains. However, the processes of training AI models and inferring from them require high computational resources, which pose a significant challenge in the current energy efficiency societal demand. To cope with this challenge, this research project paper describes the main vision, goals, and expected outcomes of the GAISSA project. The GAISSA project aims at providing data scientists and software engineers tool-supported, architecture-centric methods for the modelling and development of green AI-based systems. Although the project is in an initial stage, we describe the current research results, which illustrate the potential to achieve GAISSA objectives.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \"Towards green AI-based software systems: an architecture-centric approach (GAISSA)\" \\cite{martnezfernndez2023ipo} for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the significant energy consumption and environmental footprint of AI-based systems, particularly during model training and inference, which stems from the high computational resources required by large AI models and data volumes.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: This problem is critical due to increasing societal demand for energy efficiency, stringent environmental regulations (e.g., EU targets for GHG emission reductions), and the dramatic growth in computing resources used for AI (e.g., 300,000x increase in DL training compute in 6 years). Current AI development primarily targets accuracy (\"red AI\"), often disregarding energy costs, leading to substantial carbon footprints (e.g., training one large ML model for autonomous vehicles equivalent to 242,231 miles driven by a passenger vehicle). The challenge lies in integrating energy efficiency (\"greenability\") into the design and development of AI systems, which current architecture-centric methods largely overlook.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: The work builds upon existing research in software sustainability, quality models for general software (e.g., ISO/IEC 25010 extensions with \"greenability,\" GREENSOFT model), and some initial efforts in energy-efficient AI models and architectural/design patterns for sustainability. It also acknowledges existing tools for general software energy profiling and cloud carbon footprint dashboards.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   Existing software sustainability quality models do not specifically address the unique characteristics and lifecycle phases (data collection, model training, optimization) of AI-based systems.\n        *   Current approaches for energy-efficient AI models from an architectural perspective are scarce, ad-hoc, and lack transferability.\n        *   Architectural and design patterns for general software sustainability do not consider AI-based systems, and conversely, patterns for AI-based systems do not address greenability.\n        *   No current tool comprehensively supports the modelling and development cycles of AI-based systems from an energy efficiency-aware perspective, offering assessments, estimations, and what-if analysis for AI-specific choices (libraries, training, deployment architectures).\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The GAISSA project proposes an **architecture-centric approach** to provide data scientists and software engineers with tool-supported methods for the modelling and development of green AI-based systems. It focuses on understanding, defining, reporting, and managing the energy efficiency impact of architectural decisions throughout the AI engineering lifecycle, specifically during the Modelling and Development stages.\n    *   **Novelty**: The approach is novel by systematically integrating \"greenability\" as a first-class concern into the architectural design and development of AI-based systems. This involves:\n        *   Developing an AI-specific quality model for greenability.\n        *   Creating predictive models to understand how AI model design decisions affect energy efficiency.\n        *   Defining architecture and design patterns tailored for building green AI-based systems.\n        *   Developing analytic tools for greenability-driven analysis, decision-making, and reporting, including what-if analysis for different AI alternatives.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms, Methods, or Techniques**:\n        *   **O1: Quality Model for Greenability of AI-based Systems**: A hierarchical structure of greenability-related quality factors, operationalized metrics, and understanding of synergies/conflicts with other qualities (e.g., accuracy, privacy).\n        *   **O2: Architecture-centric Methods for Green AI Model Training & Deployment**: Predictive models to guide sustainability-aware AI model training and context-aware measurement methods for AI platform energy consumption.\n        *   **O3: Architecture-centric Methods for Green AI-based System Development**: Identification of architectural concerns driving green design and a catalogue of architecture and design patterns for building green AI-based systems, detailing their forces and interactions.\n    *   **System Design or Architectural Innovations**: The project aims to provide a framework and catalogue of patterns that explicitly link architectural decisions to greenability outcomes in AI systems, moving beyond ad-hoc solutions.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights or Analysis**: The project hypothesizes that a better understanding and management of architectural decisions' impact on energy efficiency is crucial for delivering less computationally demanding AI-based systems.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   The paper states that the GAISSA project is in an initial stage. While it mentions \"current research results, which illustrate the potential to achieve GAISSA objectives,\" it explicitly notes, \"Due to space limitations, we only summarize the initial results of GAISSA. The interested reader is referred to [29] for a detailed description of the initial results.\"\n    *   Therefore, this paper *does not present detailed experimental validation or key performance metrics and comparison results itself*. It indicates that initial results include a first version of the quality model for greenability (O1) and a first version of a catalogue of architecture and design patterns for green AI-based systems (O3), with full details available in a separate publication.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The project is in its initial stages, and the full implementation and evaluation of all proposed objectives are ongoing. The paper does not detail specific technical limitations of the proposed methods themselves, but rather highlights the current gaps in the field.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: GAISSA focuses specifically on the **Modelling** (AI model training) and **Development** (AI model integration into software, system deployment) stages of the AI engineering lifecycle, acknowledging that these stages present unique challenges beyond traditional software engineering. It does not explicitly cover Data Management or Operation stages in detail within its current scope.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: GAISSA advances the technical state-of-the-art by proposing a comprehensive, systematic, and architecture-centric approach to address the energy efficiency of AI-based systems. It moves beyond general software sustainability to tackle the unique challenges of AI, aiming to provide concrete methods, models, patterns, and tools where current solutions are fragmented or non-existent.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: The project has the potential to significantly impact future research by:\n        *   Establishing a foundational quality model and metrics for greenability in AI.\n        *   Guiding the development of energy-efficient AI models and platforms through predictive and context-aware methods.\n        *   Providing a catalogue of architectural and design patterns to foster the creation of greener AI-based systems.\n        *   Developing analytic tools that enable greenability-driven decision-making, fostering a shift from \"red AI\" to \"green AI\" practices in industry and academia.",

Intelligent systems are replacing and cooperating with traditional software components. Thus, the same development processes and standards in software engineering ought to be complied in artificial intelligence systems. This study aims to understand the processes by which artificial intelligence-based systems are developed and how state-of-the-art lifecycle models fit the current needs of the industry. We conducted an exploratory case study at ING, a global bank with a strong European base. We interviewed 17 people with different roles and from different departments within the organization. We have found that the following stages have been overlooked by previous lifecycle models: data collection, feasibility study, documentation, model monitoring, and model risk assessment. Our work shows that the real challenges of applying Machine Learning go much beyond sophisticated learning algorithms – more focus is needed on the entire lifecycle. In particular, regardless of the existing development tools for Machine Learning, we observe that they are still not meeting the particularities of this field.",
        "summary": "Here is a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review, adhering to your requirements:\n\n*   **CITATION REQUIREMENTS**: Always use \"\\cite{haakman2020xky}\" when referencing this paper.\n\n---\n\n**1. Research Problem & Motivation**\n*   **Problem**: Existing Artificial Intelligence (AI) lifecycle models (e.g., CRISP-DM, TDSP) are inadequate for the current needs of the industry, particularly in heavily-regulated domains like fintech \\cite{haakman2020xky}. As intelligent systems integrate with traditional software, they must comply with the same rigorous software engineering development processes and standards.\n*   **Motivation**: There is a critical need to understand the real-world processes of AI system development and to identify deficiencies in state-of-the-art lifecycle models when applied in complex, regulated environments. The paper argues that the challenges of applying Machine Learning (ML) extend beyond sophisticated algorithms, requiring a holistic focus on the entire lifecycle, especially for organizations undergoing digital transformation to embrace AI \\cite{haakman2020xky}.\n\n**2. Related Work & Positioning**\n*   **Existing Approaches**: The paper reviews prominent ML lifecycle models (CRISP-DM \\cite{chapman2000crisp}, TDSP \\cite{microsoft2017team}, and Microsoft's ML workflow \\cite{amershi2019software}) and discusses related industry case studies (e.g., Microsoft, Booking.com, Twitter) and research on ML-specific software engineering challenges (e.g., technical debt, production readiness, experiment management) \\cite{haakman2020xky}.\n*   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n    *   Existing lifecycle models do not adequately address the unique challenges of AI systems operating under heavy regulations, such as those prevalent in the fintech industry \\cite{haakman2020xky}.\n    *   Previous industry studies often focused on organizations with established ML practices (e.g., Microsoft) or did not define formal lifecycle models (e.g., Booking.com), potentially overlooking the specific challenges faced by organizations *transitioning* to AI or those in highly regulated sectors.\n    *   There was a recognized gap in understanding the post-evaluation stages of the ML lifecycle, such as deployment and monitoring, which this study aims to extend beyond prior work \\cite{haakman2020xky}.\n\n**3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n*   **Core Technical Method/Algorithm**: This paper does not propose a new technical algorithm. Instead, its core method is an *exploratory single-case study methodology* \\cite{haakman2020xky}. It involved conducting semi-structured interviews with 17 participants from diverse roles and departments within ING, a global bank, and triangulating this data with other organizational resources. The goal was to empirically identify gaps and challenges in existing AI lifecycle models.\n*   **Novelty/Difference**: The approach is novel due to its specific focus on the *fintech domain*, which introduces unique regulatory and compliance challenges not fully addressed by generic ML lifecycle models. By studying an organization undergoing a significant digital transformation to integrate AI at scale, the research provides empirical insights into the practical deficiencies of current practices, leading to the identification of previously overlooked, yet critical, stages in the AI lifecycle \\cite{haakman2020xky}.\n\n**4. Key Technical Contributions**\n*   **Novel Algorithms, Methods, or Techniques**: The study identifies and highlights critical, previously overlooked stages essential for robust AI system development, particularly in regulated environments. These stages are:\n    *   `Data Collection` (emphasizing its complexity beyond simple acquisition).\n    *   `Feasibility Study` (for early assessment of business value and technical viability).\n    *   `Documentation` (for transparency, auditability, and maintenance).\n    *   `Model Monitoring` (for continuous performance and drift detection post-deployment).\n    *   `Model Risk Assessment` (for evaluating regulatory, ethical, and operational risks) \\cite{haakman2020xky}.\n*   **System Design or Architectural Innovations**: The findings implicitly contribute to future system design by underscoring the need for architectural considerations that support these overlooked stages, such as robust data governance, automated documentation generation, and integrated monitoring and risk assessment frameworks for AI systems.\n*   **Theoretical Insights or Analysis**: The paper provides empirical evidence that the real challenges of applying Machine Learning extend significantly beyond sophisticated learning algorithms, necessitating a holistic focus on the entire AI lifecycle. It refines existing lifecycle models (CRISP-DM and TDSP) by integrating these newly identified stages, offering a more comprehensive framework for AI engineering in regulated industries \\cite{haakman2020xky}.\n\n**5. Experimental Validation**\n*   **Experiments Conducted**: An exploratory single-case study was performed at ING, a global bank with a strong focus on fintech and AI professionalization. Data was primarily collected through semi-structured interviews with 17 participants from various roles and departments (e.g., IT Engineers, Product Managers, Data Scientists). This interview data was triangulated with other internal organizational resources \\cite{haakman2020xky}. Data saturation was used as a stopping criterion for interviews.\n*   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n    *   The study's \"performance\" is measured by its success in *identifying critical gaps* in existing ML lifecycle models and *unveiling specific challenges* in developing ML applications at scale within a fintech context.\n    *   The key finding is that `data collection`, `feasibility study`, `documentation`, `model monitoring`, and `model risk assessment` are consistently overlooked by previous lifecycle models \\cite{haakman2020xky}.\n    *   The research highlighted a significant lack of standards and a strong need for automation in the documentation and governance of ML models.\n    *   These findings implicitly compare observed industry practices against the theoretical stages of CRISP-DM, TDSP, and Amershi et al.'s model, demonstrating their practical deficiencies in a real-world, regulated environment \\cite{haakman2020xky}.\n\n**6. Limitations & Scope**\n*   **Technical Limitations or Assumptions**: As a single-case exploratory study at one organization (ING), the findings, while rich, may not be universally generalizable to all fintech organizations or other industries without further validation \\cite{haakman2020xky}. The reliance on self-reported interview data introduces potential for recall bias or subjective interpretation.\n*   **Scope of Applicability**: The findings are most applicable to large, heavily-regulated organizations in the fintech domain that are undergoing digital transformation to integrate AI at scale. While some insights may extend to other industries, the emphasis on regulatory compliance and risk assessment is highly specific to financial services. The study focuses specifically on Machine Learning as a branch of AI \\cite{haakman2020xky}.\n\n**7. Technical Significance**\n*   **Advance State-of-the-Art**: This paper significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in AI Engineering by empirically identifying crucial, often neglected, stages in the AI lifecycle that are vital for the successful, compliant, and robust deployment of ML systems in regulated industries \\cite{haakman2020xky}. It shifts the focus from purely algorithmic advancements to the comprehensive engineering, governance, and operational aspects of AI systems.\n*   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n    *   It paves the way for future research into developing standardized processes, tools, and automation for the newly identified stages: `data collection`, `feasibility studies`, `documentation`, `model monitoring`, and `model risk assessment` in AI systems \\cite{haakman2020xky}.\n    *   It highlights the need for interdisciplinary research combining software engineering, data science, and regulatory compliance.\n    *   The findings can inform and shape the education of AI practitioners, emphasizing a broader skillset beyond just model development.\n    *   It encourages the development of new lifecycle models or significant revisions to existing ones that explicitly incorporate these identified stages, especially for critical, regulated applications.",

        "abstract": "This paper identifies and tackles the challenges of the requirements engineering discipline when applied to development of AI-based complex systems. Due to their complex behaviour, there is an immanent need for a tailored development process for such systems. However, there is still no widely used and specifically tailored process in place to effectively and efficiently deal with requirements suitable for specifying a software solution that uses machine learning. By analysing the related work from software engineering and artificial intelligence fields, potential contributions have been recognized from agent-based software engineering and goal-oriented requirements engineering research, as well as examples from large product development companies. The challenges have been discussed, with proposals given how and when to tackle them. RE4AI taxonomy has also been outlined, to inform the tailoring of development process.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **1. Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** The paper addresses the significant challenges in applying Requirements Engineering (RE) principles and practices to the development of AI-based complex systems, particularly those leveraging machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) \\cite{belani20194yc}. There is a lack of a widely used and specifically tailored development process to effectively manage requirements for such systems.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge:** AI is rapidly growing, but its widespread adoption in complex and dependable systems is hindered by enormous, often underestimated, challenges. The inherent complex behavior of AI systems necessitates a specialized development process, as traditional RE approaches struggle with aspects like the \"black-box\" nature of ML models, data dependencies, and the dynamic evolution of AI components \\cite{belani20194yc}.\n\n*   **2. Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** The work analyzes existing literature from software engineering (SE) and artificial intelligence (AI) fields, identifying potential contributions from agent-based software engineering (ABSE) and goal-oriented requirements engineering (GORE) \\cite{belani20194yc}. It also draws insights from the AI development practices of large product companies, categorizing AI development into requirement-driven, outcome/data-driven, and AI-driven approaches \\cite{belani20194yc}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:** Existing software development paradigms often lack explicit mechanisms for autonomous systems \\cite{belani20194yc}. Traditional SE processes struggle to maintain traceability and perform impact analysis when ML subsystems are treated as \"black-box\" elements. There's a recognized gap in expertise between AI and SE practitioners, and a lack of goal modeling approaches specifically tailored for AI systems that view ML subsystems as goal-seeking entities \\cite{belani20194yc}.\n\n*   **3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper's core approach is the conceptualization and outlining of the **RE4AI taxonomy** \\cite{belani20194yc}. This taxonomy provides a structured framework that maps AI-related entities (data, model, system) to typical RE activities (elicitation, analysis, specification, validation, management, documentation).\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:** The RE4AI taxonomy is novel in its explicit alignment of AI-specific challenges with traditional RE activities and AI system components \\cite{belani20194yc}. It offers a systematic way to identify *when* and *how* to tackle these challenges throughout the software product lifecycle, aiming to inform the tailoring of AI development processes. The paper also highlights the potential of GORE to address the goal-seeking nature of AI components \\cite{belani20194yc}.\n\n*   **4. Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms, Methods, or Techniques:** The primary contribution is the **RE4AI taxonomy outline** itself, which serves as a conceptual tool for organizing and addressing RE challenges in AI development \\cite{belani20194yc}. It's a structured classification rather than a new algorithm.\n    *   **System Design or Architectural Innovations:** The paper identifies and discusses critical system-level design anti-patterns prevalent in AI systems, such as \"glue code,\" \"pipeline jungles,\" \"dead experimental code paths,\" and \"configuration debt,\" which contribute to technical debt \\cite{belani20194yc}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights or Analysis:** It provides a detailed analysis of ML-specific risk factors, including \"entanglement\" (the CACE – Changing Anything Changes Everything – principle), \"undeclared consumers,\" and various \"data dependencies\" (unstable, underutilized, difficult to track, causing correction cascades) \\cite{belani20194yc}. This analysis frames these issues within the context of technical debt, offering a valuable perspective for managing AI system complexity.\n\n*   **5. Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** The paper does *not* present new experimental validation. It is a conceptual and analytical paper that synthesizes findings from existing literature, industry observations, and informal analysis of related work \\cite{belani20194yc}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results:** Not applicable, as no original experiments were conducted or reported. The paper references studies that performed interviews and surveys to identify challenges, but it does not perform its own empirical validation.\n\n*   **6. Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations or Assumptions:** The RE4AI taxonomy is presented as an \"outline\" and requires further refinement and validation \\cite{belani20194yc}. The applicability of existing GORE frameworks and methods to AI systems needs deeper analysis. The paper's analysis of related work is described as \"informally looked into\" \\cite{belani20194yc}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The work primarily focuses on AI-based complex systems, specifically those incorporating machine learning and deep learning components \\cite{belani20194yc}. It highlights potential applicability to domains like healthcare, where challenges such as imbalanced datasets and unsafe failure modes are critical \\cite{belani20194yc}.\n\n*   **7. Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advance State-of-the-Art:** The paper significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing a structured, comprehensive framework (RE4AI taxonomy) for understanding and categorizing the unique requirements engineering challenges in AI-based complex systems \\cite{belani20194yc}. It bridges the gap between traditional RE and the specific demands of AI development, offering a roadmap for practitioners and researchers.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:** The RE4AI taxonomy can inform the tailoring of AI development processes and guide future research into specific RE activities for AI \\cite{belani20194yc}. It explicitly suggests GORE as a promising area for further investigation to model ML subsystems as goal-seeking entities. The paper also calls for detailed exploration of new system design paradigms (e.g., Data-driven and Model-based Design - DMD) in conjunction with the RE4AI taxonomy, and highlights critical \"skill,\" \"data,\" and \"engineering\" gaps that require future attention \\cite{belani20194yc}.",

        "title": "Towards a Roadmap on Software Engineering for Responsible AI",
        "abstract": "Although AI is transforming the world, there are serious concerns about its ability to behave and make decisions responsibly. Many ethical regulations, principles, and frameworks for responsible AI have been issued recently. However, they are high level and difficult to put into practice. On the other hand, most AI researchers focus on algorithmic solutions, while the responsible AI challenges actually crosscut the entire engineering lifecycle and components of AI systems. To close the gap in operationalizing responsible AI, this paper aims to develop a roadmap on software engineering for responsible AI. The roadmap focuses on (i) establishing multi-level governance for responsible AI systems, (ii) setting up the development processes incorporating process-oriented practices for responsible AI systems, and (iii) building responsible-AI-by-design into AI systems through system-level architectural style, patterns and techniques. CCS CONCEPTS • Software and its engineering;",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **CITATION**: \\cite{lu2022et0}\n\n### 1. Research Problem & Motivation\n\n*   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the critical challenge of operationalizing Responsible AI (RAI) in practice. While numerous high-level ethical principles and frameworks for AI exist, they lack concrete, actionable guidance for software engineers to design, implement, and track RAI requirements throughout the entire AI system lifecycle.\n*   **Importance and Challenge**: This problem is important because AI systems are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains, raising serious concerns about their ethical behavior and decision-making. It is challenging because current AI research often focuses on isolated algorithmic solutions (e.g., for fairness or privacy) without integrating them into a holistic software engineering process, and the ethical principles themselves are abstract, making their translation into verifiable technical requirements difficult. The problem crosscuts the entire engineering lifecycle and components of AI systems, requiring a systemic approach beyond just algorithms \\cite{lu2022et0}.\n\n### 2. Related Work & Positioning\n\n*   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: \\cite{lu2022et0} positions its work as a bridge between high-level ethical principles and low-level algorithmic solutions. It acknowledges the existence of many ethical principle frameworks and some algorithm-level mechanisms (e.g., for privacy and fairness).\n*   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n    *   **High-level Principles**: Existing ethical principles are too abstract and do not provide operationalized guidance or software engineering methods for developing responsible AI systems. They leave unanswered questions about how to design for, implement, and track these principles.\n    *   **Algorithmic Focus**: Most AI research on ethics focuses on algorithm-level mechanisms, which often address only a small subset of ethical principles (e.g., privacy, fairness) and rely on theoretical heuristics. These solutions lack linkage to the broader software development processes, including requirements engineering, system design, and operations \\cite{lu2022et0}.\n\n### 3. Technical Approach & Innovation\n\n*   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes a research roadmap on software engineering for operationalizing Responsible AI, developed through a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of 159 primary studies. The roadmap is structured around three key perspectives:\n    1.  **Multi-level Governance**: Establishing governance structures and processes at industry, organization, and team levels to ensure compliance with ethical regulations.\n    2.  **Process-Oriented Practices**: Integrating responsible AI considerations into the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC), including requirements engineering, design, implementation, verification & validation, and operation.\n    3.  **Responsible-AI-by-Design**: Building responsible AI into systems through system-level architectural styles, patterns, and techniques \\cite{lu2022et0}.\n*   **Novelty/Difference**: The novelty lies in its holistic, software engineering-centric approach to Responsible AI. Instead of proposing new algorithms or abstract principles, \\cite{lu2022et0} systematically synthesizes and structures existing and emerging software engineering practices into a comprehensive roadmap. It emphasizes integrating ethical considerations across the entire AI system lifecycle and at multiple organizational levels, moving beyond isolated technical fixes to a systemic engineering discipline \\cite{lu2022et0}.\n\n### 4. Key Technical Contributions\n\n*   **Novel Methods/Techniques**:\n    *   **Multi-level Governance Framework**: Proposes a structured governance framework (industry, organization, team) with concrete mechanisms (e.g., agile regulatory sandboxes, AI capability maturity models, ethical certification, ethics committees, ethical risk assessment checklists, role-level accountability, diverse teams, continuous documentation) \\cite{lu2022et0}.\n    *   **Lifecycle-Integrated Process Practices**: Identifies and organizes specific software engineering practices for each stage of the AI system lifecycle to embed responsible AI:\n        *   **Requirements Engineering**: Ethical user stories, classifying ethical principles into non-functional requirements, verifiable ethical requirements.\n        *   **Design**: Architectural styles/patterns for ethics, value-sensitive design, ethical scenario simulation, XAI UX.\n        *   **Implementation**: Ethical coding standards/checklists, continuous documentation, ethical code review, ethical compliance checking for APIs.\n        *   **Verification & Validation**: Ethical acceptance tests, data tests, formal verification, assurance cases, ethical scoring (AI quotient).\n        *   **Operation**: Phased deployment, continuous monitoring of outcomes, dynamic ethical risk assessment, co-versioning of data/model/code, accountability mechanisms (bill of materials, audit trails) \\cite{lu2022et0}.\n    *   **Responsible-AI-by-Design Principles**: Advocates for embedding ethical considerations directly into the system architecture and design through patterns and techniques.\n*   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: While not proposing a specific architecture, the roadmap highlights the need for architectural styles and patterns that support responsible AI, such as those enabling transparency, explainability, and human control. It also points to decentralized infrastructure for verifiable ethical credentials \\cite{lu2022et0}.\n*   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: The paper's primary theoretical contribution is the systematic synthesis of a comprehensive roadmap, providing a structured way to think about and implement Responsible AI from a software engineering perspective. It identifies the critical gaps between high-level principles and practical implementation, offering a framework to bridge this divide.\n\n### 5. Experimental Validation\n\n*   **Experiments Conducted**: The paper itself does not present experimental validation of a proposed technical solution. Instead, its foundation is a **Systematic Literature Review (SLR)**. The SLR involved:\n    *   Defining two research questions: 1) What responsible AI principles are addressed? 2) What solutions for responsible AI can be identified?\n    *   Searching five major digital libraries (ACM, IEEE, Science Direct, Springer Link, Google Scholar).\n    *   Identifying 159 primary studies that presented concrete solutions for responsible AI (excluding high-level frameworks) \\cite{lu2022et0}.\n*   **Key Performance Metrics/Comparison Results**: As a roadmap paper based on an SLR, it does not report performance metrics or comparative results of a new system. The \"results\" are the synthesized current state, identified challenges, and the proposed roadmap itself, derived from the analysis of the 159 primary studies.\n\n### 6. Limitations & Scope\n\n*   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**:\n    *   The roadmap is a *proposal* for future research and development, not a fully implemented or validated system. Its effectiveness would need to be empirically tested in real-world AI development contexts.\n    *   The SLR, while systematic, is a snapshot of existing literature up to March 2022 and may not capture all emerging practices.\n    *   The paper focuses on the software engineering perspective, acknowledging that Responsible AI is multidisciplinary but positioning SE as the key driver. This implies that non-SE aspects (e.g., purely legal, philosophical, or sociological) are considered primarily through their implications for engineering.\n*   **Scope of Applicability**: The roadmap is broadly applicable to the development of any AI system where ethical considerations are paramount. It aims to provide guidance for governments, organizations, and development teams involved in the AI lifecycle \\cite{lu2022et0}.\n\n### 7. Technical Significance\n\n*   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: \\cite{lu2022et0} significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing the first comprehensive, software engineering-focused roadmap for operationalizing Responsible AI. It moves beyond abstract ethical discussions and isolated algorithmic fixes to offer a structured, lifecycle-oriented approach, making RAI more tangible and actionable for practitioners.\n*   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n    *   **Structured Research Agenda**: Provides a clear research agenda by identifying critical challenges in multi-level governance, process integration, and responsible-AI-by-design.\n    *   **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Highlights the necessity for improved communication and collaboration between software engineers, machine learning experts, social scientists, and ethicists.\n    *   **Tooling and Method Development**: Will likely spur research into developing specific tools, methods, and architectural patterns that implement the practices outlined in the roadmap (e.g., ethical requirement elicitation tools, ethical risk assessment frameworks, automated ethical code review, and verifiable credential infrastructures) \\cite{lu2022et0}.\n    *   **Education**: Emphasizes the urgent need for responsible AI education, influencing curriculum development in computer science and software engineering.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the job market for Artificial Intelligence (AI) engineers has exploded. Since the role of AI engineer is relatively new, limited research has been done on the requirements as set by the industry. Moreover, the definition of an AI engineer is less established than for a data scientist or a software engineer. In this study we explore, based on job ads, the requirements from the job market for the position of AI engineer in The Netherlands. We retrieved job ad data between April 2018 and April 2021 from a large job ad database, Jobfeed from TextKernel. The job ads were selected with a process similar to the selection of primary studies in a literature review. We characterize the 367 resulting job ads based on meta-data such as publication date, industry/sector, educational background and job titles. To answer our research questions we have further coded 125 job ads manually. The job tasks of AI engineers are concentrated in five categories: business understanding, data engineering, modeling, software development and operations engineering. Companies ask for AI engineers with different profiles: 1) data science engineer with focus on modeling, 2) AI software engineer with focus on software development, 3) generalist AI engineer with focus on both models and software. Furthermore, we present the tools and technologies mentioned in the selected job ads, and the soft skills. Our research helps to understand the expectations companies have for professionals building AI-enabled systems. Understanding these expectations is crucial both for prospective AI engineers and educational institutions in charge of training those prospective engineers.

[haakman2020xky] AI lifecycle models need to be revised (2020)**\n*   **Methodological/Conceptual Shift:** This paper marks a foundational shift from accepting generic AI/ML lifecycle models (like CRISP-DM) to critically evaluating their practical applicability in regulated, real-world software engineering contexts. It emphasizes an empirical, qualitative approach (exploratory single-case study with semi-structured interviews) to identify process deficiencies.\n*   **Problems Addressed:** It addresses the problem that existing AI lifecycle models are inadequate for regulated domains (specifically fintech), failing to account for critical stages like comprehensive data collection, feasibility studies, robust documentation, continuous model monitoring, and explicit model risk assessment. These omissions lead to challenges in compliance, auditability, and long-term maintainability.\n*   **Innovations/Capabilities:** Introduces the empirical identification and articulation of five crucial, previously overlooked stages in the AI lifecycle. It provides a refined conceptual framework for AI engineering processes that better supports regulatory compliance and risk management.\n*   **Temporal Gaps/Clusters:** This paper precedes others, establishing a baseline for the need for more robust AI engineering processes.\n\n**2. [borg20214da] Agility in Software 2.0 - Notebook Interfaces and MLOps with Buttresses and Rebars (2021)**\n*   **Methodological/Conceptual Shift:** Shifts from identifying *process gaps* to proposing *technical and architectural solutions* for achieving agility and quality in ML development and operations. It introduces a blend of practical system design (FUSE-based CSI driver with quantitative and qualitative validation) and conceptual framework development (MLOps \"buttresses and rebars\").\n*   **Problems Addressed:** Addresses the intrinsic weaknesses of cloud-based notebook interfaces for production-grade ML (lack of software engineering practices, refactoring, deployment) and the need for robust, continuous engineering (MLOps) to ensure trustworthiness and maintainability of ML systems, especially given the \"Changing Anything Changes Everything\" (CACE) principle. It implicitly tackles the operationalization challenges that arise from the lifecycle gaps identified by [haakman2020xky].\n*   **Innovations/Capabilities:** Introduces a novel FUSE-based CSI driver for seamless integration between local IDEs and remote notebook environments, enhancing developer agility and enabling better software engineering practices. Proposes the \"buttresses and rebars\" metaphor for MLOps, emphasizing structural integrity and continuous reinforcement for trustworthy AI, which is a prerequisite for compliance.\n*   **Temporal Gaps/Clusters:** Published shortly after [haakman2020xky], it begins to offer concrete engineering solutions for the operational aspects of AI development, moving beyond process identification to practical implementation.\n\n**3. [vakkuri2021n6l] Time for AI (Ethics) Maturity Model Is Now (2021)**\n*   **Methodological/Conceptual Shift:** Shifts from identifying specific process/technical gaps to proposing a *strategic, process-oriented framework* for systematic improvement. It advocates for adapting the proven concept of maturity models from traditional software engineering to the unique ethical and quality challenges of AI. This is a conceptual proposal, motivated by prior empirical work.\n*   **Problems Addressed:** Addresses the critical problem that high-level AI ethics principles and guidelines fail to translate into actionable advice for practitioners, leading to a significant gap between ethical aspirations and practical AI software development. It highlights that traditional software engineering maturity models are insufficient for AI's probabilistic, data-centric, and ethically complex nature. This directly follows the need for robust processes and trustworthiness discussed in previous papers.\n*   **Innovations/Capabilities:** Proposes the conceptual framework for an AI (Ethics) Maturity Model, arguing for its necessity to standardize, benchmark, and disseminate best practices for ethical AI engineering. It provides a detailed analysis of unique AI characteristics that necessitate such a model.\n*   **Temporal Gaps/Clusters:** Published in the same year as [borg20214da], it complements the operational focus with a strategic, organizational-level approach to embedding ethics and quality.\n\n**4. [lu2022et0] Towards a Roadmap on Software Engineering for Responsible AI (2022)**\n*   **Methodological/Conceptual Shift:** This paper represents a significant synthesis, moving from conceptual proposals (maturity model) and specific technical solutions (MLOps infrastructure) to a *comprehensive, actionable roadmap* for operationalizing Responsible AI (RAI) across the entire software development lifecycle. It uses a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to consolidate existing knowledge and propose a structured way forward.\n*   **Problems Addressed:** Directly tackles the problem that high-level ethical principles lack concrete, actionable guidance for software engineers, and that existing algorithmic solutions for RAI are isolated. It aims to bridge the gap between abstract principles and practical implementation, addressing the \"how-to\" challenge identified by [vakkuri2021n6l] and providing a structured approach to the lifecycle gaps identified by [haakman2020xky].\n*   **Innovations/Capabilities:** Proposes a holistic, software engineering-centric roadmap for RAI, structured around multi-level governance, process-oriented practices (for Requirements Engineering, Design, Implementation, Verification & Validation, and Operation), and Responsible-AI-by-Design principles. It provides concrete mechanisms and practices for each stage, offering a detailed blueprint for achieving compliance and ethical AI.\n*   **Temporal Gaps/Clusters:** Published in 2022, it builds directly on the identified needs for improved lifecycle management, trustworthiness, and ethical integration, offering a consolidated framework.\n\n**5. [golendukhina2022kqe] What is Software Quality for AI Engineers? Towards a Thinning of the Fog (2022)**\n*   **Methodological/Conceptual Shift:** Shifts back to an *empirical, qualitative study* (semi-structured interviews) from the developer's perspective, providing ground-level evidence for the challenges that the proposed roadmaps and maturity models aim to solve. It focuses on *internal software quality* issues, grounding abstract discussions in concrete, observed problems.\n*   **Problems Addressed:** Addresses the critical problem that Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is often overlooked in AI-enabled systems, particularly in SMEs, due to AI engineers lacking SQA training. This leads to low code quality, inadequate testing, and poor maintainability, directly impacting the trustworthiness and compliance goals articulated by previous papers. It provides concrete examples of the \"fog\" that [lu2022et0] and [vakkuri2021n6l] seek to clear.\n*   **Innovations/Capabilities:** Empirically identifies 12 distinct internal quality issues in AI-enabled systems (e.g., data handling as the most frequent). Provides insights into *when* and *how* these issues arise and are detected, and practical workarounds adopted by companies. This offers valuable, real-world data to inform the development of more effective SQA processes and tools for AI.\n*   **Temporal Gaps/Clusters:** Published in the same year as [lu2022et0], it provides crucial empirical validation and detailed problem identification that underpins the need for comprehensive RAI roadmaps and maturity models.\n\n**6. [martnezfernndez2023ipo] Towards green AI-based software systems: an architecture-centric approach (GAISSA) (2023)**\n*   **Methodological/Conceptual Shift:** Introduces a *new dimension of compliance and responsibility* – environmental sustainability (\"greenability\") – and proposes an *architecture-centric approach* to integrate it. It moves beyond traditional quality attributes to encompass broader societal impact. This is a conceptual proposal for a new framework, with initial results referenced externally.\n*   **Problems Addressed:** Addresses the significant energy consumption and environmental footprint of AI-based systems, a problem largely overlooked by \"red AI\" development that prioritizes accuracy. It highlights the lack of architectural methods and tools to integrate energy efficiency into AI system design and development. This expands the definition of \"responsible\" and \"ethical\" AI from previous papers.\n*   **Innovations/Capabilities:** Proposes the GAISSA project, an architecture-centric approach to systematically integrate greenability into AI systems. This includes developing an AI-specific quality model for greenability, predictive models for energy efficiency, and a catalogue of architecture/design patterns for green AI. It aims to provide tool-supported methods for green AI development.\n*   **Temporal Gaps/Clusters:** Published in 2023, it represents the latest evolution, broadening the scope of \"AI for Software Development Compliance\" to include environmental impact, demonstrating a continuous expansion of what \"responsible\" and \"compliant\" AI entails.\n\n---\n\n**2. Evolution Analysis: Cohesive Narrative**\n\nThe evolution of research in \"AI for Software Development Compliance\" across these six papers reveals two major, interconnected trends: **Trend 1: The Maturation from Ad-Hoc AI Development to Structured, Lifecycle-Oriented AI Engineering** and **Trend 2: The Broadening Definition of \"Quality\" and \"Responsibility\" in AI Systems to Encompass Ethics, Trustworthiness, and Sustainability.**\n\n*Trend 1: The Maturation from Ad-Hoc AI Development to Structured, Lifecycle-Oriented AI Engineering*\n- *Methodological progression*: This trend begins with an empirical identification of deficiencies in existing AI development processes, moving towards conceptual frameworks and comprehensive roadmaps, and finally grounding these with real-world qualitative data. [haakman2020xky] initiates this by employing an *exploratory single-case study* at a large financial institution. This qualitative approach reveals the practical shortcomings of generic AI lifecycle models. Building on this, [vakkuri2021n6l] proposes a *conceptual framework* for an AI (Ethics) Maturity Model, shifting the focus to a structured, process-improvement methodology. This conceptualization is then significantly advanced by [lu2022et0], which utilizes a *Systematic Literature Review (SLR)* to synthesize existing knowledge into a comprehensive, actionable roadmap. Finally, [golendukhina2022kqe] provides crucial *empirical validation* through semi-structured interviews with AI engineers, offering ground-level insights into the specific quality issues that necessitate these structured engineering approaches.\n\n- *Problem evolution*: The initial problem, as identified by [haakman2020xky], is the inadequacy of existing AI lifecycle models for regulated environments, leading to overlooked stages like data collection, documentation, monitoring, and risk assessment. This highlights a fundamental *process gap*. [vakkuri2021n6l] then addresses the problem that high-level AI ethics principles lack actionable guidance, arguing that traditional software engineering maturity models are insufficient for AI's unique characteristics. This evolves the problem from mere process gaps to a *lack of structured integration for ethical considerations*. [lu2022et0] tackles the challenge of operationalizing Responsible AI by bridging the gap between abstract principles and isolated algorithmic solutions, aiming to provide concrete, lifecycle-integrated guidance. [golendukhina2022kqe] further grounds these problems by empirically demonstrating that Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is often overlooked in AI development, leading to tangible issues like \"data handling\" problems and poor maintainability, which directly undermine the goals of trustworthiness and compliance.\n\n- *Key innovations*: [haakman2020xky]'s key innovation is the empirical identification of five critical, overlooked stages in the AI lifecycle, providing a more realistic and compliance-aware process model. [vakkuri2021n6l] innovates by proposing the necessity of an AI-specific maturity model, providing a strategic framework for systematic ethical and quality improvement. The most significant innovation in this trend comes from [lu2022et0], which delivers a holistic, software engineering-centric roadmap for Responsible AI, detailing multi-level governance, process-oriented practices across the SDLC, and Responsible-AI-by-Design principles. This roadmap offers a concrete blueprint for operationalizing complex ethical requirements. [golendukhina2022kqe] contributes by empirically identifying 12 distinct internal quality issues, providing practical insights into *when* and *how* these issues manifest, which is invaluable for refining and validating the proposed engineering practices.\n\n*Trend 2: The Broadening Definition of \"Quality\" and \"Responsibility\" in AI Systems to Encompass Ethics, Trustworthiness, and Sustainability*\n- *Methodological progression*: This trend starts with a focus on regulatory compliance and risk, then expands to include operational trustworthiness, ethical integration, and finally environmental sustainability. [haakman2020xky] uses a *case study* to highlight the need for processes that ensure *regulatory compliance* and *risk assessment*. [borg20214da] introduces *technical solutions* (FUSE-based CSI driver) and a *conceptual framework* (\"buttresses and rebars\" MLOps) to build *trustworthy and maintainable* AI systems. [vakkuri2021n6l] proposes a *maturity model* to systematically integrate *ethical requirements*. [lu2022et0] synthesizes these into a comprehensive *roadmap* for *Responsible AI*, encompassing a wide array of ethical and quality attributes. Finally, [martnezfernndez2023ipo] proposes an *architecture-centric approach* to integrate *environmental sustainability*, expanding the scope of \"responsibility\" even further.\n\n- *Problem evolution*: Initially, the problem is framed by [haakman2020xky] as ensuring AI systems meet *regulatory and risk management* requirements in regulated industries. [borg20214da] then addresses the challenge of achieving *operational trustworthiness and maintainability* in agile ML development, particularly in transitioning from prototypes to production-grade systems. [vakkuri2021n6l] identifies the gap in translating abstract *AI ethics principles* into actionable development practices. [lu2022et0] consolidates these by addressing the overarching problem of *operationalizing Responsible AI*, which includes fairness, transparency, privacy, and accountability, across the entire lifecycle. The latest evolution, presented by [martnezfernndez2023ipo], tackles the significant *energy consumption and environmental footprint* of AI systems, highlighting that current \"red AI\" development neglects \"greenability,\" thus expanding the definition of responsible AI to include ecological impact.\n\n- *Key innovations*: [borg20214da]'s FUSE-based CSI driver is a technical innovation enabling more robust and trustworthy development environments. Its \"buttresses and rebars\" MLOps metaphor provides a conceptual framework for continuous reinforcement of AI system integrity. [vakkuri2021n6l]'s proposal for an AI (Ethics) Maturity Model is a key innovation for systematically embedding ethical considerations. [lu2022et0]'s comprehensive roadmap for Responsible AI, with its detailed practices for governance, lifecycle integration, and design, is a major contribution for operationalizing a broad set of quality attributes. Finally, [martnezfernndez2023ipo] introduces the novel concept of \"greenability\" as a first-class concern in AI architecture, proposing an AI-specific quality model and architectural patterns to address the environmental impact of AI, thereby significantly broadening the scope of \"AI for Software Development Compliance.\"\n\n**3. Synthesis:**\n\nThese works collectively trace an intellectual trajectory from identifying fundamental process and quality deficiencies in AI development to proposing increasingly comprehensive, structured, and multi-faceted engineering solutions. Their collective contribution is to advance \"AI for Software Development Compliance\" by transforming it from an ad-hoc concern into a systematic, lifecycle-integrated discipline that encompasses regulatory adherence, operational trustworthiness, ethical considerations, and environmental sustainability."

    "summary": "1. *Chronological Analysis:*\n\n**[wu2021t2c] Sustainable AI: Environmental Implications, Challenges and Opportunities (2021)**\n*   **Methodological/Conceptual Shift**: This paper introduces a significant methodological shift by moving from fragmented analyses of AI's environmental impact (e.g., focusing only on training a single model) to a **holistic, end-to-end framework**. This framework comprehensively considers the entire Machine Learning (ML) development cycle (Data Processing, Experimentation, Training, Inference) and the full life cycle of AI system hardware (Manufacturing, Transport, Product Use, Recycling), integrating both operational and embodied carbon footprints.\n*   **Problems Addressed**:\n    *   The critical gap in understanding the \"real environmental impact\" of AI due to the lack of a holistic perspective.\n    *   The oversight of the end-to-end ML pipeline and the full life cycle of hardware (particularly embodied carbon) in previous carbon footprint assessments.\n    *   The need to characterize how carbon footprint contributions vary across different ML pipeline phases and model types.\n*   **Innovations/Capabilities Introduced**:\n    *   A novel, comprehensive framework for analyzing AI's environmental footprint, encompassing all phases of the ML pipeline and hardware life cycle.\n    *   Empirical quantification and demonstration of the significant contribution of *embodied carbon footprint* (from hardware manufacturing), showing it can become the dominating factor.\n    *   Identification and empirical validation of hardware-software co-design and at-scale optimization as effective strategies for substantial carbon footprint reduction in real-world, industry-scale ML deployments.\n    *   Detailed insights into how carbon footprint contributions vary across ML pipeline phases and model types.\n*   **Temporal Gaps/External Influences**: Published in 2021, this paper reflects a growing global awareness of climate change and the rapidly increasing computational demands of AI. It provides foundational empirical evidence and a call to action, setting the stage for subsequent research on practical solutions.\n\n**[martnezfernndez2023ipo] Towards green AI-based software systems: an architecture-centric approach (GAISSA) (2023)**\n*   **Methodological/Conceptual Shift**: Building directly on the problem identified by [wu2021t2c] (AI's significant environmental footprint), this paper shifts the methodological focus from *measurement and high-level strategy identification* to **prescriptive, architecture-centric design and development methodologies**. It proposes systematically integrating \"greenability\" as a first-class concern into the AI engineering lifecycle, moving from understanding \"what is the problem and how big is it?\" to \"how do we systematically build solutions?\".\n*   **Problems Addressed (unsolved or unexplored by previous paper)**:\n    *   While [wu2021t2c] identified the problem and suggested high-level solutions (e.g., hardware-software co-design), it did not provide concrete, actionable methods, models, or patterns for software engineers and data scientists to implement \"greenability\" in their AI systems.\n    *   The lack of existing software sustainability quality models that specifically address the unique characteristics and lifecycle phases of AI-based systems.\n    *   The absence of architecture and design patterns tailored for building green AI-based systems.\n    *   The need for comprehensive tools to support greenability-driven analysis, decision-making, and what-if analysis during AI system development.\n*   **Innovations/Capabilities Introduced**:\n    *   A novel **AI-specific quality model for greenability**, providing a structured, hierarchical framework for defining, operationalizing, and understanding sustainability in AI systems.\n    *   **Predictive models** to guide sustainability-aware AI model training and context-aware measurement methods for AI platform energy consumption, enabling proactive green design.\n    *   A **catalogue of architecture and design patterns** specifically for building green AI-based systems, offering reusable solutions for common greenability challenges.\n    *   The conceptualization of **analytic tools** for greenability-driven decision-making and reporting, facilitating the integration of environmental considerations into the development workflow.\n*   **Temporal Gaps/External Influences**: The 2-year gap between [wu2021t2c] and [martnezfernndez2023ipo] indicates a rapid progression from problem identification and quantification to the proposal of systematic engineering solutions. This quick follow-up suggests a strong and immediate need in the field, likely driven by increasing regulatory pressure (e.g., EU targets for GHG emission reductions) and industry demand for sustainable practices, which [wu2021t2c] helped to highlight.\n\n2. *Evolution Analysis:*\n\nThe intellectual trajectory across these papers reveals a clear and urgent progression from **comprehensively quantifying the environmental impact of AI at a systemic level** to **developing actionable, architecture-centric methodologies for building green AI systems**. This evolution is a direct response to the escalating awareness of AI's substantial carbon footprint and the growing imperative for sustainable and compliant software development practices.\n\n*Trend 1: From Problem Quantification to Holistic System-Level Analysis*\n\nThe initial phase of this research trajectory is powerfully established by **[wu2021t2c] Sustainable AI: Environmental Implications, Challenges and Opportunities (2021)**. Before this work, the environmental discourse around AI was often fragmented, focusing predominantly on the carbon footprint of training individual large models. This narrow view presented a significant problem: it failed to provide a \"holistic perspective\" necessary to understand the \"real environmental impact\" across the entire AI ecosystem.\n\n**[wu2021t2c]** introduced a critical methodological progression by proposing the first holistic framework for characterizing AI's carbon footprint. This framework innovatively moved beyond isolated training costs to encompass the entire ML development cycle—from data processing and experimentation to training and inference—and the full life cycle of AI system hardware, critically integrating both operational and embodied carbon. A key innovation was the empirical demonstration that embodied carbon from hardware manufacturing could be a dominating factor, especially when operational emissions are mitigated by carbon-free energy. This paper also provided crucial insights into how carbon footprint contributions vary across different ML pipeline phases and model types, offering a comprehensive understanding of the problem. Its extensive experimental validation, analyzing large-scale production and open-source models, provided concrete evidence for the severity and complexity of the issue, fundamentally shifting the state-of-the-art from fragmented analyses to a system-level perspective.\n\n*Trend 2: From High-Level Strategies to Architecture-Centric Design and Development Methodologies for Green AI*\n\nBuilding directly upon the foundational understanding and call to action provided by **[wu2021t2c]**, the research then transitioned towards developing concrete engineering solutions. While **[wu2021t2c]** identified high-level strategies like hardware-software co-design and at-scale optimization as crucial for reduction, it did not provide the detailed, systematic methodologies, models, or patterns needed by software engineers and data scientists to implement these strategies effectively. This gap in actionable guidance for building \"green AI\" systems became the central problem addressed by subsequent work.\n\n**[martnezfernndez2023ipo] Towards green AI-based software systems: an architecture-centric approach (GAISSA) (2023)** represents a significant methodological progression by proposing an architecture-centric approach to integrate \"greenability\" as a first-class concern into the AI engineering lifecycle. The problem evolution here is clear: moving from *identifying the need for optimization* to *providing the systematic means to achieve it*. **[martnezfernndez2023ipo]** introduces several key innovations:\n1.  An **AI-specific quality model for greenability**, which provides a structured way to define, measure, and manage sustainability in AI systems, a capability entirely absent in previous, more general sustainability models.\n2.  **Predictive models** designed to guide sustainability-aware AI model training and deployment, directly operationalizing the concept of hardware-software co-design by allowing engineers to understand the energy impact of their design choices before implementation.\n3.  A **catalogue of architecture and design patterns** specifically tailored for building green AI-based systems, offering reusable, proven solutions to common greenability challenges.\n4.  The conceptualization of **analytic tools** for greenability-driven decision-making, enabling \"what-if\" analysis for different AI alternatives, thereby empowering developers to make environmentally conscious choices throughout the development process.\n\nThis shift from broad problem characterization to detailed architectural solutions highlights a maturing field that is not only aware of its environmental responsibilities but is actively developing the engineering discipline to address them. The emphasis on an architecture-centric approach in **[martnezfernndez2023ipo]** underscores the recognition that greenability must be designed into AI systems from the ground up, rather than being an afterthought, directly supporting the broader goal of AI for Software Development Compliance by making sustainability an inherent quality.\n\n3. *Synthesis:*\n\nThese works collectively trace a critical intellectual trajectory from empirically quantifying the holistic environmental footprint of AI to proposing systematic, architecture-centric methodologies for designing and developing energy-efficient AI systems. Their unified contribution to advancing \"AI for Software Development Compliance\" lies in establishing the imperative for \"green AI\" and providing foundational frameworks and actionable engineering approaches that enable developers to build AI systems that are inherently more sustainable, thereby facilitating adherence to emerging environmental regulations and ethical standards.",

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **CITATION**: \\cite{wu2021t2c}\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the rapidly growing and significant environmental impact (carbon footprint) of Artificial Intelligence (AI) computing, which is driven by super-linear growth in AI data, model sizes, and infrastructure capacity \\cite{wu2021t2c}.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: This problem is critical because AI's exponential growth, while offering societal benefits, creates a self-accelerating demand on environmental resources. Previous work often focused only on the carbon footprint of training a single large model, which is insufficient for understanding the full impact. The challenge lies in holistically characterizing this impact across the entire AI ecosystem, including both operational and embodied carbon, and optimizing across complex, interconnected ML pipelines and system life cycles \\cite{wu2021t2c}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: The paper acknowledges prior work that quantifies the carbon footprint of training individual large ML models (e.g., Meena \\cite{wu2021t2c}).\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: It explicitly states that such prior work only captures \"one aspect\" and fails to provide a \"holistic perspective\" needed to understand the \"real environmental impact.\" Previous solutions often overlook the end-to-end ML pipeline (data, experimentation, inference) and the full life cycle of hardware (manufacturing, operational use, embodied carbon) \\cite{wu2021t2c}. This paper positions itself as the first to take such a holistic approach.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes a holistic framework to characterize AI's carbon footprint by examining the entire model development cycle (Data Processing, Experimentation, Training, and Inference) and the full life cycle of AI system hardware (Manufacturing, Transport, Product Use, and Recycling, with a focus on manufacturing and product use) \\cite{wu2021t2c}. It integrates both operational (energy consumption during use) and embodied (manufacturing) carbon footprints.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**: The innovation lies in its comprehensive, end-to-end analysis that spans data, algorithms, and system hardware, considering both operational and embodied carbon across all phases of the ML pipeline and hardware life cycle. It emphasizes the importance of hardware-software co-design and at-scale optimization as key strategies for reduction \\cite{wu2021t2c}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Framework**: Introduction of a holistic framework for analyzing AI's environmental footprint, encompassing the entire ML development cycle and system hardware life cycle, moving beyond single-model training analysis \\cite{wu2021t2c}.\n    *   **End-to-End Carbon Analysis**: Empirical demonstration and quantification of the significant contribution of *embodied carbon footprint* (from hardware manufacturing) to the overall AI carbon footprint, showing it can become the dominating factor when operational emissions are mitigated by carbon-free energy \\cite{wu2021t2c}.\n    *   **Optimization Strategies**: Identification and empirical validation of hardware-software co-design and at-scale optimization as effective strategies for substantial carbon footprint reduction in real-world, industry-scale ML deployments \\cite{wu2021t2c}.\n    *   **Insights into ML Pipeline Impact**: Characterization of how carbon footprint contributions vary across different ML pipeline phases (e.g., training vs. inference) and model types (e.g., recommendation models vs. language models) \\cite{wu2021t2c}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: The paper analyzes six representative, large-scale production machine learning models at Facebook (e.g., Transformer-based Universal Language Model, Deep Learning Recommendation Models) and compares their carbon footprints with seven large-scale open-source models (e.g., BERT-NAS, T5, Meena, GPT-3, Switch Transformer) \\cite{wu2021t2c}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Results**:\n        *   **Operational Carbon Footprint**: Measured in CO2e (kg) for offline training, online training, and inference. It shows that for recommendation models, training and inference contribute roughly equally, while for language models, inference dominates (65% vs. 35%) \\cite{wu2021t2c}.\n        *   **Embodied Carbon Footprint**: Estimated using Life Cycle Analysis (LCA), revealing that manufacturing carbon cost is roughly 50% of the location-based operational carbon footprint for large-scale ML tasks \\cite{wu2021t2c}.\n        *   **Optimization Impact**: Demonstrated an \"over 800% operational carbon footprint reduction achieved through judicious hardware-software co-design for a Transformer-based universal language model\" \\cite{wu2021t2c}.\n        *   **Model Architecture Efficiency**: Showed that models with more parameters do not necessarily lead to higher emissions (e.g., Switch Transformer with 1.5 trillion parameters had significantly less carbon emission than GPT-3 with 750 billion parameters), highlighting the advantage of operationally-efficient architectures \\cite{wu2021t2c}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: Quantifying the exact breakdown between operational and embodied carbon footprint is complex \\cite{wu2021t2c}. The embodied carbon estimation assumes GPU-based AI training systems have similar embodied carbon as servers.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: While the analysis is based on industry-scale Facebook data centers, the general insights regarding holistic analysis, embodied carbon, and hardware-software co-design are broadly applicable.

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \"Towards green AI-based software systems: an architecture-centric approach (GAISSA)\" \\cite{martnezfernndez2023ipo} for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the significant energy consumption and environmental footprint of AI-based systems, particularly during model training and inference, which stems from the high computational resources required by large AI models and data volumes.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: This problem is critical due to increasing societal demand for energy efficiency, stringent environmental regulations (e.g., EU targets for GHG emission reductions), and the dramatic growth in computing resources used for AI (e.g., 300,000x increase in DL training compute in 6 years). Current AI development primarily targets accuracy (\"red AI\"), often disregarding energy costs, leading to substantial carbon footprints (e.g., training one large ML model for autonomous vehicles equivalent to 242,231 miles driven by a passenger vehicle). The challenge lies in integrating energy efficiency (\"greenability\") into the design and development of AI systems, which current architecture-centric methods largely overlook.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: The work builds upon existing research in software sustainability, quality models for general software (e.g., ISO/IEC 25010 extensions with \"greenability,\" GREENSOFT model), and some initial efforts in energy-efficient AI models and architectural/design patterns for sustainability. It also acknowledges existing tools for general software energy profiling and cloud carbon footprint dashboards.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   Existing software sustainability quality models do not specifically address the unique characteristics and lifecycle phases (data collection, model training, optimization) of AI-based systems.\n        *   Current approaches for energy-efficient AI models from an architectural perspective are scarce, ad-hoc, and lack transferability.\n        *   Architectural and design patterns for general software sustainability do not consider AI-based systems, and conversely, patterns for AI-based systems do not address greenability.\n        *   No current tool comprehensively supports the modelling and development cycles of AI-based systems from an energy efficiency-aware perspective, offering assessments, estimations, and what-if analysis for AI-specific choices (libraries, training, deployment architectures).\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The GAISSA project proposes an **architecture-centric approach** to provide data scientists and software engineers with tool-supported methods for the modelling and development of green AI-based systems. It focuses on understanding, defining, reporting, and managing the energy efficiency impact of architectural decisions throughout the AI engineering lifecycle, specifically during the Modelling and Development stages.\n    *   **Novelty**: The approach is novel by systematically integrating \"greenability\" as a first-class concern into the architectural design and development of AI-based systems. This involves:\n        *   Developing an AI-specific quality model for greenability.\n        *   Creating predictive models to understand how AI model design decisions affect energy efficiency.\n        *   Defining architecture and design patterns tailored for building green AI-based systems.\n        *   Developing analytic tools for greenability-driven analysis, decision-making, and reporting, including what-if analysis for different AI alternatives.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms, Methods, or Techniques**:\n        *   **O1: Quality Model for Greenability of AI-based Systems**: A hierarchical structure of greenability-related quality factors, operationalized metrics, and understanding of synergies/conflicts with other qualities (e.g., accuracy, privacy).\n        *   **O2: Architecture-centric Methods for Green AI Model Training & Deployment**: Predictive models to guide sustainability-aware AI model training and context-aware measurement methods for AI platform energy consumption.\n        *   **O3: Architecture-centric Methods for Green AI-based System Development**: Identification of architectural concerns driving green design and a catalogue of architecture and design patterns for building green AI-based systems, detailing their forces and interactions.\n    *   **System Design or Architectural Innovations**: The project aims to provide a framework and catalogue of patterns that explicitly link architectural decisions to greenability outcomes in AI systems, moving beyond ad-hoc solutions.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights or Analysis**: The project hypothesizes that a better understanding and management of architectural decisions' impact on energy efficiency is crucial for delivering less computationally demanding AI-based systems.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   The paper states that the GAISSA project is in an initial stage. While it mentions \"current research results, which illustrate the potential to achieve GAISSA objectives,\" it explicitly notes, \"Due to space limitations, we only summarize the initial results of GAISSA. The interested reader is referred to [29] for a detailed description of the initial results.\"\n    *   Therefore, this paper *does not present detailed experimental validation or key performance metrics and comparison results itself*. It indicates that initial results include a first version of the quality model for greenability (O1) and a first version of a catalogue of architecture and design patterns for green AI-based systems (O3), with full details available in a separate publication.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The project is in its initial stages, and the full implementation and evaluation of all proposed objectives are ongoing. The paper does not detail specific technical limitations of the proposed methods themselves, but rather highlights the current gaps in the field.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: GAISSA focuses specifically on the **Modelling** (AI model training) and **Development** (AI model integration into software, system deployment) stages of the AI engineering lifecycle, acknowledging that these stages present unique challenges beyond traditional software engineering. It does not explicitly cover Data Management or Operation stages in detail within its current scope.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: GAISSA advances the technical state-of-the-art by proposing a comprehensive, systematic, and architecture-centric approach to address the energy efficiency of AI-based systems. It moves beyond general software sustainability to tackle the unique challenges of AI, aiming to provide concrete methods, models, patterns, and tools where current solutions are fragmented or non-existent.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: The project has the potential to significantly impact future research by:\n        *   Establishing a foundational quality model and metrics for greenability in AI.\n        *   Guiding the development of energy-efficient AI models and platforms through predictive and context-aware methods.\n        *   Providing a catalogue of architectural and design patterns to foster the creation of greener AI-based systems.\n        *   Developing analytic tools that enable greenability-driven decision-making, fostering a shift from \"red AI\" to \"green AI\" practices in industry and academia.",

    "summary": "1. *Chronological Analysis:*\n\n*   **Paper:** [sauvola2024zw7] Future of software development with generative AI (2024) - *Summary: LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS AS TOOL MAKERS*\n    *   **Methodological/Conceptual Shifts:** This paper introduces a profound conceptual and methodological shift from Large Language Models (LLMs) merely *using* pre-existing external tools (e.g., via Chain-of-Thought prompting, API calls, or Python executors for sub-steps) to LLMs *autonomously creating, verifying, and managing their own reusable programmatic tools*. This elevates LLMs from reactive tool-users to proactive tool-makers, mimicking a fundamental aspect of human intelligence and software engineering.\n    *   **Problems Addressed (that previous approaches left unsolved or unexplored):**\n        *   **Limited Autonomy & Tool Dependency:** Prior LLM applications were constrained by the availability and scope of human-provided tools. This work addresses the lack of LLM capability to autonomously design, implement, and verify novel, reusable programmatic solutions for problems where suitable tools don't exist or are inefficient.\n        *   **High Inference Costs for Repetitive Complex Tasks:** While powerful LLMs can solve complex problems, their high inference costs make repetitive application economically unfeasible. The paper tackles this by proposing a strategic division of labor, amortizing the cost of tool creation over many uses by a lightweight LLM.\n        *   **Lack of Reusability for LLM-generated Code:** While some prior work involved LLMs generating code for specific sub-steps, it lacked a robust framework for verifying, wrapping, and systematically reusing these programmatic solutions across different task instances.\n    *   **Innovations/Capabilities Introduced:**\n        *   **LLMs AsToolMakers (LATM) Framework:** A novel closed-loop system enabling LLMs to generate and reuse Python-based tools.\n        *   **Two-Phase Architecture:** Separates the complex \"Tool Making\" (by a powerful, resource-intensive LLM like GPT-4) from the efficient \"Tool Using\" (by a lightweight, cost-effective LLM like GPT-3.5 Turbo), optimizing both capability and cost.\n        *   **Automated Tool Verification:** Includes generating unit tests, running them, and self-correcting both the generated code and the unit test calls, ensuring reliability.\n        *   **Functional Cache:** A novel caching mechanism that stores reusable *functionality* (Python tools) for categories of requests, rather than just natural language responses, enhancing efficiency for recurring tasks.\n        *   **Dispatcher LLM:** A lightweight LLM responsible for intelligently managing the functional cache, deciding whether to use an existing tool or trigger the tool maker for new problems within a streaming request environment.\n    *   **Temporal Gaps or Clusters/External Influences:** The emergence of highly capable yet costly LLMs (like GPT-4) alongside more efficient, lightweight models (like GPT-3.5 Turbo) directly enables the proposed two-phase architecture and strategic division of labor. The advancements in Chain-of-Thought prompting and tool augmentation research form the immediate intellectual predecessors upon which this work builds, pushing the boundary of LLM capabilities.\n\n2. *Evolution Analysis:*\n\n*Trend 1: The Ascent of Autonomous LLM Agents in Software Development: From Tool Usage to Self-Generated Programmatic Solutions*\n\n*   *Methodological progression*: The landscape of AI in software development has been steadily moving towards greater automation and intelligence. Initially, Large Language Models (LLMs) were primarily seen as powerful text generators, assisting developers with tasks like code completion, documentation, and basic debugging. A significant early methodological progression involved augmenting LLMs with external tools, allowing them to interact with the real world or perform complex calculations. Works in this vein demonstrated LLMs using calculators, search engines, and APIs to extend their problem-solving capabilities, often guided by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. This approach, while powerful, inherently limited LLMs to the functionalities of pre-existing, human-designed tools. The core limitation was that LLMs could *use* tools but not *create* them, leaving a critical gap in their autonomy and adaptability for novel or highly specific problems.\n\n    The paper \"[sauvola2024zw7] Future of software development with generative AI (2024)\", specifically titled \"LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS AS TOOL MAKERS\", introduces a profound methodological shift by enabling LLMs to transcend this limitation. It presents the LLMs AsToolMakers (LATM) framework, a closed-loop system where LLMs autonomously design, implement, verify, and manage their own reusable programmatic tools, primarily in Python. This represents a leap from reactive tool-using to proactive tool-making. The LATM framework's innovation lies in its two-phase architecture: a powerful, resource-intensive LLM (e.g., GPT-4) acts as the \"tool maker,\" crafting generic, reusable functions from demonstrations, while a lightweight, cost-effective LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5 Turbo) serves as the \"tool user,\" applying these verified tools by translating natural language queries into function calls. This strategic division of labor is a key methodological advancement, optimizing both capability and cost-efficiency. Furthermore, the introduction of a \"functional cache\" for storing reusable tools and a \"dispatcher LLM\" for intelligent tool management signifies a sophisticated architectural evolution, moving beyond simple prompt-response interactions to a more dynamic, intelligent system for leveraging AI in software tasks.\n\n*   *Problem evolution*: Early applications of LLMs in software development faced several challenges. While they could assist, their problem-solving was often constrained by the specific tools they were given. If a novel or highly specialized task arose for which no pre-existing tool was available, the LLM's capabilities would hit a wall. Moreover, even for tasks where powerful LLMs could generate solutions, the high inference costs associated with these models made their repetitive application economically prohibitive, especially for routine or high-volume operations. This created a dilemma: powerful LLMs were too expensive for everyday use, and lightweight LLMs lacked the complex reasoning abilities for novel problems. This challenge is particularly acute in domains like software development compliance, where specific, often repetitive, rule-based checks are required across vast codebases, demanding both high accuracy and cost-efficiency.\n\n    \"[sauvola2024zw7]\" directly addresses these critical problems. It tackles the fundamental limitation of LLM autonomy by empowering them to *create* the very tools they need, thereby expanding their problem-solving horizon beyond human-defined boundaries. This solves the \"tool availability\" problem by allowing the LLM to generate custom solutions on demand. Crucially, the paper also resolves the cost-efficiency dilemma. By assigning the one-off, complex task of tool creation to a powerful LLM and the repetitive, simpler task of tool application to a lightweight LLM, LATM significantly reduces the average inference cost. This makes the application of sophisticated LLM capabilities economically viable for recurring workflows, a critical factor for enterprise-level software development. The problem of ensuring the correctness and reusability of LLM-generated code is also addressed through an automated verification process, including self-correction of unit test calls, which was largely unexplored in prior work focused on single-shot code generation.\n\n*   *Key innovations*: The most significant innovation presented by \"[sauvola2024zw7]\" is the **LATM framework** itself, which fundamentally redefines the role of LLMs in software development from passive assistants to active, autonomous problem-solvers. The **two-phase architecture** with its strategic division of labor between a powerful tool maker and a lightweight tool user is a breakthrough in optimizing both performance and cost. The concept of a **functional cache** is another pivotal innovation, moving beyond traditional caching of textual responses to storing and retrieving executable programmatic solutions, which has profound implications for efficiency and scalability in LLM-powered systems. The **dispatcher LLM** further enhances this by intelligently managing the functional cache and orchestrating the tool-making process when new capabilities are required. Finally, the **automated tool verification process**, including the self-correction of unit test calls, is crucial for ensuring the reliability and reusability of the LLM-generated code, a prerequisite for its practical application in real-world software development environments. These innovations collectively enable LLMs to not only generate code but to manage a growing library of self-created, verified, and reusable software components, marking a significant step towards truly autonomous AI agents in software engineering. For \"AI for Software Development Compliance,\" this means the potential for LLMs to autonomously generate, verify, and apply tools for specific regulatory checks (e.g., GDPR data handling, security vulnerabilities, coding standard adherence), significantly enhancing the automation and reliability of compliance processes.\n\n3. *Synthesis* (2-3 sentences):\nThe unified intellectual trajectory connecting these works is the relentless pursuit of increasingly autonomous and efficient AI agents capable of generating and managing their own programmatic solutions for complex and repetitive tasks. \"[sauvola2024zw7] Future of software development with generative AI (2024)\" makes a collective contribution to advancing \"AI for Software Development Compliance\" by providing a foundational framework (LATM) that enables LLMs to autonomously create and verify reusable software tools. This capability is crucial for automating and standardizing compliance checks, policy enforcement, and report generation within software development, transforming compliance from a manual, reactive process into an integrated, proactive, and AI-driven one by allowing LLMs to generate specific compliance-checking functions on demand and apply them efficiently.",

Therefore, this analysis describes the contributions and context of that single paper, setting the stage for what a subsequent paper would build upon, rather than showing evolution *between* two distinct papers.)*\n\n2. *Evolution Analysis:*\n\n**Trend 1: Establishing the Baseline of AI-Assisted Security Risks through Empirical User Studies**\n\n*   *Methodological progression*: The work by [perry2022cq5] \"Do Users Write More Insecure Code with AI Assistants? (2022)\" represents a crucial methodological leap in understanding the security implications of AI for software development. Prior to this, evaluations of AI code generation models largely relied on static datasets or synthetic prompts, which, while useful for assessing model capabilities, failed to capture the complex dynamics of human-AI interaction in real-world development scenarios. [perry2022cq5] pioneered a robust user study methodology, involving 47 participants interacting with an AI assistant to solve security-related programming tasks across multiple languages (Python, JavaScript, C). This shift from purely technical model evaluation to comprehensive human-centered empirical research is a foundational step, providing a blueprint for future studies in usable security for AI-assisted development. The development of a custom UI infrastructure for detailed interaction logging further enabled a granular analysis of user behavior, a significant advancement over previous, less instrumented approaches.\n\n*   *Problem evolution*: [perry2022cq5] directly addresses several critical problems left unsolved by earlier research. While it was known that AI models could generate insecure code, the paper specifically investigates whether *developers using* these AI assistants actually write *more* insecure code, and crucially, *why*. It tackles the unexplored problem of how specific user interaction patterns—such as prompt engineering, query refinement, and the adjustment of AI parameters—directly influence the security posture of the resulting code. Furthermore, it explicitly quantifies the problem of user overconfidence, demonstrating that developers using AI assistants are more likely to believe their code is secure, even when it contains vulnerabilities. This addresses a significant gap in understanding the psychological and behavioral aspects of AI-assisted security, moving beyond just the technical flaws of the AI itself.\n\n*   *Key innovations*: The primary innovation of [perry2022cq5] is its comprehensive, human-centric approach to evaluating AI security risks. The custom-built, open-sourced UI infrastructure is a breakthrough contribution, enabling unprecedented logging of user-AI interactions, which is vital for understanding the causal links between interaction patterns and security outcomes. This allowed for the novel capability of attributing security mistakes to specific sources (AI, Internet, or User) based on detailed interaction data. The paper's empirical findings—that AI access leads to significantly less secure code and increased user overconfidence—are key insights that fundamentally reshape the understanding of AI's role in software security. These innovations provide a critical baseline and a robust methodological toolkit for subsequent research aiming to mitigate these identified risks and improve the security of AI-assisted software development.\n\n3. *Synthesis* (2-3 sentences):\n[perry2022cq5] \"Do Users Write More Insecure Code with AI Assistants? (2022)\" establishes a critical baseline by empirically demonstrating that AI code assistants can lead to less secure code and increased user overconfidence, driven by specific human-AI interaction patterns. This work's collective contribution to \"AI for Software Development Compliance\" is to highlight the urgent need for security-aware AI assistant design, developer education on secure prompt engineering, and robust usable security research to ensure that AI tools enhance, rather than compromise, software security and compliance standards.",

        "abstract": "AI code assistants have emerged as powerful tools that can aid in the software development life-cycle and can improve developer productivity. Unfortunately, such assistants have also been found to produce insecure code in lab environments, raising significant concerns about their usage in practice. In this paper, we conduct a user study to examine how users interact with AI code assistants to solve a variety of security related tasks. Overall, we find that participants who had access to an AI assistant wrote significantly less secure code than those without access to an assistant. Participants with access to an AI assistant were also more likely to believe they wrote secure code, suggesting that such tools may lead users to be overconfident about security flaws in their code. To better inform the design of future AI-based code assistants, we release our user-study apparatus to researchers seeking to build on our work.",

    "summary": "1. *Evolution Analysis:*\n\nThe analysis of `[bellemare2012sge] The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents (2012)` reveals a pivotal moment in the development of general artificial intelligence research, establishing foundational methodologies and tools that would profoundly influence subsequent work. As the sole paper in this \"chain,\" it represents a significant conceptual and methodological shift from previous, more fragmented approaches to AI evaluation.\n\n*   **Methodological or Conceptual Shifts:**\n    *   **From Ad-hoc Benchmarking to Standardized, Large-Scale Evaluation:** The paper introduces a fundamental shift from evaluating AI algorithms on a small number of custom or parameterized problems to a standardized, diverse, and large-scale platform (ALE). This conceptualizes AI evaluation as a rigorous, scientific process requiring broad generalization assessment rather than narrow task-specific performance.\n    *   **From Specific Algorithm Testing to General Competency Assessment:** The core motivation is to evaluate \"general competency\" across a wide variety of tasks, moving beyond merely testing the efficacy of a single algorithm on a few problems. This necessitates a diverse testbed and a robust evaluation methodology.\n    *   **Enabling Model-Based AI through Environmental Generative Models:** A crucial conceptual shift is the realization and implementation of an emulator's save/restore state functionality as a perfect generative model. This transforms the environment from merely a source of observations and rewards into a powerful tool for planning and model-based reinforcement learning research, which was previously challenging in complex, unknown environments.\n\n*   **Specific Problems Addressed that Previous Papers Left Unsolved or Unexplored:**\n    *   **Lack of Rigorous General AI Evaluation:** Prior to ALE, there was no widely accepted, standardized platform for rigorously evaluating general, domain-independent AI algorithms. Existing methods were prone to overfitting and failed to truly assess an agent's ability to generalize to unseen tasks.\n    *   **Scarcity of Diverse, Independently Created Domains:** Researchers struggled to find a sufficiently large and diverse set of tasks that were independently created (i.e., not by the experimenter) to avoid bias and truly test generality.\n    *   **Difficulty in Applying Planning Algorithms to Complex Environments:** While theoretical frameworks for planning existed, applying them to complex, high-dimensional environments like video games was difficult without a perfect generative model of the environment.\n\n*   **Innovations or Capabilities Introduced:**\n    *   **The Arcade Learning Environment (ALE):** A robust, high-performance software framework built on the Stella Atari 2600 emulator, providing access to over 500 diverse game environments.\n    *   **Standardized Reinforcement Learning Problem Formulation:** A game-handling layer that abstracts diverse game mechanics into a uniform RL interface (screen pixels/RAM as observations, 18 discrete joystick actions, score, game termination).\n    *   **Save/Restore State Functionality:** This critical innovation allows ALE to act as a perfect generative model, enabling research in planning and model-based reinforcement learning.\n    *   **Open-Source Platform:** Released as free, open-source software, fostering community engagement and standardized benchmarking.\n    *   **Train/Test Split Methodology:** Proposes and validates a rigorous evaluation methodology where agents are tuned on a small \"training set\" of games and evaluated on a larger, unseen \"testing set\" to assess true generalization.\n\n*   **Temporal Gaps or Clusters:** Not applicable as this analysis focuses on a single paper.\n\n2. *Evolution Analysis:*\n\nThe publication of `[bellemare2012sge] The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents (2012)` marks a significant evolutionary step in the field of artificial intelligence, particularly for reinforcement learning and general AI research. This paper doesn't just present a new algorithm; it fundamentally reshapes the landscape for evaluating and developing AI agents through two major trends: the standardization and scaling of general AI evaluation, and the enabling of model-based AI research through environmental generative models.\n\n*Trend 1: Standardizing and Scaling General AI Evaluation*\n- *Methodological progression*: Before `[bellemare2012sge]`, the evaluation of general AI algorithms was often characterized by a fragmented approach, relying on a limited number of parameterized problems or custom-built environments. This made it difficult to compare different algorithms rigorously and assess their true generalization capabilities. `[bellemare2012sge]` introduced a profound methodological shift by providing the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE), a unified, large-scale platform that transforms hundreds of diverse Atari 2600 games into a standardized reinforcement learning problem. This move towards a common, rich testbed allowed researchers to move beyond ad-hoc benchmarks to a more systematic and rigorous evaluation framework. The paper also proposed and validated a train/test split methodology, where agents are tuned on a small set of \"training games\" and evaluated on a larger, unseen \"testing set,\" a crucial step for assessing true generalization rather than mere memorization or overfitting.\n- *Problem evolution*: The primary problem `[bellemare2012sge]` addressed was the difficulty in rigorously evaluating \"general competency\" in AI. Previous solutions suffered from a lack of diverse, independently created domains, leading to experimenter bias and algorithms that might overfit to specific problem instances. The paper directly tackled this by offering access to over 500 distinct game environments, providing unprecedented diversity and scale. This solved the challenge of finding a sufficiently varied and unbiased testbed necessary for developing and assessing truly domain-independent AI.\n- *Key innovations*: The core innovation is the ALE platform itself, which provides a robust, high-performance interface to a vast library of games. Its game-handling layer abstracts away the complexities of individual games, presenting a uniform RL problem interface. This standardization, coupled with the sheer scale and diversity of the environments, was a breakthrough that significantly lowered the barrier to entry for general AI research and enabled more reliable comparisons between different approaches.\n\n*Trend 2: Enabling Model-Based AI Research through Environmental Generative Models*\n- *Methodological progression*: While reinforcement learning often explores model-free approaches, `[bellemare2012sge]` made a critical methodological contribution by explicitly enabling model-based learning and planning. The paper highlighted and leveraged the ability to save and restore the emulator's state, effectively transforming the environment into a perfect generative model. This was a significant leap for studying planning algorithms in complex, high-dimensional environments where obtaining an accurate model is typically a major challenge. By providing a \"perfect simulator,\" the paper allowed researchers to isolate and study the performance of planning and model-learning algorithms themselves, without the confounding factor of an imperfectly learned model.\n- *Problem evolution*: This trend addressed the long-standing challenge of applying sophisticated planning algorithms to complex, unknown environments. Traditional planning methods often assume a known or easily learnable model of the environment. `[bellemare2012sge]` circumvented this by providing an environment where a perfect model could be queried at will, thus enabling the application and rigorous testing of planning algorithms like Breadth-first Search and UCT directly within the rich and dynamic Atari game worlds. This opened up new avenues for research into how agents can leverage internal models for more intelligent behavior.\n- *Key innovations*: The save/restore state functionality is the critical technical innovation here. It allows researchers to effectively \"rewind\" and \"fast-forward\" the environment, generating hypothetical future states based on chosen actions. This capability is fundamental for model-based reinforcement learning, planning, and even for understanding causality and counterfactual reasoning in AI. Its inclusion in ALE transformed the platform into a versatile tool not just for model-free RL, but also for advanced model-based AI research.\n\n3. *Synthesis*:\n`[bellemare2012sge] The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents (2012)` established a foundational benchmark and methodology for evaluating and advancing general artificial intelligence, particularly in reinforcement learning and planning. While not directly focused on \"AI for Software Development Compliance,\" its collective contribution lies in providing a robust, scalable, and standardized platform for developing and testing general-purpose AI agents, whose principles of rigorous evaluation, generalization assessment, and the ability to model complex systems are indispensable for building reliable and compliant AI systems in any domain, including future applications in software development and compliance.",

Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:**\n        *   **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Evaluated SARSA(λ) with linear function approximation using five different feature sets (Basic, BASS, DISCO, LSH, RAM) on 55 Atari 2600 games.\n        *   **Planning:** Evaluated Breadth-first Search and UCT algorithms using ALE's generative model capabilities on a subset of games.\n        *   **Methodology Validation:** Used a distinct training set (5 games) for parameter tuning and a testing set (50 unseen games) for final evaluation, demonstrating the proposed methodology.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results:**\n        *   **Metric:** Average score achieved during 500 evaluation episodes (after 5,000 training episodes for RL agents).\n        *   **Baselines:** Compared against simple agents (Random, Const, Perturb) and non-expert human performance.\n        *   **RL Findings:**\n            *   Learning agents outperformed baselines in 40 out of 55 games.\n            *   BASS generally performed best among the learning methods.\n            *   The DISCO method showed a significant performance drop on unseen test games, validating the train/test methodology for assessing robustness.\n            *   RAM-based agents did not consistently outperform image-based methods, suggesting the screen image contains crucial structural information.\n        *   **Planning Findings:**\n            *   Planning agents (Breadth-first Search, UCT) significantly outperformed RL agents and baselines on some games (e.g., Asterix, Zaxxon).\n            *   UCT generally outperformed Breadth-first Search, especially on games requiring longer-term planning.\n\n*   **6. Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:**\n        *   Even with a perfect model, the vast state space and sparse rewards in Atari 2600 games make exhaustive search intractable for planning algorithms.\n        *   Current domain-independent RL methods struggle with games requiring high-level planning or elaborate behavior for positive rewards (e.g., Montezuma's Revenge, Tennis).\n        *   The feature sets used for RL, while domain-independent, are still relatively simple and may not capture all necessary information.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:**\n        *   Primarily focused on Atari 2600 games, which are simpler than modern environments but still pose significant challenges.\n        *   While designed for general AI, the immediate goal is \"general competency across the gamut of Atari 2600 games\" \\cite{bellemare2012sge}.\n\n*   **7. Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:**\n        *   **Standardized Benchmark:** Provides the first large-scale, diverse, and standardized evaluation platform for general AI, addressing a critical need in the field.\n        *   **Enabler for Model-Based AI:** The save/restore state functionality is a crucial innovation that enables rigorous research in planning and model-based reinforcement learning.\n        *   **Methodological Rigor:** Introduces and validates a robust train/test evaluation methodology for general agents, promoting more reliable assessment of generalization capabilities.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:**\n        *   Has become a de facto standard benchmark for deep reinforcement learning and general AI research (e.g., AlphaGo, DQN).\n        *   Facilitates the development and comparison of novel algorithms for reinforcement learning, model learning, planning, imitation learning, transfer learning, and intrinsic motivation.\n        *   The open-source nature and ease of use have significantly lowered the barrier to entry for researchers working on general AI problems.",

Offered actionable recommendations for various stakeholders.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Evolution Analysis: Cohesive Narrative\n\n**Trend 1: From Quantifying Individual Productivity to Understanding Complex Human-AI Ecosystems and Mitigating Risks Across the SDLC**\n\nThe evolution of research in AI for software development began with a foundational focus on empirically quantifying the direct impact of AI tools on individual developer productivity. The paper **[peng2023uj3] The Impact of AI on Developer Productivity: Evidence from GitHub Copilot (2023)** pioneered this by conducting the first controlled experiment, demonstrating a significant 55.8% increase in task completion speed. This initial work established a crucial baseline, showing AI's potential to accelerate coding tasks and highlighting its disproportionate benefits for less experienced developers.\n\nHowever, the field quickly recognized that productivity alone was an insufficient metric. The conceptual paper **[alves2023ao6] The centaur programmer - How Kasparov's Advanced Chess spans over to the software development of the future (2023)** immediately broadened the perspective, moving beyond simple AI replacement to propose a \"Centaur Programmer\" paradigm. This marked a significant conceptual shift towards understanding optimal human-AI collaboration models (Guidance, Sketch, Inverted Control), emphasizing synergy over automation. This conceptualization laid the groundwork for integrating AI more deeply into the development process, not just as a code generator but as an intelligent partner.\n\nAs AI tools became more prevalent, understanding their adoption became critical. **[russo2023kua] Navigating the Complexity of Generative AI Adoption in Software Engineering (2023)** addressed the \"glaring lack of empirical research\" on adoption by developing the \"Human-AI Collaboration and Adaptation Framework (HACAF)\" using a mixed-methods approach. This work revealed that workflow compatibility, rather than perceived usefulness, was the primary driver for early adoption, challenging traditional technology acceptance theories. Building on this, **[li2024voc] AI Tool Use and Adoption in Software Development by Individuals and Organizations: A Grounded Theory Study (2024)** further deepened this understanding. Employing Socio-Technical Grounded Theory, it inductively developed a comprehensive \"Theory of AI Tool Adoption,\" identifying intricate \"push-pull\" relationships between individual and organizational motives and challenges. This methodological progression from controlled experiments to mixed-methods and grounded theory allowed for a more nuanced understanding of the human and organizational factors governing AI integration.\n\nThe scope of inquiry then expanded beyond individual developers and adoption to encompass the broader Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and collaborative ecosystems. **[parikh2023x5m] Empowering Business Transformation: The Positive Impact and Ethical Considerations of Generative AI in Software Product Management - A Systematic Literature Review (2023)** provided a comprehensive systematic literature review, categorizing GAI applications across the entire software product management lifecycle, from idea generation to testing, and critically, introducing a structured discussion of ethical considerations (e.g., hallucinations, intellectual property). This paper highlighted that AI's impact extends far beyond coding and introduced the vital dimension of ethical risks. Concurrently, **[song20241ql] The Impact of Generative AI on Collaborative Open-Source Software Development: Evidence from GitHub Copilot (2024)** shifted the focus to collaborative, project-level outcomes in Open-Source Software (OSS). Using a large-scale quasi-experimental design, it uncovered a dual effect: AI increased project contributions but also, unexpectedly, increased coordination time for code integration, particularly for peripheral developers. This revealed the complex social dynamics introduced by AI in team environments.\n\nFinally, the research trajectory moved towards specializing AI capabilities for critical SDLC phases and directly addressing quality and risk. **[wang2025vty] From Code Generation to Software Testing: AI Copilot With Context-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (2025)** introduced \"Copilot for Testing,\" a concrete technical system leveraging a novel graph-based, context-aware Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) module. This innovation significantly improved bug detection accuracy and test coverage, demonstrating AI's potential to enhance software quality in a specialized domain. Complementing this, **[klemmer20246zk] Using AI Assistants in Software Development: A Qualitative Study on Security Practices and Concerns (2024)** brought the critical issue of security to the forefront. Through qualitative interviews, it provided the first insights into how developers perceive and manage security risks with AI assistants, revealing a paradox of mistrust coupled with widespread use for security-critical tasks. This paper underscored the necessity of understanding human factors in mitigating AI-introduced vulnerabilities.\n\nThis progression illustrates a clear trend: from initial excitement and quantification of individual productivity, the research matured to encompass the complexities of human-AI collaboration, the drivers of adoption, the broad impact across the entire SDLC, and critically, the identification and mitigation of quality and ethical risks, particularly security.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Synthesis\n\nThe unified intellectual trajectory of these works moves from a foundational understanding of AI's individual productivity benefits to a comprehensive exploration of its integration into the entire software development ecosystem, encompassing human-AI collaboration, adoption dynamics, and critical quality and ethical considerations. Collectively, these papers lay the essential empirical and theoretical groundwork for advancing \"AI for Software Development Compliance\" by identifying both the opportunities (e.g., AI-assisted testing for quality standards) and the inherent risks (e.g., AI-generated vulnerabilities, ethical concerns, adoption barriers) that must be addressed to ensure AI-driven development adheres to regulatory and quality standards.",

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review, emphasizing technical innovations and empirical validation:\n\n*   **1. Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   This paper addresses the critical question of how the rise of powerful AI tools, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), will impact the role of human programmers \\cite{alves2023ao6}. It frames this as a potential \"Deep Blue vs. Gary Kasparov moment\" for programming, where AI might replace human effort.\n    *   The problem is important due to the central role of programming in the digital economy and the increasing capabilities of AI in code generation.

Experimental Validation**\n    *   The paper is a position paper and **does not present new experimental validation** of the proposed Centaur Programmer models \\cite{alves2023ao6}.\n    *   It relies on the historical results of Centaur Chess tournaments as an empirical analogy to support its core premise \\cite{alves2023ao6}.\n    *   It references existing studies on the effectiveness of LLM-based tools in programming tasks (e.g., GPT-3's ability to solve exercises, GitHub Copilot's impact on productivity) but does not conduct its own experiments or provide new performance metrics \\cite{alves2023ao6}.\n\n*   **6. Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical limitations:** The proposed collaboration models are conceptual and lack empirical validation within the software development context by the authors \\cite{alves2023ao6}. The core argument heavily relies on an analogy (Centaur Chess) whose direct applicability to the complexities of software development is assumed.\n    *   **Scope of applicability:** The paper's scope is broad, encompassing the future of software development practices, the necessary evolution of university curricula to train \"centaur programmers,\" and the legal/ethical implications of human-AI collaboration in programming \\cite{alves2023ao6}.\n\n*   **7. Technical Significance**\n    *   This work significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing a structured conceptual framework for human-AI collaboration in programming, moving beyond the binary \"replacement vs. no replacement\" debate \\cite{alves2023ao6}. It introduces concrete models for interaction that can guide future tool development.\n    *   Its potential impact on future research is substantial, encouraging:\n        *   The design and implementation of new AI programming tools that explicitly support the proposed collaborative models.\n        *   Research into optimal human-computer interaction (HCI) patterns for augmented programming environments.\n        *   Development of new software engineering methodologies that integrate these collaborative AI roles.\n        *   Further investigation into the ethical and legal frameworks required for AI-assisted code generation, particularly regarding human responsibility for AI-produced content \\cite{alves2023ao6}.",

        "abstract": "This article explores the adoption of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools within the domain of software engineering, focusing on the influencing factors at the individual, technological, and social levels. We applied a convergent mixed-methods approach to offer a comprehensive understanding of AI adoption dynamics. We initially conducted a questionnaire survey with 100 software engineers, drawing upon the Technology Acceptance Model, the Diffusion of Innovation Theory, and the Social Cognitive Theory as guiding theoretical frameworks. Employing the Gioia methodology, we derived a theoretical model of AI adoption in software engineering: the Human-AI Collaboration and Adaptation Framework. This model was then validated using Partial Least Squares–Structural Equation Modeling based on data from 183 software engineers. Findings indicate that at this early stage of AI integration, the compatibility of AI tools within existing development workflows predominantly drives their adoption, challenging conventional technology acceptance theories. The impact of perceived usefulness, social factors, and personal innovativeness seems less pronounced than expected. The study provides crucial insights for future AI tool design and offers a framework for developing effective organizational implementation strategies.",

Objective: This study aimed to explore and capture the practitioners' perception of GenAI adoption in the fast-paced software industry in the context of developing countries. Method: We conducted online focus group discussions with 18 practitioners from various roles to collect qualitative data. The practitioners have an average of 7.8 years of working experience and have used GenAI for over a year. We employed thematic analysis and the Human-AI Collaboration and Adaptation Framework (HACAF) to identify the influencing factors of GenAI adoption, such as awareness, use cases, and challenges. Results: The adoption of GenAI technology is evident from practitioners. We identified 22 practical use cases, three of which were novel, i.e., contextualizing solutions, assisting the internal audit process, and benchmarking the internal software development process. We also discovered seven key challenges associated with the GenAI adoption, two of which were novel, namely, no matching use cases and unforeseen benefits. These challenges slow GenAI adoption and potentially hinder developing countries from entering a high-skill industry.

        "abstract": "The rapid pace of large-scale software development places increasing demands on traditional testing methodologies. We propose a novel perspective on software testing, highlighting the transformative potential of AI-driven technologies in modern software development practices.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** The paper addresses the bottlenecks in efficiency, accuracy, and coverage of traditional software testing methodologies, particularly in the context of rapid, large-scale software development. It frames \"bug detection\" and \"coding with fewer bugs\" as interconnected problems.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** The increasing complexity of systems and the industry's shift towards continuous integration and deployment demand more sophisticated and efficient testing tools. Traditional methods, often manual or semi-automated, struggle to effectively identify bugs and minimize defect rates, leading to inadequate test coverage and impeding the development process \\cite{wang2025vty}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** This work extends previous AI-assisted programming tools (like Copilot for Xcode) that support code auto-completion and Q&A, applying these innovations to software testing. It builds upon advancements in AI-assisted programming, automated software testing (e.g., ML for test case generation), Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE), and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) \\cite{wang2025vty}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:** Traditional testing methods often fall short in addressing the dual challenges of effective bug identification and minimizing bug rates. Existing automated testing solutions still face issues like flaky tests and maintenance challenges, highlighting the need for more robust and intelligent strategies \\cite{wang2025vty}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper introduces \"Copilot for Testing,\" an AI-assisted testing system that synchronizes bug detection, fix suggestions, and automated test case generation with codebase updates directly within the development environment. Its core is a **context-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) module** that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) \\cite{wang2025vty}.\n    *   **Novelty:** The approach models the codebase as a **graph-based representation**, where nodes represent code context embeddings. These embeddings are dynamically updated based on real-time code changes, error patterns, and LLM-generated insights. Factors influencing embeddings include file path, cursor position, file content, bug logs, and graph connectivity. This dynamic, context-aware RAG mechanism allows the system to adapt and refine testing strategies in real-time, providing highly relevant contextual information to the LLMs for prompt construction \\cite{wang2025vty}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Methodology:** A software testing methodology powered by a context-based RAG module that dynamically learns and adapts code context embeddings for enhanced LLM performance \\cite{wang2025vty}.\n    *   **System Design:** Development of \"Copilot for Testing,\" an automated software testing system seamlessly integrated into the development environment, providing real-time bug detection, fix suggestions, and test case generation synchronized with codebase updates \\cite{wang2025vty}.\n    *   **Architectural Innovation:** A graph-based representation of the codebase where nodes are dynamically updated code context embeddings, incorporating multiple factors (e.g., bug logs, graph connectivity) to provide insightful context for LLM prompt generation \\cite{wang2025vty}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** Both objective (quantitative) and subjective (user studies with software engineers) experiments were conducted. Objective evaluations used a curated database of Swift and C++ projects from the Software-artifact Infrastructure Repository (SIR), containing known bugs (\"mutants\") \\cite{wang2025vty}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Results:**\n        *   **Accuracy:** Achieved a **31.2% improvement in bug detection accuracy** compared to a baseline model without the context-based RAG module \\cite{wang2025vty}.\n        *   **Coverage:** Demonstrated a **12.6% increase in critical test coverage**, prioritizing high-impact code areas \\cite{wang2025vty}.\n        *   **Efficiency/User Acceptance:** Showed a **10.5% higher user acceptance rate** for code suggestions in user studies, indicating saved engineering efforts \\cite{wang2025vty}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The paper notes that information propagation in the codebase graph focuses updates on a localized neighborhood with diminishing weight to manage computational overhead. While the initial implementation was in Xcode (a restrictive environment), the framework's design is described as platform-agnostic, relying on modular components adaptable to other IDEs \\cite{wang2025vty}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The system is designed for AI-assisted testing within development environments, focusing on bug detection, fix suggestions, and test case generation synchronized with real-time codebase updates. Its robustness was demonstrated by overcoming challenges in Xcode, suggesting broad applicability to other IDEs \\cite{wang2025vty}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** This work significantly advances AI-driven software testing by offering a unified solution that connects bug detection with code generation, leveraging dynamic context-based RAG to enhance LLM capabilities. It moves beyond traditional AI-assisted programming to provide real-time, intelligent testing support \\cite{wang2025vty}.\n    *   **Potential Impact:** Copilot for Testing has the potential to transform modern software development practices by streamlining the testing process, reducing manual effort, and improving overall software quality through higher accuracy, coverage, and efficiency in bug detection and code generation \\cite{wang2025vty}. Its platform-agnostic design suggests wide applicability across various development environments.",

        "title": "AI Tool Use and Adoption in Software Development by Individuals and Organizations: A Grounded Theory Study",
        "abstract": "AI assistance tools such as ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini have dramatically impacted the nature of software development in recent years. Numerous studies have studied the positive benefits that practitioners have achieved from using these tools in their work. While there is a growing body of knowledge regarding the usability aspects of leveraging AI tools, we still lack concrete details on the issues that organizations and practitioners need to consider should they want to explore increasing adoption or use of AI tools. In this study, we conducted a mixed methods study involving interviews with 26 industry practitioners and 395 survey respondents. We found that there are several motives and challenges that impact individuals and organizations and developed a theory of AI Tool Adoption. For example, we found creating a culture of sharing of AI best practices and tips as a key motive for practitioners' adopting and using AI tools. In total, we identified 2 individual motives, 4 individual challenges, 3 organizational motives, and 3 organizational challenges, and 3 interleaved relationships. The 3 interleaved relationships act in a push-pull manner where motives pull practitioners to increase the use of AI tools and challenges push practitioners away from using AI tools.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \"AI Tool Use and Adoption in Software Development by Individuals and Organizations: A Grounded Theory Study\" \\cite{li2024voc} for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** The paper addresses the lack of concrete details regarding the issues organizations and practitioners face when exploring or increasing the adoption and use of AI assistance tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini) in software development.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** While AI tools have significantly impacted software development and numerous studies highlight their benefits and usability aspects, there is a critical gap in understanding the underlying motives and challenges that influence AI tool adoption at both individual and organizational levels. This lack of clarity hinders organizations from effectively increasing AI tool usage and fully realizing their potential benefits.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** Previous research has primarily focused on the usability of AI tools, their impact on developer productivity, code quality, trust, and ethical considerations \\cite{li2024voc}. Some studies explored how developers perceive and use tools like GitHub Copilot, identifying benefits (e.g., reducing search time) and limitations (e.g., debugging difficulty, code quality issues).\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:** A recent study by Russo \\cite{li2024voc} attempted to model generative AI adoption using established theories (TAM, DOI, SCT) but found several hypotheses unsupported and lacked detailed insights into *how* factors influenced adoption. Overall, existing literature lacked a comprehensive understanding of the roles practitioners and organizations play in adoption, and what specific actions organizations could take to increase AI tool usage. This paper aims to fill this gap by providing deeper, theory-driven insights.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The study employs a mixed-methods approach, primarily utilizing Socio-Technical Grounded Theory (STGT) \\cite{li2024voc}. This iterative research method is well-suited for developing deep understandings from qualitative data in technology-intensive domains like software engineering. The STGT process involved basic data collection and analysis, followed by an advanced stage of theory development, and finally a validation stage.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:** The innovation lies in applying a full STGT methodology, combined with a large-scale validation survey, to develop a novel, empirically grounded theory of AI Tool Adoption. Unlike prior work that often relied on preliminary models or focused on specific aspects (e.g., usability), this study systematically identifies and analyzes a comprehensive set of individual and organizational motives and challenges, and crucially, the interleaved \"push-pull\" relationships between them. It also significantly expands on previous adoption studies by involving a much larger number of participants for validation.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms, Methods, or Techniques:** The primary contribution is the development of a \"Theory of AI Tool Adoption\" grounded in empirical data.\n    *   **System Design or Architectural Innovations:** Not applicable in the traditional sense, as this is a qualitative/mixed-methods study in software engineering research. The innovation is in the *theoretical model* and its empirical derivation.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights or Analysis:**\n        *   Identification and analysis of **2 individual motive factors** that increase AI tool use and adoption.\n        *   Identification and analysis of **4 individual challenge factors** that limit AI tool use and adoption.\n        *   Identification and analysis of **3 organizational motive factors** that increase AI tool use and adoption.\n        *   Identification and analysis of **3 organizational challenge factors** that limit AI tool use and adoption.\n        *   Identification and analysis of **3 interleaved push-pull relationships** between these motives and challenges, explaining how they interact to influence adoption.\n        *   Provision of recommendations for practitioners to navigate these challenges.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** A mixed-methods study was conducted in two main phases:\n        *   **Qualitative Phase:** 26 semi-structured interviews were conducted with diverse software practitioners (e.g., software engineers, DevOps, tech leads) from various organizational sizes and geographic locations, across three iterative rounds of data collection and analysis.\n        *   **Quantitative Validation Phase:** A survey was administered to 395 respondents to validate the theoretical categories and relationships derived from the qualitative phase.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results:** The validation focused on confirming the identified motives, challenges, and their relationships. The paper states that the theory was developed and validated, offering deeper insights into how organizations can support usage and adoption, improving upon previous preliminary models.

However, as a grounded theory study, its findings are context-dependent and may require further validation in different organizational or cultural settings.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The study focuses on AI tool use and adoption in software development by individuals and organizations. The developed theory is applicable to understanding and guiding strategies for increasing AI tool adoption within this domain.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** This study significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in software engineering research by providing a novel, empirically grounded theory of AI tool adoption. It moves beyond descriptive studies of usability or productivity to offer a comprehensive, actionable framework of interacting factors influencing adoption.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:** The identified motives, challenges, and their push-pull relationships provide a robust foundation for future research.

        "title": "The Impact of Generative AI on Collaborative Open-Source Software Development: Evidence from GitHub Copilot",
        "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) enables automated content production, including coding in software development, which can significantly influence developer participation and performance. To explore its impact on collaborative open-source software (OSS) development, we investigate the role of GitHub Copilot, a generative AI pair programmer, in OSS development where multiple distributed developers voluntarily collaborate. Using GitHub's proprietary Copilot usage data, combined with public OSS repository data obtained from GitHub, we find that Copilot use increases project-level code contributions by 5.9%. This gain is driven by a 2.1% increase in individual code contributions and a 3.4% rise in developer coding participation. However, these benefits come at a cost as coordination time for code integration increases by 8% due to more code discussions enabled by AI pair programmers. This reveals an important tradeoff: While AI expands who can contribute and how much they contribute, it slows coordination in collective development efforts. Despite this tension, the combined effect of these two competing forces remains positive, indicating a net gain in overall project-level productivity from using AI pair programmers. Interestingly, we also find the effects differ across developer roles. Peripheral developers show relatively smaller gains in project-level code contributions and face a higher increase in coordination time than core developers, likely due to the difference in their project familiarity. In summary, our study underscores the dual role of AI pair programmers in affecting project-level code contributions and coordination time in OSS development. Our findings on the differential effects between core and peripheral developers also provide important implications for the structure of OSS communities in the long run.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review, emphasizing technical innovations and empirical validation:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper investigates the impact of generative AI (specifically AI pair programmers like GitHub Copilot) on collaborative open-source software (OSS) development, focusing on project-level code contributions and coordination time for code integration \\cite{song20241ql}.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: This problem is crucial because generative AI is transforming content production, including coding, but its role in complex, team-based, and voluntarily collaborative environments like OSS is poorly understood. Challenges include:\n        *   Translating individual productivity gains to project-level outcomes, which involve both individual contribution intensity and developer participation.\n        *   Understanding how AI affects coordination efficiency in decentralized OSS settings, where coordination is informal and fluid.\n        *   Identifying differential impacts on distinct developer roles (core vs. peripheral) given their varying project familiarity, which differs from skill-based heterogeneity studied previously.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Prior work primarily focused on generative AI's impact on individual developer productivity for discrete tasks (e.g., faster coding, fewer errors) \\cite{song20241ql}. Some studies explored AI's effect on participation in Q&A communities (often showing a reduction) or coordination in fixed-size teams with formal processes.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   Limited understanding of generative AI's influence on *project-level* outcomes in complex, collaborative tasks involving multiple developers.\n        *   Lack of clarity on how AI affects *voluntary participation* in OSS, which differs from information exchange communities.\n        *   Insufficient research on how AI shapes *coordination time* in fluid, decentralized OSS teams, especially regarding the integration of heterogeneous contributions.\n        *   Previous heterogeneity studies focused on skill levels; they did not address the distinction between core and peripheral developers based on *project familiarity* in OSS.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The study employs a quasi-experimental design using the Generalized Synthetic Control Method (GSCM) to estimate the causal impact of GitHub Copilot adoption on OSS projects \\cite{song20241ql}. This method constructs a synthetic control group from untreated repositories to mimic the pre-treatment trends of treated repositories, allowing for robust causal inference in an observational setting.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   **Empirical Scope**: It's among the first to analyze the impact of generative AI on *project-level* outcomes (contributions and coordination) in *collaborative OSS development*, moving beyond individual task performance.\n        *   **Data Integration**: Leverages a unique combination of proprietary GitHub Copilot usage data and public GitHub OSS repository data, providing a rich, real-world dataset for analysis.\n        *   **Focus on Coordination**: Explicitly investigates coordination time for code integration, an understudied aspect of AI's impact in collaborative environments.\n        *   **Developer Role Heterogeneity**: Examines the differential effects on core versus peripheral developers, introducing \"project familiarity\" as a key moderating factor, contrasting with prior skill-based analyses.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Methods/Techniques**: Application of the Generalized Synthetic Control Method (GSCM) to a complex, large-scale observational dataset of OSS projects to infer causal effects of generative AI adoption.\n    *   **Empirical Insights**:\n        *   Demonstrates a dual effect of AI pair programmers: increasing project-level code contributions while simultaneously increasing coordination time for integration \\cite{song20241ql}.\n        *   Uncovers that AI encourages *more participation* in OSS development (both coding and non-coding discussions), contrasting with findings from Q&A communities.\n        *   Reveals that the increase in coordination time is driven by a higher volume, broader participation, and greater intensity of code discussions.\n        *   Identifies a significant heterogeneity: peripheral developers experience smaller gains in contributions and a larger increase in coordination time compared to core developers, attributed to differences in project familiarity.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: A quasi-experimental study analyzing GitHub Copilot adoption in OSS repositories over a sample period from January 2021 to December 2022 \\cite{song20241ql}.\n    *   **Data**: Proprietary GitHub Copilot usage data combined with publicly available OSS repository data from GitHub. The unit of analysis is repository-month.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**:\n        *   Project-level code contributions (e.g., number of commits, lines of code).\n        *   Individual code contributions and developer coding participation.\n        *   Coordination time for code integration (time to merge pull requests).\n        *   Metrics related to code discussions (volume, breadth of participants, intensity).\n    *   **Comparison Results**:\n        *   Copilot use is associated with a **5.9% increase** in project-level code contributions.\n        *   This gain is driven by a **2.1% increase** in individual code contributions and a **3.4% rise** in developer coding participation.\n        *   However, coordination time for code integration increases by **8%**.\n        *   The net effect on overall project-level productivity (contributions with timely integration) remains positive.\n        *   Peripheral developers show relatively smaller gains in project-level code contributions and face a higher increase in coordination time than core developers.\n    *   **Robustness**: Results are validated through alternative matching techniques and a comprehensive set of robustness checks.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: While GSCM is robust for causal inference in observational studies, it relies on the assumption that the synthetic control adequately represents the counterfactual. The study focuses on GitHub Copilot, and findings may not directly generalize to all generative AI tools or other development platforms.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The findings are specific to collaborative open-source software development on GitHub. Generalizability to proprietary software development or other forms of online collaboration might require further investigation. The paper also notes that generative AI tools have \"limited ability... to learn the project’s full context,\" which influences their effectiveness for peripheral developers \\cite{song20241ql}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**:\n        *   Provides novel empirical evidence that generative AI can *increase* voluntary participation in OSS (both coding and non-coding activities), challenging prior findings from Q&A communities \\cite{song20241ql}.\n        *   Uncovers an unexpected impact: AI tools, by encouraging more discussion, can *increase coordination time* in team-based collaboration, extending the understanding of AI's role beyond simple convergence.\n        *   Offers a new perspective on heterogeneity, demonstrating that in complex tasks requiring contextual knowledge, peripheral developers (with lower project familiarity) may gain *less* productivity from AI pair programmers than core developers, contrasting with skill-based findings.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: The study highlights the dual nature of AI in collaborative development, prompting further research into optimizing the balance between contribution gains and coordination overhead. It also opens avenues for exploring how AI tools could be designed to better support developers with varying levels of project familiarity and contextual knowledge, potentially influencing the long-term structure and dynamics of OSS communities.",

        "abstract": "Following the recent release of AI assistants, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, the software industry quickly utilized these tools for software development tasks, e.g., generating code or consulting AI for advice. While recent research has demonstrated that AI-generated code can contain security issues, how software professionals balance AI assistant usage and security remains unclear. This paper investigates how software professionals use AI assistants in secure software development, what security implications and considerations arise, and what impact they foresee on security in software development. We conducted 27 semi-structured interviews with software professionals, including software engineers, team leads, and security testers. We also reviewed 190 relevant Reddit posts and comments to gain insights into the current discourse surrounding AI assistants for software development. Our analysis of the interviews and Reddit posts finds that, despite many security and quality concerns, participants widely use AI assistants for security-critical tasks, e.g., code generation, threat modeling, and vulnerability detection. Participants' overall mistrust leads to checking AI suggestions in similar ways to human code. However, they expect improvements and, therefore, a heavier use of AI for security tasks in the future. We conclude with recommendations for software professionals to critically check AI suggestions, for AI creators to improve suggestion security and capabilities for ethical security tasks, and for academic researchers to consider general-purpose AI in software development.",

This implies a chain, but only one paper is provided. I cannot show evolution *between* papers. Instead, I must interpret this as analyzing the *contribution of this single paper within its domain*, positioning it relative to the *prior state of the art as described within the paper itself*. The \"evolution\" will be from the problems identified in the existing landscape *to* the solution offered by MONAI.\n2.  **Topic Mismatch:** The requested research area is \"AI for Software Development Compliance\". The provided paper, \"[cardoso2022a89] MONAI: An open-source framework for deep learning in healthcare (2022)\", is explicitly about \"deep learning in healthcare\". These topics are distinct. I must acknowledge this mismatch in the analysis, particularly in the \"Synthesis\" section, as I cannot connect the paper's content to the requested domain.\n\n**Strategy for Analysis:**\n\n*   **Evolution Analysis:** I will frame the analysis around a single \"trend\" that describes the shift MONAI represents within the healthcare AI domain. This trend will detail how MONAI addresses the limitations of general-purpose and fragmented healthcare-specific deep learning frameworks.\n    *   *Methodological progression*: Describe the shift from general-purpose DL frameworks and fragmented domain-specific ones to MONAI's unified, PyTorch-native, domain-optimized approach.\n    *   *Problem evolution*: Explain how MONAI tackles the lack of domain-specific functionality, fragmentation, and challenges of medical data processing that previous solutions failed to fully address.\n    *   *Key innovations*: Highlight MONAI's specific technical contributions (transforms, architecture, development model).\n*   **Synthesis:** I will explicitly state that the provided paper does not align with \"AI for Software Development Compliance\". I will then summarize MONAI's actual contribution within its own domain (healthcare AI).\n\n**Detailed Plan for Evolution Analysis (for a single paper):**\n\n*   **How many distinct methodological or conceptual shifts occur?**\n    *   Shift 1: From general-purpose DL frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow) lacking domain-specific functionality for healthcare to a specialized, extended framework.\n    *   Shift 2: From a fragmented ecosystem of academic and industry-specific healthcare DL frameworks to a unified, open-source, community-supported framework.\n    *   Shift 3: A conceptual shift towards embedding domain-awareness (medical data particularities like geometry, physiology, physics) directly into the framework's core components.\n\n*   **What specific problems does each new paper address that previous papers left unsolved or unexplored?**\n    *   **Problem 1 (unsolved by general frameworks):** General DL frameworks necessitate significant custom development for healthcare, increasing R&D risks and timelines due to their lack of domain-specific functionality for unique medical data (e.g., DICOM, high-dimensional arrays, physical interpretations).\n    *   **Problem 2 (unsolved by previous healthcare-specific frameworks):** The proliferation of disparate healthcare-specific frameworks led to a fragmented software ecosystem, hindering collaboration, standardization, and leading to diluted development efforts and reduced code quality.\n    *   **Problem 3 (unexplored/inadequately addressed):** The need for AI models in clinical use to be safe, reproducible, and robust, which requires the underlying software framework to explicitly account for the complexities and specific requirements of medical data.\n\n*   **What innovations or capabilities does each subsequent paper introduce?** (Here, \"subsequent paper\" refers to MONAI itself, relative to its predecessors in the field).\n    *   **PyTorch-native Design:** Ensures minimal learning curve and seamless integration.\n    *   **Opt-in and Incremental Adoption:** Allows users to gradually integrate MONAI components.\n    *   **Domain-Specific Components:** Purpose-specific AI model architectures, transformations, and utilities tailored for medical data.\n    *   **Unification:** Aims to standardize best practices and foster collaboration.\n    *   **Comprehensive Medical Image Transforms:** Rich set of I/O, spatial, intensity, cropping/padding, and physics-specific transforms (e.g., `RandKSpaceSpikeNoise`).\n    *   **Invertible Transforms:** Crucial for TTA, augmentation-consistency, and preserving original geometry.\n    *   **Array and Dictionary Transforms:** Flexible pipelines for consistent augmentation across paired data.\n    *   **Modular Architecture:** Clear separation of concerns (`monai.data`, `monai.losses`, etc.).\n    *   **Consortium-Led Development:** Collaborative initiative ensuring broad input and adoption.\n\n*   **Are there temporal gaps or clusters that suggest external influences?**\n    *   The paper is from 2022. It builds upon the maturity of general DL frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch) and addresses the fragmentation observed in earlier healthcare-specific frameworks. The timing suggests a growing need for robust, standardized, and reproducible AI in healthcare, driven by increasing clinical adoption and the demand for higher quality, safer AI systems. This implies an external influence of the increasing maturity and application of AI in the medical field, highlighting the need for specialized tooling.\n\nThis detailed plan allows me to address all parts of the prompt, including the challenges of a single paper and the topic mismatch, within the requested structure.",

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**1. Research Problem & Motivation**\n\n*   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the critical need for large-scale, diverse, and richly annotated datasets to accelerate research in \"AI for Code\" – leveraging AI techniques to improve software development efficiency.\n*   **Importance and Challenge**: Software development productivity and modernization of legacy applications are crucial. While AI has seen breakthroughs in other domains (vision, NLP), its application to code is hampered by the lack of high-quality, extensive datasets comparable to those in other fields (e.g., ImageNet). Existing datasets are often limited in scale, language diversity, or metadata, making it challenging to train robust AI models for complex coding tasks.\n\n**2. Related Work & Positioning**\n\n*   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: The work relates to existing datasets like POJ-104 \\cite{puri2021d34} and GCJ \\cite{puri2021d34}, which also provide code samples for various tasks (clone detection, vulnerability detection, code completion, etc.).\n*   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n    *   **POJ-104**: Limited scale (52,000 samples), restricted to C/C++ (often mixed), lacks crucial metadata (judging results, problem statements, execution info), and contains identical problems/near-duplicates without explicit identification.\n    *   **GCJ**: Larger than POJ-104 (2.43 million samples) and more language-diverse, but still lacks comprehensive metadata (e.g., problem statements, test data), and does not provide information on identical problems or near-duplicates.\n    *   **General**: Many existing datasets are task-specific, whereas CodeNet aims for broad applicability.\n\n**3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n\n*   **Core Technical Method**: CodeNet is constructed by scraping and curating data from two online judge websites (AIZU and AtCoder), unifying their formats, and applying rigorous cleansing and annotation processes.\n*   **Novelty/Differentiation**:\n    *   **Unprecedented Scale and Diversity**: Over 14 million code samples, 500 million lines of code, in 55 programming languages, making it the largest dataset of its kind.\n    *   **Rich, High-Quality Annotations**: Includes detailed metadata for each submission (status like Accepted, Wrong Answer, TLE, MLE; CPU time, memory usage, code size), problem descriptions, and sample input/output test sets for 98.5% of samples.\n    *   **Data Cleansing and Quality Control**: Employs Jaccard similarity (set and multiset) to identify and flag near-duplicate code samples (thresholds 0.9 and 0.8 respectively) and uses `fdupes` combined with near-duplicate code analysis and clustering to detect identical problems.\n    *   **Usability Features**: Provides pre-processing tools (fast C implementations of tokenizers for C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, and parse-tree generators) to transform source code into readily usable representations for ML models.\n    *   **Support for Diverse Tasks**: Designed to support a wide range of tasks including code similarity, classification, translation, and performance improvement (runtime/memory prediction).\n\n**4. Key Technical Contributions**\n\n*   **Novel Dataset**: The CodeNet dataset itself, characterized by its massive scale, linguistic diversity (55 languages), and rich, high-quality metadata (submission status, performance metrics, problem descriptions, I/O test cases).\n*   **Advanced Data Cleansing**: Introduction and application of a systematic approach for identifying and flagging near-duplicate code samples (using Jaccard similarity on tokenized code) and identical problems (using `fdupes` and code-level near-duplicate analysis), which is crucial for robust ML model training.\n*   **Pre-processing Toolchain**: Provision of open-source tools for tokenization and parse-tree generation, enabling researchers to easily convert raw code into ML-ready representations.\n*   **Benchmarking Capabilities**: The dataset's structure and metadata enable the creation of customized benchmark datasets (e.g., C++, Python, Java subsets) for various AI for Code tasks.\n\n**5. Experimental Validation**\n\n*   **Experiments Conducted**: The paper mentions conducting baseline experiments for code classification and code similarity using the CodeNet dataset.\n*   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**: While specific detailed results or comparative metrics are not provided in the abstract or introduction, the paper states that \"Results of code classiﬁcation and code similarity experiments using the CodeNet dataset are provided as a reference\" and \"Section 8 describes important baseline experiments.\" This indicates that the dataset's utility for these tasks has been demonstrated through initial experiments, serving as a reference for future research.\n\n**6. Limitations & Scope**\n\n*   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**:\n    *   Code samples may not be extensively commented, and comments can be in multiple languages, posing challenges for AI techniques relying heavily on comments.\n    *   The dataset primarily consists of solutions to high-school and beginning college-level programming problems.\n*   **Scope of Applicability**:\n    *   Not suitable for tasks requiring code with enterprise APIs or advanced design patterns.\n    *   Primarily focused on pedagogical and competitive programming contexts.\n\n**7. Technical Significance**\n\n*   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: CodeNet significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in AI for Code by providing an unprecedentedly large, diverse, and richly annotated dataset. This addresses a major bottleneck in the field, enabling the development and evaluation of more sophisticated deep learning models.\n*   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n    *   **Accelerates Algorithmic Advances**: Expected to accelerate research in AI techniques for a wide variety of critical coding tasks (e.g., code translation, performance prediction, error prediction, code generation).\n    *   **Enables New Research Directions**: The rich metadata (runtime, memory, correctness status, I/O tests) opens up new research avenues, such as reinforcement learning for code quality improvement or fine-grained performance prediction.\n    *   **Standardization**: Aims to become a foundational resource, similar to ImageNet for computer vision, fostering standardized benchmarking and comparison of AI for Code models.\n\n---\n\n2. *Evolution Analysis:*\n\nThe analysis of the provided paper, \"[puri2021d34] CodeNet: A Large-Scale AI for Code Dataset for Learning a Diversity of Coding Tasks (2021)\", reveals a significant trend in the \"AI for Code\" research landscape: the critical shift towards **foundational, large-scale, and richly annotated datasets** to enable advanced AI applications in software development.\n\n*Trend 1: The Drive for Foundational, Large-Scale, and Richly Annotated Datasets for AI for Code*\n\n*   *Methodological progression*: The field of AI for Code, much like other AI domains, recognized the indispensable role of vast, high-quality datasets for training robust machine learning models. Prior to CodeNet, existing datasets like POJ-104 and GCJ, while valuable, were limited in their scope and depth. POJ-104, for instance, offered a modest 52,000 samples primarily in C/C++, lacking crucial metadata and suffering from unaddressed duplicates. GCJ expanded the scale to 2.43 million samples and increased language diversity but still fell short on comprehensive metadata and duplicate identification. The methodological progression seen in [puri2021d34] is a deliberate move from these more constrained, often task-specific, data collections to a unified, meticulously curated, and universally applicable dataset. CodeNet's construction involved a systematic approach of scraping, unifying formats from diverse online judge platforms, and applying rigorous data cleansing and annotation pipelines. This represents a methodological shift from opportunistic data collection to a strategic, engineered approach to dataset creation.\n\n*   *Problem evolution*: The primary problem addressed by [puri2021d34] is the fundamental bottleneck in AI for Code research: the lack of a dataset comparable in scale, diversity, and richness to those that catalyzed breakthroughs in computer vision (e.g., ImageNet) and natural language processing. Previous solutions, such as POJ-104 and GCJ, left several critical problems unsolved. They lacked the sheer volume of code samples necessary for deep learning models to generalize effectively. More importantly, they lacked the rich, granular metadata—such as submission status (Accepted, Wrong Answer), execution time, memory usage, and corresponding problem descriptions with input/output test cases—that is vital for training AI models to understand not just syntax but also semantics, correctness, and performance characteristics of code. Furthermore, the presence of identical or near-duplicate code samples and problems in prior datasets posed a significant challenge for model evaluation, leading to inflated performance metrics. CodeNet directly tackles these problems by providing unprecedented scale, comprehensive metadata, and advanced data cleansing to identify and flag duplicates.\n\n*   *Key innovations*: [puri2021d34] introduces several breakthrough contributions that enable new capabilities in AI for Code. The most significant innovation is the **CodeNet dataset itself**, boasting over 14 million code samples across 55 programming languages, making it the largest and most linguistically diverse dataset of its kind. This scale alone opens doors for training more powerful and generalizable AI models. Complementing this scale is the **rich, high-quality annotation**, including detailed submission statuses, performance metrics, problem descriptions, and I/O test cases, which allows for the development of AI models that can predict not just code functionality but also its efficiency and correctness. Another crucial innovation is the **advanced data cleansing methodology**, employing Jaccard similarity for near-duplicate code detection and `fdupes` for identifying identical problems. This ensures the integrity and utility of the dataset for robust model training and fair benchmarking. Finally, the provision of **open-source pre-processing tools** for tokenization and parse-tree generation significantly lowers the barrier for researchers to utilize CodeNet, transforming raw code into ML-ready representations and fostering broader adoption and experimentation. These innovations collectively establish CodeNet as a foundational resource, poised to accelerate algorithmic advances across a wide spectrum of coding tasks.\n\n3. *Synthesis*\n\nThe unified intellectual trajectory connecting this work is the foundational effort to provide the necessary data infrastructure for advancing AI's application to software development. CodeNet's collective contribution to \"AI for Software Development Compliance\" is indirect but profound: by enabling the training of more sophisticated and robust AI models that understand code semantics, correctness, and performance, it lays the groundwork for future systems capable of automatically identifying, predicting, and even correcting code that violates compliance standards, security policies, or best practices.",

        "abstract": "Over the last several decades, software has been woven into the fabric of every aspect of our society. As software development surges and code infrastructure of enterprise applications ages, it is now more critical than ever to increase software development productivity and modernize legacy applications. Advances in deep learning and machine learning algorithms have enabled numerous breakthroughs, motivating researchers to leverage AI techniques to improve software development efficiency. Thus, the fast-emerging research area of AI for Code has garnered new interest and gathered momentum. In this paper, we present a large-scale dataset CodeNet, consisting of over 14 million code samples and about 500 million lines of code in 55 different programming languages, which is aimed at teaching AI to code. In addition to its large scale, CodeNet has a rich set of high-quality annotations to benchmark and help accelerate research in AI techniques for a variety of critical coding tasks, including code similarity and classification, code translation between a large variety of programming languages, and code performance (runtime and memory) improvement techniques. Additionally, CodeNet provides sample input and output test sets for 98.5% of the code samples, which can be used as an oracle for determining code correctness and potentially guide reinforcement learning for code quality improvements. As a usability feature, we provide several pre-processing tools in CodeNet to transform source code into representations that can be readily used as inputs into machine learning models. Results of code classification and code similarity experiments using the CodeNet dataset are provided as a reference. We hope that the scale, diversity and rich, high-quality annotations of CodeNet will offer unprecedented research opportunities at the intersection of AI and Software Engineering.",

Prior to this work, significant effort had been dedicated to articulating high-level AI ethics principles. However, this paper argues for a necessary evolution *beyond* these abstract principles, proposing a move towards a comprehensive \"toolbox\" of concrete, actionable, and *verifiable mechanisms*. This progression emphasizes the need for *falsifiable claims* about AI systems and their development processes, supported by tangible evidence, rather than mere adherence to non-binding guidelines. The methodology shifts from a normative, principle-based approach to a sociotechnical framework that integrates institutional, software, and hardware solutions to enable external scrutiny and accountability.\n\n-   *Problem evolution*: The primary problem addressed by \"[brundage2020dn4] Toward Trustworthy AI Development: Mechanisms for Supporting Verifiable Claims (2020)\" is the critical gap between the widespread adoption of AI ethics principles and the actual ability to ensure and demonstrate responsible AI development. The paper highlights that existing high-level ethics principles, while important, are often vague, non-binding, and lack mechanisms for independent monitoring or enforcement. This deficiency leads to a trust deficit, accusations of \"ethics washing,\" and makes it difficult for external stakeholders (e.g., users, regulators, civil society) to assess developer claims effectively. The paper tackles the challenge of moving beyond abstract ideals to concrete, auditable practices that can substantiate claims about an AI system's safety, security, fairness, and privacy protection.\n\n-   *Key innovations*: The core innovation of \"[brundage2020dn4] Toward Trustworthy AI Development: Mechanisms for Supporting Verifiable Claims (2020)\" lies in its systematic articulation and categorization of diverse mechanisms specifically designed to enable *verifiable claims* and *external scrutiny*. Key technical contributions include:\n    *   **Software-level innovations**: Recommending requirements for **audit trails** in safety-critical AI to capture lifecycle information, advocating for **interpretability methods** focused on supporting risk assessment and auditing, and calling for the development and sharing of **Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) tool suites** with performance measures against common standards.\n    *   **Hardware-level innovations**: Proposing the development of **secure hardware features for ML accelerators** or best practices for using secure enclaves to enhance privacy and security verifiability, and recommending **high-precision compute measurement** for transparency in resource usage.\n    *   **Institutional innovations**: Suggesting mechanisms like **third-party auditing, red teaming exercises, bias and safety bounties, and sharing of AI incidents**.\n    These innovations collectively provide a structured, sociotechnical framework for bridging the gap between abstract ethical guidelines and concrete, actionable steps for demonstrating trustworthiness, thereby enabling new capabilities for accountability and transparency in AI development.\n\n3. *Synthesis*\n\"[brundage2020dn4] Toward Trustworthy AI Development: Mechanisms for Supporting Verifiable Claims (2020)\" establishes a foundational intellectual trajectory by shifting the focus from abstract AI ethics principles to the operationalization of trustworthiness through concrete, verifiable mechanisms.

In order for AI developers to earn trust from system users, customers, civil society, governments, and other stakeholders that they are building AI responsibly, they will need to make verifiable claims to which they can be held accountable. Those outside of a given organization also need effective means of scrutinizing such claims. This report suggests various steps that different stakeholders can take to improve the verifiability of claims made about AI systems and their associated development processes, with a focus on providing evidence about the safety, security, fairness, and privacy protection of AI systems. We analyze ten mechanisms for this purpose--spanning institutions, software, and hardware--and make recommendations aimed at implementing, exploring, or improving those mechanisms.",
