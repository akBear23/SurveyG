        "abstract": "Multi-scale Vision Transformer (ViT) has emerged as a powerful backbone for computer vision tasks, while the self-attention computation in Transformer scales quadratically w.r.t. the input patch number. Thus, existing solutions commonly employ down-sampling operations (e.g., average pooling) over keys/values to dramatically reduce the computational cost. In this work, we argue that such over-aggressive down-sampling design is not invertible and inevitably causes information dropping especially for high-frequency components in objects (e.g., texture details). Motivated by the wavelet theory, we construct a new Wavelet Vision Transformer (\\textbf{Wave-ViT}) that formulates the invertible down-sampling with wavelet transforms and self-attention learning in a unified way. This proposal enables self-attention learning with lossless down-sampling over keys/values, facilitating the pursuing of a better efficiency-vs-accuracy trade-off. Furthermore, inverse wavelet transforms are leveraged to strengthen self-attention outputs by aggregating local contexts with enlarged receptive field. We validate the superiority of Wave-ViT through extensive experiments over multiple vision tasks (e.g., image recognition, object detection and instance segmentation). Its performances surpass state-of-the-art ViT backbones with comparable FLOPs. Source code is available at \\url{https://github.com/YehLi/ImageNetModel}.",

        "abstract": "The vision transformer (ViT) with global self-attention exhibits quadratic computational complexity that depends on the image size. To address this issue, window-based self-attention ViT limits attention area to a specific window, thereby mitigating the computational complexity. However, it cannot effectively capture the relationships between windows. The Swin Transformer, a representative window-based self-attention ViT, introduces shifted-window multi-head self-attention (SW-MSA) to capture the cross-window information. However, SW-MSA groups tokens that are close to each other in the image into one window and thus cannot capture relationships between distant tokens. Therefore, this paper introduces a feature-space window attention transformer (FSwin Transformer) that includes distant but similar tokens in one window. The proposed FSwin Transformer clusters similar tokens based on the feature space and conducts self-attention within the cluster. Thus, this approach helps understand the global context of the image by compensating for interactions between long-distance tokens, which cannot be captured when windows are set based on the image space. In addition, we incorporate a feature-space refinement method with channel and spatial attention to emphasize key parts and suppress non-essential parts. The refined feature map improves the representation power of the model, resulting in improved classification performance. Consequently, in classification tasks for ImageNet-1K, FSwin Transformer outperforms existing Transformer-based backbones, including the Swin Transformer.",

The large, sometimes even global, receptive field endows Transformer models with higher representation power over their CNN counterparts. Nevertheless, simply enlarging receptive field also gives rise to several concerns. On the one hand, using dense attention e.g., in ViT, leads to excessive memory and computational cost, and features can be influenced by irrelevant parts which are beyond the region of interests. On the other hand, the sparse attention adopted in PVT or Swin Transformer is data agnostic and may limit the ability to model long range relations. To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel deformable selfattention module, where the positions of key and value pairs in selfattention are selected in a data-dependent way. This flexible scheme enables the self-attention module to focus on relevant re-gions and capture more informative features. On this basis, we present Deformable Attention Transformer, a general backbone model with deformable attention for both image classification and dense prediction tasks.

However, these models have considerable storage and computational overheads, making their deployment and efficient inference on edge devices challenging. Quantization is a promising approach to reducing model complexity, and the dyadic arithmetic pipeline can allow the quantized models to perform efficient integer-only inference. Unfortunately, dyadic arithmetic is based on the homogeneity condition in convolutional neural networks, which is not applicable to the non-linear components in ViTs, making integer-only inference of ViTs an open issue. In this paper, we propose I-ViT, an integer-only quantization scheme for ViTs, to enable ViTs to perform the entire computational graph of inference with integer arithmetic and bit-shifting, and without any floating-point arithmetic. In I-ViT, linear operations (e.g., MatMul and Dense) follow the integer-only pipeline with dyadic arithmetic, and non-linear operations (e.g., Softmax, GELU, and LayerNorm) are approximated by the proposed light-weight integer-only arithmetic methods. More specifically, I-ViT applies the proposed Shiftmax and ShiftGELU, which are designed to use integer bit-shifting to approximate the corresponding floating-point operations. We evaluate I-ViT on various benchmark models and the results show that integer-only INT8 quantization achieves comparable (or even slightly higher) accuracy to the full-precision (FP) baseline. Furthermore, we utilize TVM for practical hardware deployment on the GPU\u2019s integer arithmetic units, achieving 3.72 ~ 4.11 inference speedup compared to the FP model.

The agriculture industry is negatively impacted by plant diseases causing crop and economic loss. Accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial for managing and controlling plant diseases, as traditional methods can be costly and time-consuming. Deep learning-based tools effectively detect plant diseases depending on the qualitative of extracted features. In this regard, a hybrid model for plant disease classification based on a Transfer Learning-based model followed by a vision transformer (TLMViT) is proposed. TLMViT has four stages: 1) data acquisition, where the PlantVillage and wheat datasets are used to train and evaluate the proposed model, 2) image augmentation to increase the number of training samples and overcome the overfitting issue, 3) leaf feature extraction by two consecutive phases: initial features extraction by using pre-trained based model and deep features extraction by using ViT model, and 4) classification by using MLP classifier. TLMViT is experimented with using five pre-trained-based models followed by ViT individually. TLMViT performs accurately in plant disease classification, obtaining 98.81% and 99.86% validation accuracy for VGG19 followed by the ViT model on PlantVillage and wheat datasets respectively. Moreover, TLMViT is compared with pre-trained-based architecture. The comparison result illustrates that TLMViT achieved an enhancement of 1.11% and 1.099% in validation accuracy, 2.576% and 2.92% in validation loss compared with the transfer learning-based model for PlantVillage and wheat datasets respectively.

However, ViT models suffer from substantial computational and memory requirements, making it challenging to deploy them on resource-constrained platforms. Quantization is a popular approach for reducing model size, but most studies mainly focus on equal bit-width quantization for the entire network, resulting in sub-optimal solutions. While there are few works on mixed precision quantization (MPQ) for ViTs, they typically rely on search space-based methods or employ mixed precision arbitrarily. In this paper, we introduce LRP-QViT, an explainability-based method for assigning mixed-precision bit allocations to different layers based on their importance during classification. Specifically, to measure the contribution score of each layer in predicting the target class, we employ the Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) method. LRP assigns local relevance at the output layer and propagates it through all layers, distributing the relevance until it reaches the input layers. These relevance scores serve as indicators for computing the layer contribution score. Additionally, we have introduced a clipped channel-wise quantization aimed at eliminating outliers from post-LayerNorm activations to alleviate severe inter-channel variations. To validate and assess our approach, we employ LRP-QViT across ViT, DeiT, and Swin transformer models on various datasets. Our experimental findings demonstrate that both our fixed-bit and mixed-bit post-training quantization methods surpass existing models in the context of 4-bit and 6-bit quantization.",

Thus, this paper directly treats the TensorRT latency on the specific hardware as an efficiency metric, which provides more comprehensive feedback involving computational capacity, memory cost, and bandwidth. Based on a series of controlled experiments, this work derives four practical guidelines for TensorRT-oriented and deployment-friendly network design, e.g., early CNN and late Transformer at stage-level, early Transformer and late CNN at block-level. Accordingly, a family of TensortRT-oriented Transformers is presented, abbreviated as TRT-ViT. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TRT-ViT significantly outperforms existing ConvNets and vision Transformers with respect to the latency/accuracy trade-off across diverse visual tasks, e.g., image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation. For example, at 82.7% ImageNet-1k top-1 accuracy, TRT-ViT is 2.7$\\times$ faster than CSWin and 2.0$\\times$ faster than Twins.

        "abstract": "Vision Transformers achieved outstanding performance in many computer vision tasks. Early Vision Transformers such as ViT and DeiT adopt global self-attention, which is computationally expensive when the number of patches is large. To improve efficiency, recent Vision Transformers adopt local self-attention mechanisms, where self-attention is computed within local windows. Despite the fact that window-based local self-attention significantly boosts efficiency, it fails to capture the relationships between distant but similar patches in the image plane. To overcome this limitation of image-space local attention, in this paper, we further exploit the locality of patches in the feature space. We group the patches into multiple clusters using their features, and self-attention is computed within every cluster. Such feature-space local attention effectively captures the connections between patches across different local windows but still relevant. We propose a Bilateral lOcal Attention vision Transformer (BOAT), which integrates feature-space local attention with image-space local attention. We further integrate BOAT with both Swin and CSWin models, and extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our BOAT-CSWin model clearly and consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art CNN models and vision Transformers.",

Among the powerful compression approaches, quantization extremely reduces the computation and memory consumption by low-bit parameters and bit-wise operations. However, low-bit ViTs remain largely unexplored and usually suffer from a significant performance drop compared with the real-valued counterparts. In this work, through extensive empirical analysis, we first identify the bottleneck for severe performance drop comes from the information distortion of the low-bit quantized self-attention map. We then develop an information rectification module (IRM) and a distribution guided distillation (DGD) scheme for fully quantized vision transformers (Q-ViT) to effectively eliminate such distortion, leading to a fully quantized ViTs. We evaluate our methods on popular DeiT and Swin backbones. Extensive experimental results show that our method achieves a much better performance than the prior arts. For example, our Q-ViT can theoretically accelerates the ViT-S by 6.14x and achieves about 80.9% Top-1 accuracy, even surpassing the full-precision counterpart by 1.0% on ImageNet dataset.

Gait is one of the most reliable biometrics due to its advantages, such as being perceivable at a long distance and difficult to replicate. The existing works mostly leverage Convolutional Neural Networks for gait recognition. The Convolutional Neural Networks perform well in image recognition tasks; however, they lack the attention mechanism to emphasize more on the significant regions of the image. The attention mechanism encodes information in the image patches, which facilitates the model to learn the substantial features in the specific regions. In light of this, this work employs the Vision Transformer (ViT) with an attention mechanism for gait recognition, referred to as Gait-ViT. In the proposed Gait-ViT, the gait energy image is first obtained by averaging the series of images over the gait cycle. The images are then split into patches and transformed into sequences by flattening and patch embedding. Position embedding, along with patch embedding, are applied on the sequence of patches to restore the positional information of the patches. Subsequently, the sequence of vectors is fed to the Transformer encoder to produce the final gait representation. As for the classification, the first element of the sequence is sent to the multi-layer perceptron to predict the class label. The proposed method obtained 99.93% on CASIA-B, 100% on OU-ISIR D and 99.51% on OU-LP, which exhibit the ability of the Vision Transformer model to outperform the state-of-the-art methods.",

Firstly, to eliminate the redundant computations in shifted windows, a novel tiling strategy is employed, which helps the developed multiplier array to fully utilize the sparsity. Additionally, we deploy a dynamic pipeline interleaving dataflow, which not only reduces the processing latency but also maximizes data reuse, thereby decreasing access to memories. Furthermore, customized quantization strategies and approximate calculations for non-linear calculations are adopted to simplify the hardware complexity with negligible network accuracy loss. We implement SWAT on the Xilinx Alveo U50 platform and evaluate it with Swin-T on the ImageNet dataset.

Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown significant promise in medical image analysis, they have limitations in capturing the global context and lack interpretability, thereby hindering their clinical adoption. This study presents EFFResNet-ViT, a novel hybrid deep learning (DL) model designed to address these challenges by combining EfficientNet-B0 and ResNet-50 CNN backbones with a vision transformer (ViT) module. The proposed architecture employs a feature fusion strategy to integrate the local feature extraction strengths of CNNs with the global dependency modeling capabilities of transformers. The extracted features are further refined through a post-transformer CNN and a global average pooling layer to enhance the classification performance. To improve interpretability, EFFResNet-ViT incorporates Grad-CAM visualization techniques to highlight regions contributing to classification decisions and employs t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding for feature space analysis, providing insights into class separability. The proposed model was evaluated on two benchmark datasets: brain tumor (BT) CE-MRI for BT classification and a retinal image dataset for ophthalmological diagnosis. EFFResNet-ViT achieved state-of-the-art performance, with accuracies of 99.31% and 92.54% on the BT CE-MRI and retinal datasets, respectively. Comparative analyses demonstrate the superior classification performance and interpretability of EFFResNet-ViT over existing ViT and CNN-based hybrid models.

The previous methods generally address the core problem of visual grounding, i.e., multi-modal fusion and reasoning, with manually-designed mechanisms. Such heuristic designs are not only complicated but also make models easily overfit specific data distributions. To avoid this, we first propose TransVG, which establishes multi-modal correspondences by Transformers and localizes referred regions by directly regressing box coordinates. We empirically show that complicated fusion modules can be replaced by a simple stack of Transformer encoder layers with higher performance. However, the core fusion Transformer in TransVG is stand-alone against uni-modal encoders, and thus should be trained from scratch on limited visual grounding data, which makes it hard to be optimized and leads to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we further introduce TransVG++ to make two-fold improvements. For one thing, we upgrade our framework to a purely Transformer-based one by leveraging Vision Transformer (ViT) for vision feature encoding. For another, we devise Language Conditioned Vision Transformer that removes external fusion modules and reuses the uni-modal ViT for vision-language fusion at the intermediate layers.

Most current work uses a fixed single-scale window for modeling by default, ignoring the impact of window size on model performance. How-ever, this may limit the modeling potential of these window-based models for multi-scale information. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named Dynamic Window Vision Transformer (DW-ViT). The dynamic window strategy proposed by DW- ViT goes beyond the model that employs a fixed single window setting. To the best of our knowl-edge, we are the first to use dynamic multi-scale windows to explore the upper limit of the effect of window settings on model performance. In DW- ViT, multi-scale information is obtained by assigning windows of different sizes to different head groups of window multi-head self-attention. Then, the information is dynamically fused by assigning different weights to the multi-scale window branches. We con-ducted a detailed performance evaluation on three datasets, ImageNet-1K, ADE20K, and COCO. Compared with re-lated state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods, DW- ViT obtains the best performance. Specifically, compared with the current SoTA Swin Transformers [31], DW-ViT has achieved con-sistent and substantial improvements on all three datasets with similar parameters and computational costs. In addition, DW-ViT exhibits good scalability and can be easily inserted into any window-based visual transformers.11Code release: https://github.com/pzhren/DW-ViT.

Their large receptive field endows Transformer models with higher representation power than their CNN counterparts. Nevertheless, simply enlarging the receptive field also raises several concerns. On the one hand, using dense attention in ViT leads to excessive memory and computational cost, and features can be influenced by irrelevant parts that are beyond the region of interests. On the other hand, the handcrafted attention adopted in PVT or Swin Transformer is data agnostic and may limit the ability to model long-range relations. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel deformable multi-head attention module, where the positions of key and value pairs in self-attention are adaptively allocated in a data-dependent way. This flexible scheme enables the proposed deformable attention to dynamically focus on relevant regions while maintains the representation power of global attention.

Previous works achieved good performance on certain task by stacking various hand-designed modules and multi-scale features. However, these careful task-specific designs also make them lose their potential as general-purpose architectures. Therefore, we hope to build general architectures that can be applied to both tasks. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective network (SENet) based on vision Transformer (ViT), by employing a simple design of an asymmetric ViT-based encoder-decoder structure, we yield competitive results on both tasks, exhibiting greater versatility than meticulously crafted ones. To enhance the performance of universal architectures on both tasks, we propose some general methods targeting some common difficulties of the two tasks. First, we use image reconstruction as an auxiliary task during training to increase the difficulty of training, forcing the network to have a better perception of the image as a whole to help with segmentation tasks. In addition, we propose a local information capture module (LICM) to make up for the limitations of the patch-level attention mechanism in pixel-level COD and SOD tasks and a dynamic weighted loss (DW loss) to solve the problem that small target samples are more difficult to locate and segment in both tasks. Finally, we also conduct a preliminary exploration of joint training, trying to use one model to complete two tasks simultaneously. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/linuxsino/SENet.",

        "abstract": "PurposeVision transformers (ViT) detectors excel in processing natural images. However, when processing remote sensing images (RSIs), ViT methods generally exhibit inferior accuracy compared to approaches based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Recently, researchers have proposed various structural optimization strategies to enhance the performance of ViT detectors, but the progress has been insignificant. We contend that the frequent scarcity of RSI samples is the primary cause of this problem, and model modifications alone cannot solve it.Design/methodology/approachTo address this, we introduce a faster RCNN-based approach, termed QAGA-Net, which significantly enhances the performance of ViT detectors in RSI recognition. Initially, we propose a novel quantitative augmentation learning (QAL) strategy to address the sparse data distribution in RSIs. This strategy is integrated as the QAL module, a plug-and-play component active exclusively during the model\u2019s training phase. Subsequently, we enhanced the feature pyramid network (FPN) by introducing two efficient modules: a global attention (GA) module to model long-range feature dependencies and enhance multi-scale information fusion, and an efficient pooling (EP) module to optimize the model\u2019s capability to understand both high and low frequency information. Importantly, QAGA-Net has a compact model size and achieves a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy.FindingsWe verified the performance of QAGA-Net by using two different efficient ViT models as the detector\u2019s backbone. Extensive experiments on the NWPU-10 and DIOR20 datasets demonstrate that QAGA-Net achieves superior accuracy compared to 23 other ViT or CNN methods in the literature. Specifically, QAGA-Net shows an increase in mAP by 2.1% or 2.6% on the challenging DIOR20 dataset when compared to the top-ranked CNN or ViT detectors, respectively.Originality/valueThis paper highlights the impact of sparse data distribution on ViT detection performance. To address this, we introduce a fundamentally data-driven approach: the QAL module. Additionally, we introduced two efficient modules to enhance the performance of FPN. More importantly, our strategy has the potential to collaborate with other ViT detectors, as the proposed method does not require any structural modifications to the ViT backbone.",

        "abstract": "Objective. Emphysema is characterized by the destruction and permanent enlargement of the alveoli in the lung. According to visual CT appearance, emphysema can be divided into three subtypes: centrilobular emphysema (CLE), panlobular emphysema (PLE), and paraseptal emphysema (PSE). Automating emphysema classification can help precisely determine the patterns of lung destruction and provide a quantitative evaluation. Approach. We propose a vision transformer (ViT) model to classify the emphysema subtypes via CT images. First, large patches (61 \u00d7 61) are cropped from CT images which contain the area of normal lung parenchyma, CLE, PLE, and PSE. After resizing, the large patch is divided into small patches and these small patches are converted to a sequence of patch embeddings by flattening and linear embedding. A class embedding is concatenated to the patch embedding, and the positional embedding is added to the resulting embeddings described above. Then, the obtained embedding is fed into the transformer encoder blocks to generate the final representation. Finally, the learnable class embedding is fed to a softmax layer to classify the emphysema. Main results. To overcome the lack of massive data, the transformer encoder blocks (pre-trained on ImageNet) are transferred and fine-tuned in our ViT model. The average accuracy of the pre-trained ViT model achieves 95.95% in our lab\u2019s own dataset, which is higher than that of AlexNet, Inception-V3, MobileNet-V2, ResNet34, and ResNet50. Meanwhile, the pre-trained ViT model outperforms the ViT model without the pre-training. The accuracy of our pre-trained ViT model is higher than or comparable to that by available methods for the public dataset. Significance. The results demonstrated that the proposed ViT model can accurately classify the subtypes of emphysema using CT images. The ViT model can help make an effective computer-aided diagnosis of emphysema, and the ViT method can be extended to other medical applications.",

Recent advancements in computer vision, particularly the Swin transformer, have shown promising performance in image classification tasks, rivaling or surpassing traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The Swin transformer adopts a hierarchical and efficient approach using shifted windows, enabling the capture of both local and global contextual information in images. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Swin-GA-RF to enhance the classification performance of cervical cells in Pap smear images. Swin-GA-RF combines the strengths of the Swin transformer, genetic algorithm (GA) feature selection, and the replacement of the softmax layer with a random forest classifier. Our methodology involves extracting feature representations from the Swin transformer, utilizing GA to identify the optimal feature set, and employing random forest as the classification model. Additionally, data augmentation techniques are applied to augment the diversity and quantity of the SIPaKMeD1 cervical cancer image dataset. We compare the performance of the Swin-GA-RF Transformer with pre-trained CNN models using two classes and five classes of cervical cancer classification, employing both Adam and SGD optimizers. The experimental results demonstrate that Swin-GA-RF outperforms other Swin transformers and pre-trained CNN models. When utilizing the Adam optimizer, Swin-GA-RF achieves the highest performance in both binary and five-class classification tasks. Specifically, for binary classification, it achieves an accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 99.012, 99.015, 99.012, and 99.011, respectively. In the five-class classification, it achieves an accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 98.808, 98.812, 98.808, and 98.808, respectively. These results underscore the effectiveness of the Swin-GA-RF approach in cervical cancer classification, demonstrating its potential as a valuable tool for early diagnosis and screening programs.",

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in computer vision tasks in recent years. For 3D medical image tasks, deep convolutional neural networks based on an encoder\u2013decoder structure and skip-connection have been frequently used. However, CNNs have the drawback of being unable to learn global and remote semantic information well. On the other hand, the transformer has recently found success in natural language processing and computer vision as a result of its usage of a self-attention mechanism for global information modeling. For demanding prediction tasks, such as 3D medical picture segmentation, local and global characteristics are critical. We propose SwinBTS, a new 3D medical picture segmentation approach, which combines a transformer, convolutional neural network, and encoder\u2013decoder structure to define the 3D brain tumor semantic segmentation job as a sequence-to-sequence prediction challenge in this research. To extract contextual data, the 3D Swin Transformer is utilized as the network\u2019s encoder and decoder, and convolutional operations are employed for upsampling and downsampling. Finally, we achieve segmentation results using an improved Transformer module that we built for increasing detail feature extraction. Extensive experimental results on the BraTS 2019, BraTS 2020, and BraTS 2021 datasets reveal that SwinBTS outperforms state-of-the-art 3D algorithms for brain tumor segmentation on 3D MRI scanned images.",

However, existing self-attention methods either adopt sparse global attention or window attention to reduce the computation complexity, which may compromise the local feature learning or subject to some handcrafted designs. In contrast, local attention, which restricts the receptive field of each query to its own neighboring pixels, enjoys the benefits of both convolution and self-attention, namely local inductive bias and dynamic feature selection. Nevertheless, current local attention modules either use inefficient Im2Col function or rely on specific CUDA kernels that are hard to generalize to devices without CUDA support. In this paper, we propose a novel local attention module, Slide Attention, which leverages common convolution operations to achieve high efficiency, flexibility and generalizability. Specifically, we first re-interpret the column-based Im2Col function from a new row-based perspective and use Depthwise Convolution as an efficient substitution. On this basis, we propose a deformed shifting module based on the re-parameterization technique, which further relaxes the fixed key/value positions to deformed features in the local region. In this way, our module realizes the local attention paradigm in both efficient and flexible manner. Extensive experiments show that our slide attention module is applicable to a variety of advanced Vision Transformer models and compatible with various hardware devices, and achieves consistently improved performances on comprehensive benchmarks.",

Others generate forgery location labels by subtracting paired real and fake images, yet such paired data is difficult to collected and the generated label is usually discontinuous. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Unsupervised Inconsistency-Aware method based on Vision Transformer, called UIA-ViT, which only makes use of video-level labels and can learn inconsistency-aware feature without pixel-level annotations. Due to the self-attention mechanism, the attention map among patch embeddings naturally represents the consistency relation, making the vision Transformer suitable for the consistency representation learning. Based on vision Transformer, we propose two key components: Unsupervised Patch Consistency Learning (UPCL) and Progressive Consistency Weighted Assemble (PCWA). UPCL is designed for learning the consistency-related representation with progressive optimized pseudo annotations. PCWA enhances the final classification embedding with previous patch embeddings optimized by UPCL to further improve the detection performance.

Some methods estimate the pixel-wise depth maps from off-the-shelf depth estimators and then use them as an additional input to augment the RGB images. Depth-based methods attempt to convert estimated depth maps to pseudo-LiDAR and then use LiDAR-based object detectors or focus on the perspective of image and depth fusion learning. However, they demonstrate limited performance and efficiency as a result of depth inaccuracy and complex fusion mode with convolutions. Different from these approaches, our proposed depth-guided vision transformer with a normalizing flows (NF-DVT) network uses normalizing flows to build priors in depth maps to achieve more accurate depth information. Then we develop a novel Swin-Transformer-based backbone with a fusion module to process RGB image patches and depth map patches with two separate branches and fuse them using cross-attention to exchange information with each other. Furthermore, with the help of pixel-wise relative depth values in depth maps, we develop new relative position embeddings in the cross-attention mechanism to capture more accurate sequence ordering of input tokens. Our method is the first Swin-Transformer-based backbone architecture for monocular 3D object detection.

We evaluated the effectiveness of QR using three ViT architectures: vanilla ViT, Swin\u2010ViT and Next\u2010ViT, on four datasets: AID30, NWPU45, AFGR50 and UCM21. The results reveal that our Next\u2010ViT model surpasses 39 other advanced methods published in the past 3\u2009years, maintaining robust performance even with a limited number of training samples. We also discovered that our ViT and Swin\u2010ViT achieve significantly higher accuracy and robustness compared to other methods using the same backbone. Our findings confirm that ViTs can be as effective as CNNs for RSI classification, regardless of the dataset size. Our approach exclusively employs open\u2010source ViTs and easily accessible training strategies. Consequently, we believe that our method can significantly lower the barriers for geoscience researchers intending to use ViT for RSI applications.",

        "abstract": "Background Semantic segmentation of brain tumors plays a critical role in clinical treatment, especially for three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance imaging, which is often used in clinical practice. Automatic segmentation of the 3D structure of brain tumors can quickly help physicians understand the properties of tumors, such as the shape and size, thus improving the efficiency of preoperative planning and the odds of successful surgery. In past decades, 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have dominated automatic segmentation methods for 3D medical images, and these network structures have achieved good results. However, to reduce the number of neural network parameters, practitioners ensure that the size of convolutional kernels in 3D convolutional operations generally does not exceed $$7 \\times 7 \\times 7$$ 7 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7 , which also leads to CNNs showing limitations in learning long-distance dependent information. Vision Transformer (ViT) is very good at learning long-distance dependent information in images, but it suffers from the problems of many parameters. What\u2019s worse, the ViT cannot learn local dependency information in the previous layers under the condition of insufficient data. However, in the image segmentation task, being able to learn this local dependency information in the previous layers makes a big impact on the performance of the model. Methods This paper proposes the Swin Unet3D model, which represents voxel segmentation on medical images as a sequence-to-sequence prediction. The feature extraction sub-module in the model is designed as a parallel structure of Convolution and ViT so that all layers of the model are able to adequately learn both global and local dependency information in the image. Results On the validation dataset of Brats2021, our proposed model achieves dice coefficients of 0.840, 0.874, and 0.911 on the ET channel, TC channel, and WT channel, respectively. On the validation dataset of Brats2018, our model achieves dice coefficients of 0.716, 0.761, and 0.874 on the corresponding channels, respectively. Conclusion We propose a new segmentation model that combines the advantages of Vision Transformer and Convolution and achieves a better balance between the number of model parameters and segmentation accuracy.

B_ViT is an enhanced ViT architecture that supports the parallel processing of image patches and captures local and global spatial representations of malware images. B_ViT is a transfer learning-based model that uses a pre-trained ViT model on the ImageNet dataset to initialize the training parameters of transformers. Four B_ViT variants are experimented and evaluated on grayscale malware images collected from MalImg, Microsoft BIG datasets or converted from portable executable imports. The experiments show that B_ViT variants outperform the Input Enhanced vision transformer (IEViT) and ViT variants, achieving an accuracy equal to 99.49% and 99.99% for malware classification and detection respectively. The experiments also show that B_ViT is time effective for malware classification and detection where the average speed-up of B_ViT variants over IEViT and ViT variants are equal to 2.42 and 1.81 respectively. The analysis proves the efficiency of texture-based malware detection as well as the resilience of B_ViT to polymorphic obfuscation.

To this end, we propose a dual-branch transformer to com-bine image patches (i.e., tokens in a transformer) of different sizes to produce stronger image features. Our approach processes small-patch and large-patch tokens with two separate branches of different computational complexity and these tokens are then fused purely by attention multiple times to complement each other. Furthermore, to reduce computation, we develop a simple yet effective token fusion module based on cross attention, which uses a single token for each branch as a query to exchange information with other branches. Our proposed cross-attention only requires linear time for both computational and memory complexity instead of quadratic time otherwise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach performs better than or on par with several concurrent works on vision transformer, in addition to efficient CNN models.

Even without customized image operators such as convolutions, ViTs can yield competitive performance when properly trained on massive data. However, the computational overhead of ViTs remains prohibitive, due to stacking multi-head self-attention modules and else. Compared to the vast literature and prevailing success in compressing convolutional neural networks, the study of Vision Transformer compression has also just emerged, and existing works focused on one or two aspects of compression. This paper proposes a unified ViT compression framework that seamlessly assembles three effective techniques: pruning, layer skipping, and knowledge distillation. We formulate a budget-constrained, end-to-end optimization framework, targeting jointly learning model weights, layer-wise pruning ratios/masks, and skip configurations, under a distillation loss. The optimization problem is then solved using the primal-dual algorithm. Experiments are conducted with several ViT variants, e.g. DeiT and T2T-ViT backbones on the ImageNet dataset, and our approach consistently outperforms recent competitors. For example, DeiT-Tiny can be trimmed down to 50\\% of the original FLOPs almost without losing accuracy. Codes are available online:~\\url{https://github.com/VITA-Group/UVC}.",

Therefore, inspired by the successful application of Transformer architecture in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, a novel Transformer method called LeViT was introduced for automatic asphalt pavement image classification. LeViT consists of convolutional layers, transformer stages where Multi-layer Perception (MLP) and multi-head self-attention blocks alternate using the residual connection, and two classifier heads. To conduct the proposed methods, three different sources of pavement image datasets and pre-trained weights based on ImageNet were attained. The performance of the proposed model was compared with six state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning models. All of them were trained based on transfer learning strategy. Compared to the tested SOTA methods, LeViT has less than 1/8 of the parameters of the original Vision Transformer (ViT) and 1/2 of ResNet and InceptionNet. Experimental results show that after training for 100 epochs with a 16 batch-size, the proposed method acquired 91.56% accuracy, 91.72% precision, 91.56% recall, and 91.45% F1-score in the Chinese asphalt pavement dataset and 99.17% accuracy, 99.19% precision, 99.17% recall, and 99.17% F1-score in the German asphalt pavement dataset, which is the best performance among all the tested SOTA models. Moreover, it shows superiority in inference speed (86 ms/step), which is approximately 25% of the original ViT method and 80% of some prevailing CNN-based models, including DenseNet, VGG, and ResNet. Overall, the proposed method can achieve competitive performance with fewer computation costs. In addition, a visualization method combining Grad-CAM and Attention Rollout was proposed to analyze the classification results and explore what has been learned in every MLP and attention block of LeViT, which improved the interpretability of the proposed pavement image classification model.",

More specifically, the model uses an attention mechanism to process data, which overcomes the flaw of the short\u2010term memory in recurrent neural network (RNN) and the difficulty of learning remote dependency in convolutional neural network. It supports parallelization and has a faster computing speed than RNN. A sliding window mechanism is presented to improve the capability of modeling local features for ViT. The hierarchical focal loss function is used to improve the classification effect, and solve the issue of the data imbalance. The public intrusion detection dataset NSL\u2010KDD is used for experimental simulations. By experimental simulations, the accuracy is up to 99.68%, the false\u2010positive rate is 0.22%, and the recall rate is 99.57%, which show that the improved ViT has better accuracy, false positive rate, and recall rate than existing intrusion detection models.",

        "abstract": "The latest vision transformer (ViT) has stronger contextual feature representation capability than the existing convolutional neural networks and thus has the potential to depict the remote sensing scenes, which usually have more complicated object distribution and spatial arrangement than ground image scenes. However, recent researches reflect that while ViT learns global features, it also ignores the key local features, which poses a bottleneck for understanding remote sensing scenes. In this letter, we tackle this challenge by proposing a novel multiinstance vision transformer (MITformer). Its originality mainly lies in the classic multiple instance learning (MIL) formulation, where each image patch embedded in ViT is regarded as an instance and each image is regarded as a bag. The benefit of designing ViT under MIL formulation is straightforward, as it helps highlight the feature response of key local regions of remote sensing scenes. Moreover, to enhance the feature propagation of local features, attention-based multilayer perceptron (AMLP) head is embedded at the end of each encoder unit. Finally, to minimize the potential semantic prediction differences between the classic ViT and our MIL head, a semantic consistency loss is designed. Experiments on three remote sensing scene classification benchmarks show that our proposed MITformer outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods and validate the effectiveness of each component in our MITformer.",

        "abstract": "Since Google proposed Transformer in 2017, it has made significant natural language processing (NLP) development. However, the increasing cost is a large amount of calculation and parameters. Previous researchers designed and proposed some accelerator structures for transformer models in field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to deal with NLP tasks efficiently. Now, the development of Transformer has also affected computer vision (CV) and has rapidly surpassed convolution neural networks (CNNs) in various image tasks. And there are apparent differences between the image data used in CV and the sequence data in NLP. The details in the models contained with transformer units in these two fields are also different. The difference in terms of data brings about the problem of the locality. The difference in the model structure brings about the problem of path dependence, which is not noticed in the existing related accelerator design. Therefore, in this work, we propose the ViA, a novel vision transformer (ViT) accelerator architecture based on FPGA, to execute the transformer application efficiently and avoid the cost of these challenges. By analyzing the data structure in the ViT, we design an appropriate partition strategy to reduce the impact of data locality in the image and improve the efficiency of computation and memory access. Meanwhile, by observing the computing flow of the ViT, we use the half-layer mapping and throughput analysis to reduce the impact of path dependence caused by the shortcut mechanism and fully utilize hardware resources to execute the Transformer efficiently. Based on optimization strategies, we design two reuse processing engines with the internal stream, different from the previous overlap or stream design patterns. In the stage of the experiment, we implement the ViA architecture in Xilinx Alveo U50 FPGA and finally achieved ~5.2 times improvement of energy efficiency compared with NVIDIA Tesla V100, and 4\u201310 times improvement of performance compared with related accelerators based on FPGA, that obtained nearly 309.6 GOP/s computing performance in the peek.",

This often leads to inconsistent data distributions between training and testing subsets, resulting in degraded model performance. In this study, we introduce an optimized data distribution learning (ODDL) strategy and develop an object detection framework based on the Faster R\u2010CNN architecture, named ODDL\u2010Net. The ODDL strategy begins with an optimized augmentation (OA) technique, overcoming the limitations of conventional data augmentation methods. Next, we propose an optimized mosaic algorithm (OMA), improving upon the shortcomings of traditional Mosaic augmentation techniques. Additionally, we introduce a feature fusion regularization (FFR) method, addressing the inherent limitations of classic feature pyramid networks. These innovations are integrated into three modular, plug\u2010and\u2010play components\u2014namely, the OA, OMA, and FFR modules\u2014ensuring that the ODDL strategy can be seamlessly incorporated into existing detection frameworks without requiring significant modifications. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed ODDL\u2010Net, we develop two variants based on different ViT architectures: the Next ViT (NViT) small model and the Swin Transformer (SwinT) tiny model, both used as detection backbones. Experimental results on the NWPU10, DIOR20, MAR20, and GLH\u2010Bridge datasets demonstrate that both variants of ODDL\u2010Net achieve impressive accuracy, surpassing 23 state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art methods introduced since 2023. Specifically, ODDL\u2010Net\u2010NViT attained accuracies of 78.3% on the challenging DIOR20 dataset and 61.4% on the GLH\u2010Bridge dataset. Notably, this represents a substantial improvement of approximately 23% over the Faster R\u2010CNN\u2010ResNet50 baseline on the DIOR20 dataset. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that ViTs are well suited for high\u2010accuracy object detection in RSIs. Furthermore, it provides a straightforward solution for building ViT\u2010based detectors, offering a practical approach that requires little model modification.",

This poses a distinct challenge: Can a visual neural network be designed to infer as fast as CNNs and perform as powerful as ViTs? Recent works have tried to design CNN-Transformer hybrid architectures to address this issue, yet the overall performance of these works is far away from satisfactory. To end these, we propose a next generation vision Transformer for efficient deployment in realistic industrial scenarios, namely Next-ViT, which dominates both CNNs and ViTs from the perspective of latency/accuracy trade-off. In this work, the Next Convolution Block (NCB) and Next Transformer Block (NTB) are respectively developed to capture local and global information with deployment-friendly mechanisms. Then, Next Hybrid Strategy (NHS) is designed to stack NCB and NTB in an efficient hybrid paradigm, which boosts performance in various downstream tasks. Extensive experiments show that Next-ViT significantly outperforms existing CNNs, ViTs and CNN-Transformer hybrid architectures with respect to the latency/accuracy trade-off across various vision tasks. On TensorRT, Next-ViT surpasses ResNet by 5.5 mAP (from 40.4 to 45.9) on COCO detection and 7.7% mIoU (from 38.8% to 46.5%) on ADE20K segmentation under similar latency. Meanwhile, it achieves comparable performance with CSWin, while the inference speed is accelerated by 3.6x.

The adaptation is challenging because of heavy computation and memory storage. Each model needs an independent and complete finetuning process to adapt to different tasks, which limits its transferability to different visual domains. To address this challenge, we propose an effective adaptation approach for Transformer, namely AdaptFormer, which can adapt the pre-trained ViTs into many different image and video tasks efficiently. It possesses several benefits more appealing than prior arts. Firstly, AdaptFormer introduces lightweight modules that only add less than 2% extra parameters to a ViT, while it is able to increase the ViT's transferability without updating its original pre-trained parameters, significantly outperforming the existing 100\\% fully fine-tuned models on action recognition benchmarks. Secondly, it can be plug-and-play in different Transformers and scalable to many visual tasks. Thirdly, extensive experiments on five image and video datasets show that AdaptFormer largely improves ViTs in the target domains. For example, when updating just 1.5% extra parameters, it achieves about 10% and 19% relative improvement compared to the fully fine-tuned models on Something-Something~v2 and HMDB51, respectively.

        "abstract": "Remote sensing image classification (RSIC) is a classical and fundamental task in the intelligent interpretation of remote sensing imagery, which can provide unique labeling information for each acquired remote sensing image. Thanks to the potent global context information extraction ability of the multi-head self-attention (MSA) mechanism, visual transformer (ViT)-based architectures have shown excellent capability in natural scene image classification. However, in order to achieve powerful RSIC performance, it is insufficient to capture global spatial information alone. Specifically, for fine-grained target recognition tasks with high inter-class similarity, discriminative and effective local feature representations are key to correct classification. In addition, due to the lack of inductive biases, the powerful global spatial context representation capability of ViT requires lengthy training procedures and large-scale pre-training data volume. To solve the above problems, a hybrid architecture of convolution neural network (CNN) and ViT is proposed to improve the RSIC ability, called P2FEViT, which integrates plug-and-play CNN features with ViT. In this paper, the feature representation capabilities of CNN and ViT applying for RSIC are first analyzed. Second, aiming to integrate the advantages of CNN and ViT, a novel approach embedding CNN features into the ViT architecture is proposed, which can make the model synchronously capture and fuse global context and local multimodal information to further improve the classification capability of ViT. Third, based on the hybrid structure, only a simple cross-entropy loss is employed for model training. The model can also have rapid and comfortable convergence with relatively less training data than the original ViT. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on the public and challenging remote sensing scene classification dataset of NWPU-RESISC45 (NWPU-R45) and the self-built fine-grained target classification dataset called BIT-AFGR50. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed P2FEViT can effectively improve the feature description capability and obtain outstanding image classification performance, while significantly reducing the high dependence of ViT on large-scale pre-training data volume and accelerating the convergence speed. The code and self-built dataset will be released at our webpages.",

They only consider the attention in a single feature layer, but ignore the complementarity of attention in different layers. In this article, we propose broad attention to improve the performance by incorporating the attention relationship of different layers for vision transformer (ViT), which is called BViT. The broad attention is implemented by broad connection and parameter-free attention. Broad connection of each transformer layer promotes the transmission and integration of information for BViT. Without introducing additional trainable parameters, parameter-free attention jointly focuses on the already available attention information in different layers for extracting useful information and building their relationship. Experiments on image classification tasks demonstrate that BViT delivers superior accuracy of 75.0%/81.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 5M/22M parameters. Moreover, we transfer BViT to downstream object recognition benchmarks to achieve 98.9% and 89.9% on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, respectively, that exceed ViT with fewer parameters. For the generalization test, the broad attention in Swin Transformer, T2T-ViT and LVT also brings an improvement of more than 1%.

The above models are trained under red grape datasets collected under natural light. In addition, the dataset is expanded through image data augmentation to achieve a better training effect. After 200 epochs of training, SwinGD obtained an exciting mAP value of 94% when IoU = 0.5. In case of overexposure, overdarkness, and occlusion, SwinGD can recognize more accurately and robustly compared with other models. At the same time, SwinGD still has a better effect when dealing with dense grape bunches. Furthermore, 100 pictures of grapes containing 655 grape bunches are downloaded from Baidu pictures to detect the effect. The Swin Transformer has an accuracy of 91.5%. In order to verify the universality of SwinGD, we conducted a test under green grape images. The experimental results show that SwinGD has a good effect in practical application. The success of SwinGD provides a new solution for precision harvesting in agriculture.",

        "abstract": "Building extraction is a popular topic in remote sensing image processing. Efficient building extraction algorithms can identify and segment building areas to provide informative data for downstream tasks. Currently, building extraction is mainly achieved by deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on the U-shaped encoder\u2013decoder architecture. However, the local perceptive field of the convolutional operation poses a challenge for CNNs to fully capture the semantic information of large buildings, especially in high-resolution remote sensing images. Considering the recent success of the Transformer in computer vision tasks, in this paper, first we propose a shifted-window (swin) Transformer-based encoding booster. The proposed encoding booster includes a swin Transformer pyramid containing patch merging layers for down-sampling, which enables our encoding booster to extract semantics from multi-level features at different scales. Most importantly, the receptive field is significantly expanded by the global self-attention mechanism of the swin Transformer, allowing the encoding booster to capture the large-scale semantic information effectively and transcend the limitations of CNNs. Furthermore, we integrate the encoding booster in a specially designed U-shaped network through a novel manner, named the Swin Transformer-based Encoding Booster- U-shaped Network (STEB-UNet), to achieve the feature-level fusion of local and large-scale semantics. Remarkably, compared with other Transformer-included networks, the computational complexity and memory requirement of the STEB-UNet are significantly reduced due to the swin design, making the network training much easier. Experimental results show that the STEB-UNet can effectively discriminate and extract buildings of different scales and demonstrate higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art networks on public datasets.",

        "abstract": "Since introduced, Swin Transformer has achieved remarkable results in the field of computer vision, it has sparked the need for dedicated hardware accelerators, specifically catering to edge computing demands. For the advantages of flexibility, low power consumption, FPGAs have been widely employed to accelerate the inference of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and show potential in Transformer-based models. Unlike CNNs, which mainly involve multiply and accumulate (MAC) operations, Transformer involve non-linear computations such as Layer Normalization (LN), Softmax, and GELU. These nonlinear computations do pose challenges for accelerator design. In this paper, to propose an efficient FPGA-based hardware accelerator for Swin Transformer, we focused on using different strategies to deal with these nonlinear calculations and efficiently handling MAC computations to achieve the best acceleration results. We replaced LN with BN, Given that Batch Normalization (BN) can be fused with linear layers during inference to optimize inference efficiency. The modified Swin-T, Swin-S, and Swin-B respectively achieved Top-1 accuracy rates of 80.7%, 82.7%, and 82.8% in ImageNet. Furthermore, We employed strategies for approximate computation to design hardware-friendly architectures for Softmax and GELU computations. We also designed an efficient Matrix Multiplication Unit to handle all linear computations in Swin Transformer. As a conclude, compared with CPU (AMD Ryzen 5700X), our accelerator achieved 1.76x, 1.66x, and 1.25x speedup and achieved 20.45x, 18.60x, and 14.63x energy efficiency (FPS/power consumption) improvement on Swin-T, Swin-S, and Swin-B models, respectively. Compared to GPU (Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti), we achieved 5.05x, 4.42x, and 3.00x energy efficiency improvement respectively.

While the vulnerability of CNNs to adversarial attacks is a well-known problem, recent works have shown that ViTs are also susceptible to such attacks and suffer significant performance degradation under attack. The vulnerability of ViTs to carefully engineered adversarial samples raises serious concerns about their safety in clinical settings. In this paper, we propose a novel self-ensembling method to enhance the robustness of ViT in the presence of adversarial attacks. The proposed Self-Ensembling Vision Transformer (SEViT) leverages the fact that feature representations learned by initial blocks of a ViT are relatively unaffected by adversarial perturbations. Learning multiple classifiers based on these intermediate feature representations and combining these predictions with that of the final ViT classifier can provide robustness against adversarial attacks. Measuring the consistency between the various predictions can also help detect adversarial samples. Experiments on two modalities (chest X-ray and fundoscopy) demonstrate the efficacy of SEViT architecture to defend against various adversarial attacks in the gray-box (attacker has full knowledge of the target model, but not the defense mechanism) setting.

Nevertheless, ViT emphasizes the low-resolution features because of the consecutive downsamplings, result in a lack of detailed localization information, making it unsuitable for image registration.

Although vision transformer (ViT)-based methods have been explored to boost the long-range dependencies of high-resolution remote sensing images, the connectivity between neighboring windows is still limited. Meanwhile, ViT-based methods commonly contain a large number of parameters, resulting in a huge computational consumption. In this paper, a novel lightweight dual-branch swin transformer (LDBST) method for remote sensing scene classification is proposed, and the discriminative ability of scene features is increased through combining a ViT branch and convolutional neural network (CNN) branch. First, based on the hierarchical swin transformer model, LDBST divides the input features of each stage into two parts, which are then separately fed into the two branches. For the ViT branch, a dual multilayer perceptron structure with a depthwise convolutional layer, termed Conv-MLP, is integrated into the branch to boost the connections with neighboring windows. Then, a simple-structured CNN branch with maximum pooling preserves the strong features of the scene feature map. Specifically, the CNN branch lightens the LDBST, by avoiding complex multi-head attention and multilayer perceptron computations. To obtain better feature representation, LDBST was pretrained on the large-scale remote scene classification images of the MLRSN and RSD46-WHU datasets. These two pretrained weights were fine-tuned on target scene classification datasets. The experimental results showed that the proposed LDBST method was more effective than some other advanced remote sensing scene classification methods.",

Segmentation of head and neck (H&N) tumors is a prerequisite for radiotherapy planning but a time-consuming process. In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) have become the de facto standard for automated image segmentation. However, due to the expensive computational cost associated with enlarging the field of view in DCNNs, their ability to model long-range dependency is still limited, and this can result in sub-optimal segmentation performance for objects with background context spanning over long distances. On the other hand, Transformer models have demonstrated excellent capabilities in capturing such long-range information in several semantic segmentation tasks performed on medical images.\n\n\nPURPOSE\nDespite the impressive representation capacity of vision transformer models, current vision transformer-based segmentation models still suffer from inconsistent and incorrect dense predictions when fed with multi-modal input data. We suspect that the power of their self-attention mechanism may be limited in extracting the complementary information that exists in multi-modal data. To this end, we propose a novel segmentation model, debuted, Cross-modal Swin Transformer (SwinCross), with cross-modal attention (CMA) module to incorporate cross-modal feature extraction at multiple resolutions.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe propose a novel architecture for cross-modal 3D semantic segmentation with two main components: (1) a cross-modal 3D Swin Transformer for integrating information from multiple modalities (PET and CT), and (2) a cross-modal shifted window attention block for learning complementary information from the modalities. To evaluate the efficacy of our approach, we conducted experiments and ablation studies on the HECKTOR 2021 challenge dataset. We compared our method against nnU-Net (the backbone of the top-5 methods in HECKTOR 2021) and other state-of-the-art transformer-based models, including UNETR and Swin UNETR. The experiments employed a five-fold cross-validation setup using PET and CT images.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEmpirical evidence demonstrates that our proposed method consistently outperforms the comparative techniques. This success can be attributed to the CMA module's capacity to enhance inter-modality feature representations between PET and CT during head-and-neck tumor segmentation. Notably, SwinCross consistently surpasses Swin UNETR across all five folds, showcasing its proficiency in learning multi-modal feature representations at varying resolutions through the cross-modal attention modules.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe introduced a cross-modal Swin Transformer for automating the delineation of head and neck tumors in PET and CT images. Our model incorporates a cross-modality attention module, enabling the exchange of features between modalities at multiple resolutions. The experimental results establish the superiority of our method in capturing improved inter-modality correlations between PET and CT for head-and-neck tumor segmentation. Furthermore, the proposed methodology holds applicability to other semantic segmentation tasks involving different imaging modalities like SPECT/CT or PET/MRI.

        "abstract": "Vision transformer (ViT) provides new ideas for polarization synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image classification due to its advantages in learning global-spatial information. However, the lack of local-spatial information within samples and correlation information among samples, as well as the complexity of network structure, limit the application of ViT in practice. In addition, dual-frequency PolSAR data provide rich information, but there are fewer related studies compared to single-frequency classification algorithms. In this article, we adopt ViT as the basic framework, and propose a novel model based on mixed patch interaction for dual-frequency PolSAR image adaptive fusion classification (PolSAR-MPIformer). First, a mixed patch interaction (MPI) module is designed for the feature extraction, which replaces the high-complexity self-attention in ViT with patch interaction intra- and intersample. Besides the global-spatial information learning within samples by ViT, the MPI module adds the learning of local-spatial information within samples and correlation information among samples, thereby obtaining more discriminative features through a low-complexity network. Subsequently, a dual-frequency adaptive fusion (DAF) module is constructed as the classifier of PolSAR-MPIformer. On the one hand, the attention mechanism is utilized in DAF to reduce the impact of speckle noise while preserving details. On the other hand, the DAF evaluates the classification confidence of each band and assigns different weights accordingly, which achieves reasonable utilization of the complementarity between dual-frequency data and improves classification accuracy. Experiments on four real dual-frequency PolSAR datasets substantiate the superiority of the proposed PolSAR-MPIformer over other state-of-the-art algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Recently, masked image modeling (MIM) has offered a new methodology of self-supervised pre-training of vision transformers. A key idea of efficient implementation is to discard the masked image patches (or tokens) throughout the target network (encoder), which requires the encoder to be a plain vision transformer (e.g., ViT), albeit hierarchical vision transformers (e.g., Swin Transformer) have potentially better properties in formulating vision inputs. In this paper, we offer a new design of hierarchical vision transformers named HiViT (short for Hierarchical ViT) that enjoys both high efficiency and good performance in MIM. The key is to remove the unnecessary\"local inter-unit operations\", deriving structurally simple hierarchical vision transformers in which mask-units can be serialized like plain vision transformers. For this purpose, we start with Swin Transformer and (i) set the masking unit size to be the token size in the main stage of Swin Transformer, (ii) switch off inter-unit self-attentions before the main stage, and (iii) eliminate all operations after the main stage. Empirical studies demonstrate the advantageous performance of HiViT in terms of fully-supervised, self-supervised, and transfer learning. In particular, in running MAE on ImageNet-1K, HiViT-B reports a +0.6% accuracy gain over ViT-B and a 1.9$\\times$ speed-up over Swin-B, and the performance gain generalizes to downstream tasks of detection and segmentation.

Our framework, vision transformer (ViT)-MVT, built on a plain and nonhierarchical ViT, incorporates numerous visual tasks into a modest supernet and optimizes them jointly across various dataset domains. For the design of ViT-MVT, we augment the ViT with a multihead self-attention (MHSE) to offer complementary cues in the channel and spatial dimension, as well as a local perception unit (LPU) and locality feed-forward network (locality FFN) for information exchange in the local region, thus endowing ViT-MVT with the ability to effectively optimize multiple tasks. Besides, we construct a search space comprising potential architectures with a broad spectrum of model sizes to offer various optimum candidates for diverse tasks. After that, we design a layer-adaptive sharing technique that automatically determines whether each layer of the transformer block is shared or not for all tasks, enabling ViT-MVT to obtain task-shared parameters for a reduction of storage and task-specific parameters to learn task-related features such that boosting performance. Finally, we introduce a joint-task evolutionary search algorithm to discover an optimal backbone for all tasks under total model size constraint, which challenges the conventional wisdom that visual tasks are typically supplied with backbone networks developed for image classification. Extensive experiments reveal that ViT-MVT delivers exceptional performances for multiple visual tasks over state-of-the-art methods while necessitating considerably fewer total storage costs. We further demonstrate that once ViT-MVT has been trained, ViT-MVT is capable of incremental learning when generalized to new tasks while retaining identical performances for trained tasks.

        "abstract": "The pretrain-then-finetune paradigm has been widely adopted in computer vision. But as the size of Vision Transformer (ViT) grows exponentially, the full finetuning becomes prohibitive in view of the heavier storage overhead. Motivated by parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) on language transformers, recent studies attempt to insert lightweight adaptation modules (e.g., adapter layers or prompt tokens) to pretrained ViT and only finetune these modules while the pretrained weights are frozen. However, these modules were originally proposed to finetune language models and did not take into account the prior knowledge specifically for visual tasks. In this paper, we propose to construct Convolutional Bypasses (Convpass) in ViT as adaptation modules, introducing only a small amount (less than 0.5% of model parameters) of trainable parameters to adapt the large ViT. Different from other PETL methods, Convpass benefits from the hard-coded inductive bias of convolutional layers and thus is more suitable for visual tasks, especially in the low-data regime. Experimental results on VTAB-1K benchmark and few-shot learning datasets show that Convpass outperforms current language-oriented adaptation modules, demonstrating the necessity to tailor vision-oriented adaptation modules for adapting vision models.",

Unleashing their excellent performance on memory and compute constraint devices is therefore an important research topic. However, how to distill knowledge from one self-supervised ViT to another has not yet been explored. Moreover, the existing self-supervised knowledge distillation (SSKD) methods focus on ConvNet based architectures are suboptimal for ViT knowledge distillation. In this paper, we study knowledge distillation of self-supervised vision transformers (ViT-SSKD). We show that directly distilling information from the crucial attention mechanism from teacher to student can significantly narrow the performance gap between both. In experiments on ImageNet-Subset and ImageNet-1K, we show that our method AttnDistill outperforms existing self-supervised knowledge distillation (SSKD) methods and achieves state-of-the-art k-NN accuracy compared with self-supervised learning (SSL) methods learning from scratch (with the ViT-S model). We are also the first to apply the tiny ViT-T model on self-supervised learning. Moreover, AttnDistill is independent of self-supervised learning algorithms, it can be adapted to ViT based SSL methods to improve the performance in future research.

The shifted patch tokenization (SPT) compensates for the data deficiency by increasing the data samples based on spatial information of the image patches while the swin transformer provides linear computational complexity by calculating self-attention between the shifted window based patches. For model validation, the SPT-Swin framework is trained on popular benchmark image datasets such as ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and the classification accuracies are found 89.45%, 95.67% and 92.95% respectively.

In this paper, we show that, unlike convolution neural networks (CNNs)that can be improved by stacking more convolutional layers, the performance of ViTs saturate fast when scaled to be deeper. More specifically, we empirically observe that such scaling difficulty is caused by the attention collapse issue: as the transformer goes deeper, the attention maps gradually become similar and even much the same after certain layers. In other words, the feature maps tend to be identical in the top layers of deep ViT models. This fact demonstrates that in deeper layers of ViTs, the self-attention mechanism fails to learn effective concepts for representation learning and hinders the model from getting expected performance gain. Based on above observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, named Re-attention, to re-generate the attention maps to increase their diversity at different layers with negligible computation and memory cost. The pro-posed method makes it feasible to train deeper ViT models with consistent performance improvements via minor modification to existing ViT models. Notably, when training a deep ViT model with 32 transformer blocks, the Top-1 classification accuracy can be improved by 1.6% on ImageNet.

We hypothesize that spectral layers cap-ture high-frequency information such as lines and edges, while attention layers capture token interactions. We inves-tigate this hypothesis through this work and observe that indeed mixing spectral and multi-headed attention layers provides a better transformer architecture. We thus pro-pose the novel Spectformer architecture for vision trans-formers that has initial spectral and deeper multi-headed attention layers. We believe that the resulting representation allows the transformer to capture the feature repre-sentation appropriately and it yields improved performance over other transformer representations. For instance, it im-proves the top-1 accuracy by 2% on ImageNet compared to both GFNet-H and LiT. SpectFormer-H-S reaches 84.25% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1 K (state of the art for small version). Further, Spectformer-H-L achieves 85.7% which is the state of the art for the comparable base version of the transformers. We further validated the SpectFormer per-formance in other scenarios such as transfer learning on standard datasets such as ClFAR-10, ClFAR-100, Oxford-lIlT-flower, and Standford Car datasets. We then investigate its use in downstream tasks such as object detection and instance segmentation on the MS-COCO dataset and ob-serve that Spectformer shows consistent performance that is comparable to the best backbones and can be further optimized and improved.

To effectively and efficiently model the crucial temporal information within a video clip, we propose a Temporally Efficient Vision Transformer (TeViT) for video instance segmentation (VIS). Different from previous transformer-based VIS methods, TeViT is nearly convolution-free, which contains a transformer backbone and a query-based video instance segmentation head. In the backbone stage, we propose a nearly parameter-free messenger shift mechanism for early temporal context fusion. In the head stages, we propose a parameter-shared spatiotemporal query interaction mechanism to build the one-to-one correspondence between video instances and queries. Thus, TeViT fully utilizes both frame-level and instance-level temporal context information and obtains strong temporal modeling capacity with negligible extra computational cost. On three widely adopted VIS benchmarks, i.e., YouTube-VIS-2019, YouTube-VIS-2021, and OVIS, TeViT obtains state-of-the-art results and maintains high inference speed, e.g., 46.6 AP with 68.9 FPS on YouTube-VIS-2019.

        "abstract": "Despite the tantalizing success in a broad of vision tasks, transformers have not yet demonstrated on-par ability as ConvNets in high-resolution image generative modeling. In this paper, we seek to explore using pure transformers to build a generative adversarial network for high-resolution image synthesis. To this end, we believe that local attention is crucial to strike the balance between computational efficiency and modeling capacity. Hence, the proposed generator adopts Swin transformer in a style-based architecture. To achieve a larger receptive field, we propose double attention which simultaneously leverages the context of the local and the shifted windows, leading to improved generation quality. Moreover, we show that offering the knowledge of the absolute position that has been lost in window-based transformers greatly benefits the generation quality. The proposed StyleSwin is scalable to high resolutions, with both the coarse geometry and fine structures benefit from the strong expressivity of transformers. However, blocking artifacts occur during high-resolution synthesis because performing the local attention in a block-wise manner may break the spatial coherency. To solve this, we empirically investigate various solutions, among which we find that employing a wavelet discriminator to examine the spectral discrepancy effectively suppresses the artifacts. Extensive experiments show the superiority over prior transformer-based GANs, especially on high resolutions, e.g., $1024 \\times$ 1024. The StyleSwin, without complex training strategies, excels over StyleGAN on CelebA-HQ 1024, and achieves on-par performance on FFHQ-1024, proving the promise of using transformers for high-resolution image generation.

In terms of hardware, we develop a dedicated chunk-based accelerator featuring multiple tailored subprocessors to individually handle ViTs\u2019 different types of operations, alleviating reconfigurable overhead. In addition, we design a tailored row-stationary dataflow to seize the pipeline processing opportunity introduced by our PoT scaling factors, thereby enhancing throughput.

However, is the attention mechanism truly an indispensable part of ViT? Can it be replaced by some other alternatives? To demystify the role of attention mechanism, we simplify it into an extremely simple case: ZERO FLOP and ZERO parameter. Concretely, we revisit the shift operation. It does not contain any parameter or arithmetic calculation. The only operation is to exchange a small portion of the channels between neighboring features. Based on this simple operation, we construct a new backbone network, namely ShiftViT, where the attention layers in ViT are substituted by shift operations. Surprisingly, ShiftViT works quite well in several mainstream tasks, e.g., classification, detection, and segmentation. The performance is on par with or even better than the strong baseline Swin Transformer. These results suggest that the attention mechanism might not be the vital factor that makes ViT successful. It can be even replaced by a zero-parameter operation. We should pay more attentions to the remaining parts of ViT in the future work. Code is available at github.com/microsoft/SPACH.",

        "abstract": "Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) has recently led the trends of visual self-supervision area by an elegant asymmetric encoder-decoder design, which significantly optimizes both the pre-training efficiency and fine-tuning accuracy. Notably, the success of the asymmetric structure relies on the\"global\"property of Vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT), whose self-attention mechanism reasons over arbitrary subset of discrete image patches. However, it is still unclear how the advanced Pyramid-based ViTs (e.g., PVT, Swin) can be adopted in MAE pre-training as they commonly introduce operators within\"local\"windows, making it difficult to handle the random sequence of partial vision tokens. In this paper, we propose Uniform Masking (UM), successfully enabling MAE pre-training for Pyramid-based ViTs with locality (termed\"UM-MAE\"for short). Specifically, UM includes a Uniform Sampling (US) that strictly samples $1$ random patch from each $2 \\times 2$ grid, and a Secondary Masking (SM) which randomly masks a portion of (usually $25\\%$) the already sampled regions as learnable tokens. US preserves equivalent elements across multiple non-overlapped local windows, resulting in the smooth support for popular Pyramid-based ViTs; whilst SM is designed for better transferable visual representations since US reduces the difficulty of pixel recovery pre-task that hinders the semantic learning. We demonstrate that UM-MAE significantly improves the pre-training efficiency (e.g., it speeds up and reduces the GPU memory by $\\sim 2\\times$) of Pyramid-based ViTs, but maintains the competitive fine-tuning performance across downstream tasks. For example using HTC++ detector, the pre-trained Swin-Large backbone self-supervised under UM-MAE only in ImageNet-1K can even outperform the one supervised in ImageNet-22K.

However, there are still no works to explore the fundamental natures (e.g., modality-aware inputs, suitable multimodal pre-training, and efficient finetuning) in vanilla ViT for multimodal FAS. In this paper, we investigate three key factors (i.e., inputs, pre-training, and finetuning) in ViT for multimodal FAS with RGB, Infrared (IR), and Depth. First, in terms of the ViT inputs, we find that leveraging local feature descriptors (such as histograms of oriented gradients) benefits the ViT on IR modality but not RGB or Depth modalities. Second, in consideration of the task (FAS vs. generic object classification) and modality (multimodal vs. unimodal) gaps, ImageNet pre-trained models might be sub-optimal for the multimodal FAS task. Finally, in observation of the inefficiency on direct finetuning the whole or partial ViT, we design an adaptive multimodal adapter (AMA), which can efficiently aggregate local multimodal features while freezing majority of ViT parameters. To bridge these gaps, we propose the modality-asymmetric masked autoencoder (M$$^{2}$$\n \n \n 2\n \n A$$^{2}$$\n \n \n 2\n \n E) for multimodal FAS self-supervised pre-training without costly annotated labels. Compared with the previous modality-symmetric autoencoder, the proposed M$$^{2}$$\n \n \n 2\n \n A$$^{2}$$\n \n \n 2\n \n E is able to learn more intrinsic task-aware representation and compatible with modality-agnostic (e.g., unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal) downstream settings. Extensive experiments with both unimodal (RGB, Depth, IR) and multimodal (RGB+Depth, RGB+IR, Depth+IR, RGB+Depth+IR) settings conducted on multimodal FAS benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods. One highlight is that the proposed method is robust under various missing-modality cases where previous multimodal FAS models suffer serious performance drops. We hope these findings and solutions can facilitate the future research for ViT-based multimodal FAS.",

By employing a feature pyramid structure, the system can effectively process multi-scale feature maps extracted by the Swin Transformer, thereby improving the detection accuracy for targets of different sizes and scales. Moreover, the integration of the CARAFE lightweight operator into the FPN structure enhances the network\u2019s detection accuracy. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, extensive experiments are conducted on a real dataset of students\u2019 classroom behavior.

        "abstract": "Automated classification of gastrointestinal endoscope images can help reduce the workload of doctors and improve the accuracy of diagnoses. The rapidly developed vision Transformer, represented by Swin Transformer, has become an impressive technique for medical image classification. However, Swin Transformer cannot capture the long-range dependency well in complex gastrointestinal endoscopy images. As a result, it fails to represent features of some widely-spread targets in digestive tract images, such as normal-z-line and esophagitis, effectively. To solve this problem, we propose a novel vision Transformer model based on hybrid shifted windows for digestive tract image classification, which can obtain both short-range and long-range dependency concurrently. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method to the state-of-the-art methods with a classification accuracy of 95.42% on the Kvasir v2 dataset and a classification accuracy of 86.81% on the HyperKvasir dataset.",

Due to the background clutter, pose variations, and scale changes, it is a challenge to construct a SAR ship detection model with low false-alarm rates and high accuracy. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel SAR ship detection model called ST-YOLOA. First, the Swin Transformer network architecture and coordinate attention (CA) model are embedded in the STCNet backbone network to enhance the feature extraction performance and capture global information. Second, we used the PANet path aggregation network with a residual structure to construct the feature pyramid to increase global feature extraction capability. Next, to cope with the local interference and semantic information loss problems, a novel up/down-sampling method is proposed. Finally, the decoupled detection head is used to achieve the predicted output of the target position and the boundary box to improve convergence speed and detection accuracy. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method, we have constructed three SAR ship detection datasets: a norm test set (NTS), a complex test set (CTS), and a merged test set (MTS). The experimental results show that our ST-YOLOA achieved an accuracy of 97.37%, 75.69%, and 88.50% on the three datasets, respectively, superior to the effects of other state-of-the-art methods. Our ST-YOLOA performs favorably in complex scenarios, and the accuracy is 4.83% higher than YOLOX on the CTS. Moreover, ST-YOLOA achieves real-time detection with a speed of 21.4 FPS.",

        "abstract": "White blood cells (WBCs) are crucial components of the immune system that play a vital role in defending the body against infections and diseases. The identification of WBCs subtypes is useful in the detection of various diseases, such as infections, leukemia, and other hematological malignancies. The manual screening of blood films is time-consuming and subjective, leading to inconsistencies and errors. Convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based models can automate such classification processes, but are incapable of capturing long-range dependencies and global context. This paper proposes an explainable Vision Transformer (ViT) model for automatic WBCs detection from blood films. The proposed model uses a self-attention mechanism to extract features from input images. Our proposed model was trained and validated on a public dataset of 16,633 samples containing five different types of WBCs. As a result of experiments on the classification of five different types of WBCs, our model achieved an accuracy of 99.40%. Moreover, the model\u2019s examination of misclassified test samples revealed a correlation between incorrect predictions and the presence or absence of granules in the cell samples. To validate this observation, we divided the dataset into two classes, Granulocytes and Agranulocytes, and conducted a secondary training process. The resulting ViT model, trained for binary classification, achieved impressive performance metrics during the test phase, including an accuracy of 99.70%, recall of 99.54%, precision of 99.32%, and F-1 score of 99.43%. To ensure the reliability of the ViT model\u2019s, we employed the Score-CAM algorithm to visualize the pixel areas on which the model focuses during its predictions. Our proposed method is suitable for clinical use due to its explainable structure as well as its superior performance compared to similar studies in the literature. The classification and localization of WBCs with this model can facilitate the detection and reporting process for the pathologist.",

Recent efforts have been devoted to incorporating transformer blocks into different neural architectures, including those with convolutions, leading to various visual transformers for computer vision tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel and compact transformer block, Transformer with Learnable Token Merging (LTM), or LTM-Transformer. LTM-Transformer performs token merging in a learnable scheme. LTM-Transformer is compatible with many popular and compact transformer networks, and it reduces the FLOPs and the inference time of the visual transformers while maintaining or even improving the prediction accuracy. In the experiments, we replace all the transformer blocks in popular visual transformers, including MobileViT, EfficientViT, ViT, and Swin, with LTM-Transformer blocks, leading to LTM-Transformer networks with different backbones. The LTM-Transformer is motivated by reduction of Information Bottleneck, and a novel and separable variational upper bound for the IB loss is derived. The architecture of the mask module in our LTM blocks which generates the token merging mask is designed to reduce the derived upper bound for the IB loss. Extensive results on computer vision tasks evidence that LTM-Transformer renders compact and efficient visual transformers with comparable or much better prediction accuracy than the original visual transformers.",

Current computing platforms like CPUs, GPUs, or FPGA-based solutions struggle to meet this deterministic low-latency real-time requirement, even with quantized ViT models. Some approaches use pruning or sparsity to reduce the model size and latency, but this often results in accuracy loss. To address the aforementioned constraints, in this work, we propose EQ-ViT, an end-to-end acceleration framework with the novel algorithm and architecture co-design features to enable the real-time ViT acceleration on the AMD Versal adaptive compute acceleration platform (ACAP). The contributions are four-fold. First, we perform in-depth kernel-level performance profiling and analysis and explain the bottlenecks for the existing acceleration solutions on GPU, FPGA, and ACAP. Second, on the hardware level, we introduce a new spatial and heterogeneous accelerator architecture, the EQ-ViT architecture. This architecture leverages the heterogeneous features of ACAP, where both FPGA and artificial intelligence engines (AIEs) coexist on the same system-on-chip (SoC). Third, On the algorithm level, we create a comprehensive quantization-aware training strategy, the EQ-ViT algorithm. This strategy concurrently quantizes both the weights and activations into 8-bit integers, aiming to improve the accuracy rather than compromise it during quantization. Notably, the method also quantizes nonlinear functions for efficient hardware implementation. Fourth, we design the EQ-ViT automation framework to implement the EQ-ViT architecture for four different ViT applications on the AMD Versal ACAP VCK190 board, achieving accuracy improvement with 2.4%, and average speedups of 315.0, 3.39, 3.38, 14.92, 59.5, and $13.1\\times $ over computing solutions of Intel Xeon 8375C vCPU, Nvidia A10G, A100, Jetson AGX Orin GPUs, AMD ZCU102, and U250 FPGAs.

By learning from the visual artifacts and latent data distribution, GenConViT achieves an improved performance in detecting a wide range of deepfake videos.

The proposed GenConViT model demonstrates strong performance in deepfake video detection, achieving high accuracy across the tested datasets.

These vision transformers heavily rely on large-scale pre-training to achieve competitive accuracy, which not only hinders the freedom of architectural design in downstream tasks like object detection, but also causes learning bias and domain mismatch in the fine-tuning stages. To this end, we aim to get rid of the \u201cpre-train & fine-tune\u201d paradigm of vision transformer and train transformer based object detector from scratch. Some earlier work in the CNNs era have successfully trained CNNs based detectors without pre-training, unfortunately, their findings do not generalize well when the backbone is switched from CNNs to vision transformer. Instead of proposing a specific vision transformer based detector, in this work, our goal is to reveal the insights of training vision transformer based detectors from scratch. In particular, we expect those insights can help other re-searchers and practitioners, and inspire more interesting research in other fields, such as semantic segmentation, visual-linguistic pre-training, etc. One of the key findings is that both architectural changes and more epochs play critical roles in training vision transformer based detectors from scratch.

In this paper, we propose a new attention mechanism in Transformer termed Cross Attention, which alternates attention inner the image patch instead of the whole image to capture local information and apply attention between image patches which are divided from single-channel feature maps to capture global information. Both operations have less computation than standard self-attention in Transformer. Based on that, we build a hierarchical network called Cross Attention Transformer(CAT) for other vision tasks.

This paper proposes and designs two transformer neural networks for human activity recognition: a recurrent transformer (ReT), a specialized neural network used to make predictions on sequences of data, as well as a vision transformer (ViT), a transformer optimized for extracting salient features from images, to improve speed and scalability of activity recognition. We have provided an extensive comparison of the proposed transformer neural networks with the contemporary CNN and RNN-based human activity recognition models in terms of speed and accuracy for four publicly available human action datasets. Experimental results reveal that the proposed ViT-ReT framework attains a speedup of $2\\times $ over the baseline ResNet50-LSTM approach while attaining nearly the same level of accuracy. Furthermore, results show that the proposed ViT-ReT framework attains significant improvements over the state-of-the-art human action recognition methods in terms of both model accuracy and runtime for each of the datasets used in our experiments, thus verifying the suitability of the proposed ViT-ReT framework for human activity recognition in resource-constrained and real-time environments.",

In this letter, a high-performance joint framework combined CNNs and vision transformer (ViT) (CTNet) is proposed to further boost the discriminative ability of features for HRRS scene classification. The CTNet method contains two modules, including the stream of ViT (T-stream) and the stream of CNNs (C-stream). For the T-stream, flattened image patches are sent into pretrained ViT model to mine semantic features in HRRS images. To complement with T-stream, pretrained CNN is transferred to extract local structural features in the C-stream. Then, semantic features and structural features are concatenated to predict labels of unknown samples. Finally, a joint loss function is developed to optimize the joint model and increase the intraclass aggregation. The highest accuracies on the aerial image dataset (AID) and Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU)-RESISC45 datasets obtained by the CTNet method are 97.70% and 95.49%, respectively. The classification results reveal that the proposed method achieves high classification performance compared with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.",

        "abstract": "Light-weight convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the de-facto for mobile vision tasks. Their spatial inductive biases allow them to learn representations with fewer parameters across different vision tasks. However, these networks are spatially local. To learn global representations, self-attention-based vision trans-formers (ViTs) have been adopted. Unlike CNNs, ViTs are heavy-weight. In this paper, we ask the following question: is it possible to combine the strengths of CNNs and ViTs to build a light-weight and low latency network for mobile vision tasks? Towards this end, we introduce MobileViT, a light-weight and general-purpose vision transformer for mobile devices. MobileViT presents a different perspective for the global processing of information with transformers, i.e., transformers as convolutions. Our results show that MobileViT significantly outperforms CNN- and ViT-based networks across different tasks and datasets. On the ImageNet-1k dataset, MobileViT achieves top-1 accuracy of 78.4% with about 6 million parameters, which is 3.2% and 6.2% more accurate than MobileNetv3 (CNN-based) and DeIT (ViT-based) for a similar number of parameters. On the MS-COCO object detection task, MobileViT is 5.7% more accurate than MobileNetv3 for a similar number of parameters.

        "abstract": "Vision Transformer(ViT) is one of the most widely used models in the computer vision field with its great performance on various tasks. In order to fully utilize the ViT-based architecture in various applications, proper visualization methods with a decent localization performance are necessary, but these methods employed in CNN-based models are still not available in ViT due to its unique structure. In this work, we propose an attention-guided visualization method applied to ViT that provides a high-level semantic explanation for its decision. Our method selectively aggregates the gradients directly propagated from the classification output to each self-attention, collecting the contribution of image features extracted from each location of the input image. These gradients are additionally guided by the normalized self-attention scores, which are the pairwise patch correlation scores. They are used to supplement the gradients on the patch-level context information efficiently detected by the self-attention mechanism. This approach of our method provides elaborate high-level semantic explanations with great localization performance only with the class labels. As a result, our method outperforms the previous leading explainability methods of ViT in the weakly-supervised localization task and presents great capability in capturing the full instances of the target class object. Meanwhile, our method provides a visualization that faithfully explains the model, which is demonstrated in the perturbation comparison test.",

However, most ViT-based works ignore the different learning performances of the heads in the multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanism and its layers. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel internal ensemble learning transformer (IELT) for FGVC. The proposed IELT involves three main modules: multi-head voting (MHV) module, cross-layer refinement (CLR) module, and dynamic selection (DS) module. To solve the problem of the inconsistent performances of multiple heads, we propose the MHV module, which considers all of the heads in each layer as weak learners and votes for tokens of discriminative regions as cross-layer feature based on the attention maps and spatial relationships. To effectively mine the cross-layer feature and suppress the noise, the CLR module is proposed, where the refined feature is extracted and the assist logits operation is developed for the final prediction. In addition, a newly designed DS module adjusts the token selection number at each layer by weighting their contributions of the refined feature. In this way, the idea of ensemble learning is combined with the ViT to improve fine-grained feature representation. The experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive results compared with the state of the art on five popular FGVC datasets.",

However, existing neural network architectures, including Vision Transformers (ViTs), are not designed or optimized for MPC and incur significant latency overhead. We observe Softmax accounts for the major latency bottleneck due to a high communication complexity, but can be selectively replaced or linearized without compromising the model accuracy. Hence, in this paper, we propose an MPC-friendly ViT, dubbed MPCViT, to enable accurate yet efficient ViT inference in MPC. Based on a systematic latency and accuracy evaluation of the Softmax attention and other attention variants, we propose a heterogeneous attention optimization space. We also develop a simple yet effective MPC-aware neural architecture search algorithm for fast Pareto optimization. To further boost the inference efficiency, we propose MPCViT+, to jointly optimize the Softmax attention and other network components, including GeLU, matrix multiplication, etc. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MPCViT achieves 1.9%, 1.3% and 3.6% higher accuracy with 6.2\u00d7, 2.9\u00d7 and 1.9\u00d7 latency reduction compared with baseline ViT, MPCFormer and THE-X on the Tiny-ImageNet dataset, respectively.

Many of the existing DL models are, however, designed to be applied on sparse sEMG signals. Furthermore, due to the complex structure of these models, typically, we are faced with memory constraint issues, require large training times and a large number of training samples, and; there is the need to resort to data augmentation and/or transfer learning. In this paper, for the first time (to the best of our knowledge), we investigate and design a Vision Transformer (ViT) based architecture to perform hand gesture recognition from High Density (HD-sEMG) signals. Intuitively speaking, we capitalize on the recent breakthrough role of the transformer architecture in tackling different com-plex problems together with its potential for employing more input parallelization via its attention mechanism. The proposed Vision Transformer-based Hand Gesture Recognition (ViT-HGR) framework can overcome the aforementioned training time problems and can accurately classify a large number of hand gestures from scratch without any need for data augmentation and/or transfer learning. The efficiency of the proposed ViT-HGR framework is evaluated using a recently-released HD-sEMG dataset consisting of 65 isometric hand gestures. Our experiments with 64-sample (31.25 ms) window size yield average test accuracy of 84.62 \u00b1 3.07%, where only 78,210 learnable parameters are utilized in the model. The compact structure of the proposed ViT-based ViT-HGR framework (i.e., having significantly reduced number of trainable parameters) shows great potentials for its practical application for prosthetic control.",

Previous ViT pruning methods tend to prune the model along one dimension solely, which may suffer from excessive reduction and lead to sub-optimal model quality. In contrast, we advocate a multi-dimensional ViT compression paradigm, and propose to harness the redundancy reduction from attention head, neuron and sequence dimensions jointly. Firstly, we propose a statistical dependence based pruning criterion that is generalizable to different dimensions for identifying the deleterious components. Moreover, we cast the multidimensional ViT compression as an optimization problem, objective of which is to learn an optimal pruning policy across the three dimensions while maximizing the compressed model\u2019s accuracy under a computational budget. The problem is solved by an adapted Gaussian process search with expected improvement. Experimental results show that our method effectively reduces the computational cost of various ViT models. For example, our method reduces 40% FLOPs without top-1 accuracy loss for DeiT and T2T-ViT models on the ImageNet dataset, outperforming previous state-of-the-art ViT pruning methods.",

Complex deep neural networks demonstrate significant performance advantages when classifying the radar micro-Doppler signals that have unique correspondences with human behavior.

In this paper, an efficient network based on a lightweight hybrid Vision Transformer (LH-ViT) is proposed to address the HAR accuracy and network lightweight simultaneously. This network combines the efficient convolution operations with the strength of the self-attention mechanism in ViT. Feature Pyramid architecture is applied for the multi-scale feature extraction for the micro-Doppler map. Feature enhancement is executed by the stacked Radar-ViT subsequently, in which the fold and unfold operations are added to lower the computational load of the attention mechanism. The convolution operator in the LH-ViT is replaced by the RES-SE block, an efficient structure that combines the residual learning framework with the Squeeze-and-Excitation network.

However, although Transformer-based backbones have achieved much progress on ImageNet classification, it is still unclear whether the learned representations are as transferable as or even more transferable than ConvNets\u2019 features. To address this point, we systematically investigate the transfer learning ability of ConvNets and vision transformers in 15 single-task and multi-task performance evaluations. We observe consistent advantages of Transformer-based backbones on 13 downstream tasks (out of 15), including but not limited to fine-grained classification, scene recognition (classification, segmentation and depth estimation), open-domain classification, face recognition, etc. More specifically, we find that two ViT models heavily rely on whole network fine-tuning to achieve performance gains while Swin Transformer does not have such a requirement. Moreover, vision transformers behave more robustly in multi-task learning, i.e., bringing more improvements when managing mutually beneficial tasks and reducing performance losses when tackling irrelevant tasks. We hope our discoveries can facilitate the exploration and exploitation of vision transformers in the future.",
