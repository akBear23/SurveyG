    "summary": "\n\n2. *Evolution Analysis:*\n\nThe evolution of Vision Transformers (ViTs) can be traced through two major trends: first, the foundational adaptation of the Transformer from NLP to vision, and second, the subsequent refinement and expansion of ViT capabilities to address its initial limitations and broaden its applicability across diverse vision tasks.\n\n*Trend 1: From NLP Foundation to Vision Dominance*\n- *Methodological progression*: The journey begins with **[Vaswani2017] Attention Is All You Need (2017)**, which introduced the Transformer architecture and the self-attention mechanism, revolutionizing sequence modeling in NLP. This foundational work established a powerful, parallelizable architecture capable of capturing long-range dependencies. The critical methodological leap for vision occurred with **[Dosovitskiy2021] An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale (2021)**. This paper directly adapted the Transformer by treating image patches as sequence tokens, applying the NLP-centric model to 2D visual data.\n- *Problem evolution*: **[Vaswani2017]** addressed the limitations of recurrent networks in handling long sequences and their sequential processing bottleneck. The challenge then became how to apply this powerful architecture to image data, traditionally dominated by CNNs. **[Dosovitskiy2021]** tackled this by formulating image recognition as a sequence-to-sequence problem, effectively challenging the long-held paradigm of convolutional feature extraction in computer vision.\n- *Key innovations*: The self-attention mechanism and the original Transformer architecture from **[Vaswani2017]** were the bedrock. **[Dosovitskiy2021]**'s key innovation was the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture itself, demonstrating that a pure Transformer could achieve state-of-the-art performance in image classification when trained on massive datasets, by using patch embeddings and positional embeddings for images.\n\n*Trend 2: Addressing ViT's Limitations & Expanding Capabilities*\n- *Methodological progression*: Following the initial success of ViT, subsequent research rapidly focused on improving its practical viability and versatility. **[Touvron2021] Training data-efficient image transformers & distillation through attention (2021)** introduced knowledge distillation to make ViTs less data-hungry. To overcome ViT's quadratic complexity and lack of hierarchical features, **[Liu2021] Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows (2021)** developed a hierarchical architecture with local, shifted window attention. Similarly, **[Wang2021] Pyramid Vision Transformer: A Versatile Backbone for Dense Prediction without Convolutions (2021)** proposed a pure Transformer-based pyramid structure for multi-scale feature generation. **[Yuan2021] Tokens-to-Token ViT: Training Vision Transformers from Scratch on ImageNet (2021)** refined the initial tokenization process to improve performance on smaller datasets. This rapid development led to a need for synthesis, resulting in surveys like **[Chen2021] When Vision Transformers Meet MEC: A Survey (2021)**, **[Han2022] A Survey of Vision Transformers (2022)**, and **[Khan2022] Transformers in Vision: A Survey (2022)**, which categorize and analyze the burgeoning field.\n- *Problem evolution*: The initial ViT faced several critical limitations: its requirement for massive datasets (addressed by **[Touvron2021]** and **[Yuan2021]**), its quadratic computational complexity for high-resolution images, and its inability to generate multi-scale feature maps essential for dense prediction tasks (addressed by **[Liu2021]** and **[Wang2021]**). As ViTs matured, the problem shifted to practical deployment in resource-constrained environments, which **[Chen2021]** began to survey. The sheer volume of new architectures and applications also created a need for comprehensive overviews, leading to the broader surveys by **[Han2022]** and **[Khan2022]**.\n- *Key innovations*: **[Touvron2021]**'s DeiT enabled data-efficient training. **[Liu2021]**'s Swin Transformer introduced hierarchical feature maps and shifted window attention, making ViTs suitable for dense prediction. **[Wang2021]**'s PVT offered an alternative pure Transformer backbone for multi-scale feature extraction. **[Yuan2021]**'s T2T module improved initial token representation, boosting performance on standard datasets. The surveys by **[Chen2021]**, **[Han2022]**, and **[Khan2022]** represent a meta-innovation: the systematic organization and analysis of a rapidly evolving field, identifying trends, challenges, and future directions.\n\n3. *Synthesis*:\nThese works collectively trace the journey of the Transformer from an NLP innovation to a dominant paradigm in computer vision, systematically addressing its initial limitations to enhance efficiency, versatility, and practical applicability. Their unified intellectual trajectory is the continuous adaptation and optimization of the self-attention mechanism for visual tasks, culminating in a robust and diverse ecosystem of Vision Transformer architectures. Their collective contribution to advancing \"A survey on Visual Transformer\" is to provide the foundational models, key architectural improvements, and comprehensive syntheses that define the field's landscape and future research directions.",

US preserves equivalent elements across multiple non-overlapped local windows, resulting in the smooth support for popular Pyramid-based ViTs; whilst SM is designed for better transferable visual representations since US reduces the difficulty of pixel recovery pre-task that hinders the semantic learning. We demonstrate that UM-MAE significantly improves the pre-training efficiency (e.g., it speeds up and reduces the GPU memory by $\\sim 2\\times$) of Pyramid-based ViTs, but maintains the competitive fine-tuning performance across downstream tasks. For example using HTC++ detector, the pre-trained Swin-Large backbone self-supervised under UM-MAE only in ImageNet-1K can even outperform the one supervised in ImageNet-22K.

The previous methods generally address the core problem of visual grounding, i.e., multi-modal fusion and reasoning, with manually-designed mechanisms. Such heuristic designs are not only complicated but also make models easily overfit specific data distributions. To avoid this, we first propose TransVG, which establishes multi-modal correspondences by Transformers and localizes referred regions by directly regressing box coordinates. We empirically show that complicated fusion modules can be replaced by a simple stack of Transformer encoder layers with higher performance. However, the core fusion Transformer in TransVG is stand-alone against uni-modal encoders, and thus should be trained from scratch on limited visual grounding data, which makes it hard to be optimized and leads to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we further introduce TransVG++ to make two-fold improvements. For one thing, we upgrade our framework to a purely Transformer-based one by leveraging Vision Transformer (ViT) for vision feature encoding. For another, we devise Language Conditioned Vision Transformer that removes external fusion modules and reuses the uni-modal ViT for vision-language fusion at the intermediate layers. We conduct extensive experiments on five prevalent datasets, and report a series of state-of-the-art records.",

To address this issue, window-based self-attention ViT limits attention area to a specific window, thereby mitigating the computational complexity.

    "summary": "\n\n2. *Evolution Analysis:*\n\nThe evolution of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using radar data, as contextualized by \"[huan202345b] A lightweight hybrid vision transformer network for radar-based human activity recognition (2023)\", reveals two major trends: first, a fundamental shift from traditional, feature-engineered methods to sophisticated deep learning architectures, culminating in Vision Transformers; and second, a subsequent drive to optimize these powerful models for efficiency and deployment in resource-constrained environments.\n\n*Trend 1: The Shift from Feature Engineering to Deep Learning and Global Context for HAR*\n- *Methodological progression*: Early approaches to radar-based HAR relied on *traditional classification techniques* such as Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). These methods necessitated *manually extracted micro-Doppler features* from radar signals. This represented a foundational stage where human expertise was crucial for feature engineering. The field then progressed significantly with the advent of *deep learning (DL) techniques*, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). These models marked a major methodological shift by automatically extracting features from raw or minimally processed radar data (like micro-Doppler maps), thereby overcoming the limitations imposed by prior knowledge and task intricacy inherent in traditional methods. The most recent significant progression in this trend is the adoption of *Transformers*, specifically *Vision Transformers (ViT)*, which leverage self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies across the entire micro-Doppler map, offering a more holistic understanding of activity patterns.\n- *Problem evolution*: Traditional methods were limited by their reliance on expert-defined features and struggled with the increasing intricacy of HAR tasks. While deep learning methods like CNNs and RNNs addressed the problem of automatic feature extraction, they often introduced new challenges related to computational burden or, in the case of lightweight CNNs, a decline in recognition accuracy due to missed details. The introduction of *conventional ViT* aimed to solve the problem of capturing global features for higher accuracy but, in turn, presented a significant challenge: a large number of parameters and high computational cost, making them impractical for embedded applications.\n- *Key innovations*: The key innovations in this trend include the development of algorithms for *automatic feature learning* (CNNs, RNNs) and the application of *global self-attention mechanisms* (ViT) to image-like data, enabling models to learn more complex and context-rich representations of human activities.\n\n*Trend 2: Optimizing Vision Transformers for Resource-Constrained HAR*\n- *Methodological progression*: Following the establishment of ViT as a powerful, albeit computationally intensive, architecture, the research trajectory shifted towards optimizing these models for practical deployment. This involved moving beyond *conventional ViT* and *lightweight CNNs* (which often compromised accuracy) towards hybrid and highly efficient architectures. The paper \"[huan202345b] A lightweight hybrid vision transformer network for radar-based human activity recognition (2023)\" exemplifies this trend by proposing a *Lightweight Hybrid Vision Transformer (LH-ViT)*. This architecture represents a sophisticated methodological integration, combining efficient convolution operations with a significantly optimized self-attention mechanism.\n- *Problem evolution*: The primary problem addressed by this trend is the critical trade-off between achieving high HAR accuracy and ensuring the network is lightweight and has low latency, especially for embedded applications. Conventional ViT models, while accurate, were computationally burdensome. Existing lightweight solutions, often based on CNNs, frequently compromised recognition accuracy by missing fine-grained details. [huan202345b] directly tackles this by aiming for both high accuracy and reduced computational load.\n- *Key innovations*: The LH-ViT introduces several breakthrough contributions. It employs a *Feature Pyramid architecture* for multi-scale feature extraction, enhancing representational power. A novel *efficient RES-SE block* replaces traditional convolutions, utilizing depthwise separable convolutions within a residual learning framework and incorporating a lightweight Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) network for adaptive channel weight adjustment, significantly reducing computational overhead. Crucially, the paper introduces *Radar-ViT*, a lightweight design of ViT that simplifies the class token module to a point-wise convolution and uses *fold and unfold operations* to drastically reduce the computational demands of the multi-head attention block, enabling efficient capture of global micro-Doppler features. These innovations collectively allow for efficient HAR at different Doppler scales while significantly reducing parameter count compared to conventional ViT.\n\n3. *Synthesis*\nThe intellectual trajectory connecting these conceptual stages, culminating in \"[huan202345b] A lightweight hybrid vision transformer network for radar-based human activity recognition (2023)\", is a continuous pursuit of more accurate, robust, and increasingly efficient methods for radar-based HAR. Their collective contribution to advancing \"A survey on Visual Transformer\" lies in demonstrating how to effectively adapt and optimize the powerful global feature learning capabilities of Vision Transformers for resource-constrained embedded systems, particularly by integrating them with efficient convolutional structures to balance accuracy and computational cost.",

        "abstract": "Remote sensing image classification (RSIC) is a classical and fundamental task in the intelligent interpretation of remote sensing imagery, which can provide unique labeling information for each acquired remote sensing image. Thanks to the potent global context information extraction ability of the multi-head self-attention (MSA) mechanism, visual transformer (ViT)-based architectures have shown excellent capability in natural scene image classification. However, in order to achieve powerful RSIC performance, it is insufficient to capture global spatial information alone. Specifically, for fine-grained target recognition tasks with high inter-class similarity, discriminative and effective local feature representations are key to correct classification. In addition, due to the lack of inductive biases, the powerful global spatial context representation capability of ViT requires lengthy training procedures and large-scale pre-training data volume. To solve the above problems, a hybrid architecture of convolution neural network (CNN) and ViT is proposed to improve the RSIC ability, called P2FEViT, which integrates plug-and-play CNN features with ViT. In this paper, the feature representation capabilities of CNN and ViT applying for RSIC are first analyzed. Second, aiming to integrate the advantages of CNN and ViT, a novel approach embedding CNN features into the ViT architecture is proposed, which can make the model synchronously capture and fuse global context and local multimodal information to further improve the classification capability of ViT. Third, based on the hybrid structure, only a simple cross-entropy loss is employed for model training. The model can also have rapid and comfortable convergence with relatively less training data than the original ViT. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on the public and challenging remote sensing scene classification dataset of NWPU-RESISC45 (NWPU-R45) and the self-built fine-grained target classification dataset called BIT-AFGR50. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed P2FEViT can effectively improve the feature description capability and obtain outstanding image classification performance, while significantly reducing the high dependence of ViT on large-scale pre-training data volume and accelerating the convergence speed.

Complex deep neural networks demonstrate significant performance advantages when classifying the radar micro-Doppler signals that have unique correspondences with human behavior. However, in embedded applications, the demand for lightweight and low latency poses challenges to the radar-based HAR network construction. In this paper, an efficient network based on a lightweight hybrid Vision Transformer (LH-ViT) is proposed to address the HAR accuracy and network lightweight simultaneously. This network combines the efficient convolution operations with the strength of the self-attention mechanism in ViT. Feature Pyramid architecture is applied for the multi-scale feature extraction for the micro-Doppler map. Feature enhancement is executed by the stacked Radar-ViT subsequently, in which the fold and unfold operations are added to lower the computational load of the attention mechanism. The convolution operator in the LH-ViT is replaced by the RES-SE block, an efficient structure that combines the residual learning framework with the Squeeze-and-Excitation network.

This network combines efficient convolution operations with the self-attention mechanism of ViT.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:**\n        *   It employs a Feature Pyramid architecture for multi-scale feature extraction from micro-Doppler maps.\n        *   Feature enhancement is performed by stacked Radar-ViT modules, which incorporate fold and unfold operations to significantly reduce the computational load of the attention mechanism.\n        *   The traditional convolution operator is replaced by an efficient RES-SE block, which combines a residual learning framework with a Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) network and uses depthwise separable convolutions \\cite{huan202345b}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods:**\n        *   Development of a novel Lightweight Hybrid Vision Transformer (LH-ViT) that integrates a pyramid-structured feature extraction network with a stacked Radar-ViT feature enhancement network, enhancing representational power through spatial attention in the micro-Doppler feature hierarchy \\cite{huan202345b}.\n        *   Design of an efficient RES-SE block that replaces traditional convolution. This block uses depthwise separable convolutions within a residual learning framework and incorporates a lightweight SE module for adaptive channel weight adjustment, reducing computational overhead \\cite{huan202345b}.\n        *   Introduction of Radar-ViT, a lightweight design of ViT for embedded applications. It simplifies the class token module to a point-wise convolution and uses fold and unfold operations to reduce the computational demands of the multi-head attention block, effectively capturing global micro-Doppler features \\cite{huan202345b}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** Experiments were performed on two human activity datasets: a public C-band radar dataset (5 activities: walking, sitting, standing up, bending, drinking) and a self-established 79 GHz mmWave radar dataset (5 activities: walking, running, standing up after squatting, bending, turning) \\cite{huan202345b}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results:** The experiments demonstrated the LH-ViT method's advantages in terms of expressiveness and computing efficiency compared to traditional methods \\cite{huan202345b}. The paper claims the method achieves efficient HAR at different Doppler scales and significantly reduces parameter count while maintaining accuracy compared to conventional ViT \\cite{huan202345b}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The primary focus is on radar-based HAR using micro-Doppler signals. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated on specific human activities and radar bands (C-band and 79 GHz mmWave). The paper implies that the \"lightweight\" aspect is relative to larger ViT models and deep learning networks, but specific trade-offs in extreme resource-constrained environments are not detailed in the provided text.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The proposed LH-ViT is designed for embedded applications requiring efficient and accurate human activity recognition using radar data \\cite{huan202345b}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** The LH-ViT advances the technical state-of-the-art by effectively addressing the critical trade-off between HAR accuracy and network lightweightness for radar-based systems \\cite{huan202345b}. It demonstrates how to leverage the strengths of both convolutional networks (for local feature extraction and efficiency) and Vision Transformers (for global feature capture via self-attention) in a highly optimized, hybrid architecture.\n    *   **Potential Impact:** This work has the potential to enable the deployment of high-performance radar-based HAR systems in resource-constrained embedded environments, expanding applications in intelligent healthcare, smart homes, and security where privacy and robustness are paramount \\cite{huan202345b}.",

However, when applied to remote sensing images (RSIs), existing methods often necessitate extensive modifications of ViTs to rival convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This requirement significantly impedes the application of ViTs in geosciences, particularly for researchers who lack the time for comprehensive model redesign. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of quantitative regularization (QR), designed to enhance the performance of ViTs in RSI classification. QR represents an effective algorithm that adeptly manages domain discrepancies in RSIs and can be integrated with any ViTs in transfer learning. We evaluated the effectiveness of QR using three ViT architectures: vanilla ViT, Swin‐ViT and Next‐ViT, on four datasets: AID30, NWPU45, AFGR50 and UCM21. The results reveal that our Next‐ViT model surpasses 39 other advanced methods published in the past 3 years, maintaining robust performance even with a limited number of training samples. We also discovered that our ViT and Swin‐ViT achieve significantly higher accuracy and robustness compared to other methods using the same backbone. Our findings confirm that ViTs can be as effective as CNNs for RSI classification, regardless of the dataset size.

        "abstract": "Recently, vision transformer (ViT)-based deep learning (DL) models have achieved remarkable performance gains in hyperspectral image classification (HSIC) due to their abilities to model long-range dependencies and extract global spatial features. However, ViT is built with a stack of Transformer blocks and faces the challenge of learning a large number of parameters when processing hyperspectral data. Besides, the inherent modeling of global correlation in Transformer ignores the effective representation of local spatial and spectral features. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight ViT network known as groupwise separable convolutional ViT (GSC-ViT). First, a groupwise separable convolution (GSC) module, which is a combination of grouped pointwise convolution (GPWC) and group convolution, is designed to significantly decrease the number of convolutional kernel parameters, and effectively capture local spectral–spatial information in hyperspectral image (HSI). Second, a groupwise separable multihead self-attention (GSSA) module is employed to substitute the conventional multihead self-attention (MSA) in ViT, in which the groupwise self-attention (GSA) provides local spatial feature extraction, and the pointwise self-attention (PWSA) provides global spatial feature extraction. Third, a simple pointwise layer with enhanced skip connection mechanism is employed to substitute the multilayer perceptron (MLP) layer in all Transformer blocks of ViT, so as to eliminate unnecessary nonlinear transformations and facilitate the fusion of features derived from GSC and GSSA modules. Extensive experiments on four benchmark hyperspectral datasets reveal that our GSC-ViT can achieve surprising classification performance with relatively few training samples as compared with some existing HSIC approaches.

        "abstract": "The pretrain-then-finetune paradigm has been widely adopted in computer vision. But as the size of Vision Transformer (ViT) grows exponentially, the full finetuning becomes prohibitive in view of the heavier storage overhead. Motivated by parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) on language transformers, recent studies attempt to insert lightweight adaptation modules (e.g., adapter layers or prompt tokens) to pretrained ViT and only finetune these modules while the pretrained weights are frozen. However, these modules were originally proposed to finetune language models and did not take into account the prior knowledge specifically for visual tasks. In this paper, we propose to construct Convolutional Bypasses (Convpass) in ViT as adaptation modules, introducing only a small amount (less than 0.5% of model parameters) of trainable parameters to adapt the large ViT. Different from other PETL methods, Convpass benefits from the hard-coded inductive bias of convolutional layers and thus is more suitable for visual tasks, especially in the low-data regime. Experimental results on VTAB-1K benchmark and few-shot learning datasets show that Convpass outperforms current language-oriented adaptation modules, demonstrating the necessity to tailor vision-oriented adaptation modules for adapting vision models.",

To this end, we propose a novel multimodal deep learning framework by extending conventional ViT with minimal modifications, aiming at the task of land use and land cover (LULC) classification.

Therefore, this analysis will interpret the provided paper's contribution by contrasting it with the \"Related Work & Positioning\" it describes, treating those as the implicit \"previous contributions\" it builds upon and addresses.\n\n1.  **Chronological Progression Analysis:**\n\n    *   **[huan202345b] A lightweight hybrid vision transformer network for radar-based human activity recognition (2023)**\n        *   **Methodological/Conceptual Shift:** This paper introduces a significant methodological shift towards **hybrid, lightweight Vision Transformer architectures** tailored for resource-constrained environments. It moves beyond the limitations of large, computationally intensive pure ViT models and the accuracy compromises of purely lightweight CNNs. The core conceptual shift is the intelligent integration of efficient convolutional operations (for local feature extraction and efficiency) with a highly optimized self-attention mechanism (for global feature capture).\n        *   **Problems Addressed:**\n            *   **Computational Burden of Standard ViTs:** Addresses the challenge that traditional Vision Transformers (ViT), while accurate, possess a large number of parameters, making them impractical for deployment in embedded systems for radar-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR).\n            *   **Accuracy Decline in Lightweight CNNs:** Solves the problem where existing lightweight CNN solutions for HAR often sacrifice recognition accuracy by failing to capture sufficient detail or global context.\n            *   **Dual Requirement of High Accuracy and Low Latency:** Tackles the critical trade-off of simultaneously achieving high HAR accuracy and ensuring the network is lightweight and has low latency, which is essential for real-time embedded applications.\n        *   **Innovations/Capabilities Introduced:**\n            *   **Lightweight Hybrid Vision Transformer (LH-ViT):** A novel network architecture that combines a Feature Pyramid for multi-scale feature extraction with stacked Radar-ViT modules for enhanced feature processing.\n            *   **Efficient RES-SE Block:** Replaces traditional convolution operators with a block that uses depthwise separable convolutions within a residual learning framework, augmented by a lightweight Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) module for adaptive channel weighting, thereby significantly reducing computational overhead.\n            *   **Radar-ViT Module:** A specifically designed lightweight ViT for embedded applications. It simplifies the class token module to a point-wise convolution and employs fold and unfold operations to drastically reduce the computational demands of the multi-head attention block, enabling efficient capture of global micro-Doppler features.\n            *   **Multi-scale Feature Extraction:** Incorporates a Feature Pyramid architecture to extract and process features at various scales, enhancing the model's robustness and representational power.\n        *   **Temporal Gaps/Clusters:** Not applicable as only one paper is provided. The paper implicitly builds upon the general advancements in both convolutional neural networks and Vision Transformers that have emerged in recent years.\n\n2.  *Evolution Analysis:*\n\n    *Trend 1: Optimizing Vision Transformers for Resource-Constrained Human Activity Recognition*\n\n    *   *Methodological progression*: The evolution in this context, as represented by \"[huan202345b] A lightweight hybrid vision transformer network for radar-based human activity recognition (2023)\", marks a significant methodological progression from earlier, more generalized deep learning approaches for Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Previously, methods included traditional classification techniques (e.g., MLP, PCA, SVM) and deep learning models like CNNs, RNNs, and early Vision Transformers (ViT). While CNNs offered some efficiency and RNNs handled sequential data, ViTs, known for their global feature capture via self-attention, often came with a prohibitive number of parameters. Lightweight CNNs attempted to address efficiency but frequently compromised accuracy. The paper by [huan202345b] introduces a **hybrid methodology** that strategically combines the strengths of both convolutional networks (for local feature extraction and efficiency) and Vision Transformers (for global context) into a highly optimized architecture. This is exemplified by the integration of efficient RES-SE blocks for local processing and the novel Radar-ViT module for global attention, moving beyond the limitations of purely monolithic or overly simplified architectures.\n\n    *   *Problem evolution*: The problem landscape for HAR has evolved from simply achieving high accuracy to demanding high accuracy *under severe computational constraints*. Earlier works focused on improving recognition rates, often at the expense of model complexity. As applications shifted towards embedded systems in intelligent healthcare and smart homes, the critical problem became the trade-off between accuracy and computational lightweightness and low latency. [huan202345b] directly addresses this evolved problem. It tackles the specific technical challenge of making powerful ViT-like architectures viable for radar-based HAR in embedded environments, where large parameter counts of conventional ViTs are unfeasible, and the accuracy drop of existing lightweight CNNs is unacceptable. The paper explicitly aims to bridge this gap, ensuring both high recognition performance and operational efficiency.\n\n    *   *Key innovations*: The paper introduces several key innovations that enable this progression. The **Lightweight Hybrid Vision Transformer (LH-ViT)** architecture itself is a breakthrough, integrating a Feature Pyramid for multi-scale feature extraction with stacked Radar-ViT modules. A crucial innovation is the **Radar-ViT module**, which re-engineers the self-attention mechanism by using fold and unfold operations to drastically reduce its computational load, making global feature capture efficient enough for embedded systems. Furthermore, the **efficient RES-SE block** replaces traditional convolutions with depthwise separable convolutions and a lightweight Squeeze-and-Excitation module, significantly cutting down parameter count and computational overhead without sacrificing representational power. These innovations collectively enable the deployment of sophisticated, high-accuracy HAR models in resource-constrained settings, a capability previously challenging to achieve.\n\n3.  *Synthesis*\n\n    This work, \"[huan202345b] A lightweight hybrid vision transformer network for radar-based human activity recognition (2023)\", represents a crucial step in adapting powerful Vision Transformer concepts for practical, resource-constrained applications. Its collective contribution to advancing \"A survey on Visual Transformer\" lies in demonstrating how to meticulously optimize and hybridize ViT architectures to overcome their inherent computational demands, thereby extending their applicability to real-world embedded systems requiring both high accuracy and efficiency in domains like radar-based human activity recognition.",

    "summary": "1. **Integration Analysis:**\n\nThe newly introduced papers significantly extend and refine the previously identified evolutionary trends, particularly strengthening the first trend concerning foundational adaptation, architectural generalization, and pre-training paradigms. They introduce several new methodological and conceptual shifts, pushing the boundaries of Vision Transformers (ViTs) towards \"Foundation Models\" and hybrid architectures.\n\n-   **Relation to Previous Trends:**\n    *   **Trend 1 (From NLP Foundation to Vision Adaptation & Architectural Generalization):** All new papers directly contribute to and substantially advance this trend. They focus on scaling ViTs to unprecedented sizes (`[ICLR2023] Scaling Vision Transformers to 1 Billion Parameters (2023)`), enhancing self-supervised learning for robust feature extraction (`[ICLR2023] DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision (2023)`), developing hybrid architectures that combine CNN and Transformer strengths (`[ICLR2023] ConvNeXt V2: Co-designing and Scaling ConvNets with Masked Autoencoders (2023)`, `[CVPR2023] InternImage: Exploring Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models with Deformable Convolutions (2023)`), and improving efficiency for practical deployment (`[ICCV2023] MobileViT V2: Local-Global-Feature Interaction for Efficient and Large-Scale Vision Transformers (2023)`). These contributions deepen the understanding of how to build powerful, general-purpose visual backbones.\n    *   **Trend 2 (Diversification and Specialization for Comprehensive Vision Understanding):** While none of the new papers directly introduce novel task-specific ViT architectures for dense prediction or other specialized tasks, their foundational improvements (larger models, better pre-training, more robust features, efficient designs) *implicitly* and *significantly* enhance the performance and applicability of ViTs across *all* downstream tasks outlined in Trend 2. They provide stronger, more versatile backbones for future specialization.\n\n-   **New Methodological or Conceptual Shifts:**\n    *   **Vision Foundation Models:** A major conceptual shift is the emergence of \"Vision Foundation Models,\" exemplified by `[ICLR2023] Scaling Vision Transformers to 1 Billion Parameters (2023)` and `[CVPR2023] InternImage: Exploring Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models with Deformable Convolutions (2023)`. This moves beyond individual architectural improvements to creating massive, general-purpose models pre-trained on vast datasets, intended to serve as versatile backbones for a wide array of tasks with minimal fine-tuning.\n    *   **Advanced Self-Supervised Learning for Robustness:** `[ICLR2023] DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision (2023)` pushes self-supervised learning beyond just pre-training efficiency (as with MAE) to explicitly learning highly robust and generalizable visual features, reducing the need for labeled data even further and improving transferability.\n    *   **Hybrid Architectures and CNN-Transformer Convergence:** `[ICLR2023] ConvNeXt V2: Co-designing and Scaling ConvNets with Masked Autoencoders (2023)` and `[CVPR2023] InternImage: Exploring Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models with Deformable Convolutions (2023)` highlight a strong trend of integrating the inductive biases and strengths of CNNs (e.g., locality, deformable convolutions) with the global context modeling and scalability of Transformers, often leveraging Transformer-inspired pre-training techniques like Masked Autoencoders. This signifies a move away from a \"Transformer vs. CNN\" dichotomy towards synergistic designs.\n    *   **Efficiency for Real-World Deployment:** `[ICCV2023] MobileViT V2: Local-Global-Feature Interaction for Efficient and Large-Scale Vision Transformers (2023)` emphasizes the growing importance of designing efficient ViT variants suitable for mobile and edge devices, balancing performance with computational constraints.\n\n-   **Gaps Filled or New Directions Opened:**\n    *   The previous synthesis highlighted the data-hungry nature of early ViTs and `[CVPR2022] Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners (2022)` as a solution. The new papers `[ICLR2023] Scaling Vision Transformers to 1 Billion Parameters (2023)` and `[ICLR2023] DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision (2023)` *deepen* this solution by demonstrating the power of scaling and advanced self-supervised learning to create even more robust and data-efficient models.\n    *   The concept of \"Vision Foundation Models\" is a new, overarching direction that aims to create universal visual intelligence, moving beyond task-specific model development.\n    *   The hybrid architecture trend opens new avenues for optimal model design, suggesting that the best solutions might lie in combining the strengths of different paradigms.\n\n-   **Connections between New Papers and Earlier Works:**\n    *   `[ICLR2023] Scaling Vision Transformers to 1 Billion Parameters (2023)` directly builds upon the original ViT `[ICLR2019] An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale (2021)` and the self-supervised pre-training paradigm of MAE `[CVPR2022] Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners (2022)`.\n    *   `[ICLR2023] ConvNeXt V2: Co-designing and Scaling ConvNets with Masked Autoencoders (2023)` explicitly leverages the MAE pre-training strategy `[CVPR2022] Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners (2022)` to enhance CNNs, demonstrating cross-paradigm influence.\n    *   `[ICLR2023] DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision (2023)` extends the self-supervised learning trajectory, building on prior works like DINO and implicitly addressing the data efficiency problem tackled by MAE.\n    *   `[CVPR2023] InternImage: Exploring Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models with Deformable Convolutions (2023)` combines the architectural principles of ViTs with CNN elements (deformable convolutions), showing a synthesis of ideas from both domains.\n    *   `[ICCV2023] MobileViT V2: Local-Global-Feature Interaction for Efficient and Large-Scale Vision Transformers (2023)` continues the line of architectural refinements seen in papers like `[ICLR2021] Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows (2021)` but with a specific focus on efficiency for mobile deployment.\n\n-   **Change in Overall Narrative:**\n    The overall narrative shifts from establishing ViTs as a viable alternative to CNNs and then adapting them to various tasks, to a more ambitious goal of creating *universal, robust, and efficient visual intelligence*. The focus is now on *how to scale and pre-train models effectively* (often with self-supervision and hybrid designs) to create powerful \"foundation models\" that can generalize across an extremely broad range of vision tasks, rather than just optimizing for individual tasks. The \"Transformer vs. CNN\" debate has largely evolved into a \"Transformer *and* CNN\" synergy.\n\n**Temporal Positioning:**\nAll new papers are from 2023, positioning them as the latest developments in the field, following the 2021-2022 papers in the previous synthesis. They represent the current cutting edge of research in Vision Transformers and related architectures.\n\n---\n\n2. **Updated Evolution Analysis:**\n\nThe evolution of research from \"A survey on Visual Transformer\" continues to demonstrate a rapid and profound intellectual trajectory, now extending beyond the initial adaptation and diversification to focus on the creation of highly scalable, robust, and universally applicable \"Vision Foundation Models.\" This progression can be understood through two evolving trends: first, the foundational adaptation, architectural refinement, and scaling of Transformers for vision, now encompassing hybrid designs and advanced self-supervised learning; and second, the continued diversification and specialization, now significantly empowered by these more powerful foundational models.\n\n*Trend 1: From NLP Foundation to Vision Adaptation, Architectural Generalization, and Foundation Models*\n\n-   *Methodological progression*: The journey began with **[NIPS2017] Attention Is All You Need (2017)**, establishing the Transformer. This was directly applied to images by **[ICLR2019] An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale (2021)**, treating images as sequences of patches. Subsequent architectural refinements, such as **[ICLR2021] Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows (2021)** and **[ICCV2021] Pyramid Vision Transformer: A Feature Pyramid Network for Vision Transformers (2021)**, introduced hierarchical structures and multi-scale feature generation to address computational complexity and better model visual hierarchies. **[CVPR2022] Focal Attention for Long-Range Dependencies in Vision Transformers (2022)** further optimized attention. A pivotal methodological shift for training came with **[CVPR2022] Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners (2022)**, introducing efficient self-supervised pre-training.\n    This trend is significantly extended by the 2023 papers. **[ICLR2023] Scaling Vision Transformers to 1 Billion Parameters (2023)** pushes the architectural scale of ViTs to unprecedented levels, demonstrating the efficacy of massive models when combined with advanced pre-training. Concurrently, **[ICLR2023] DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision (2023)** refines self-supervised learning methodologies, moving beyond just efficiency to explicitly learn highly robust and generalizable visual features without supervision. A notable methodological shift is the emergence of hybrid architectures: **[ICLR2023] ConvNeXt V2: Co-designing and Scaling ConvNets with Masked Autoencoders (2023)** demonstrates how CNNs can be significantly enhanced by adopting Transformer-inspired self-supervised pre-training (MAE), while **[CVPR2023] InternImage: Exploring Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models with Deformable Convolutions (2023)** integrates deformable convolutions (a CNN strength) into large-scale Transformer-like architectures, aiming for universal foundation models. Furthermore, **[ICCV2023] MobileViT V2: Local-Global-Feature Interaction for Efficient and Large-Scale Vision Transformers (2023)** focuses on architectural designs for efficiency, enabling practical deployment on resource-constrained devices.\n\n-   *Problem evolution*: Initially, the problem was applying Transformers to images for classification, as by **[ICLR2019] An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale (2021)**. This evolved into addressing ViT's high computational cost, quadratic complexity, and lack of inherent multi-scale representation, tackled by **[ICLR2021] Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows (2021)** and **[ICCV2021] Pyramid Vision Transformer: A Feature Pyramid Network for Vision Transformers (2021)**. The data-hungry nature of early ViTs was a major bottleneck, which **[CVPR2022] Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners (2022)** addressed.\n    The new papers tackle the problem of achieving *universal applicability, extreme robustness, and efficiency at scale*. **[ICLR2023] Scaling Vision Transformers to 1 Billion Parameters (2023)** addresses the challenge of scaling models to unprecedented sizes for broader generalization. **[ICLR2023] DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision (2023)** solves the problem of learning highly transferable features that are robust across diverse downstream tasks without relying on extensive labeled data. The hybrid approaches in **[ICLR2023] ConvNeXt V2: Co-designing and Scaling ConvNets with Masked Autoencoders (2023)** and **[CVPR2023] InternImage: Exploring Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models with Deformable Convolutions (2023)** address the problem of combining the best inductive biases of CNNs with the global modeling capabilities and scalability of Transformers to create more powerful and versatile backbones. **[ICCV2023] MobileViT V2: Local-Global-Feature Interaction for Efficient and Large-Scale Vision Transformers (2023)** specifically targets the problem of deploying these powerful models efficiently on mobile and edge devices.\n\n-   *Key innovations*: The original Transformer from **[NIPS2017] Attention Is All You Need (2017)** and the pioneering ViT by **[ICLR2019] An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale (2021)** were foundational. **[ICLR2021] Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows (2021)** introduced shifted window attention, and **[CVPR2022] Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners (2022)** delivered a breakthrough in self-supervised pre-training.\n    The 2023 papers introduce several key innovations: **[ICLR2023] Scaling Vision Transformers to 1 Billion Parameters (2023)** demonstrates the viability and benefits of billion-parameter ViTs. **[ICLR2023] DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision (2023)** provides a new benchmark for learning robust, general-purpose visual features without supervision. **[ICLR2023] ConvNeXt V2: Co-designing and Scaling ConvNets with Masked Autoencoders (2023)** innovates by showing the power of MAE pre-training for CNNs, bridging the gap between the two architectures. **[CVPR2023] InternImage: Exploring Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models with Deformable Convolutions (2023)** introduces a novel hybrid architecture for large-scale foundation models, combining deformable convolutions with Transformer principles. **[ICCV2023] MobileViT V2: Local-Global-Feature Interaction for Efficient and Large-Scale Vision Transformers (2023)** offers an efficient architectural design for mobile deployment, balancing global and local feature interaction.\n\n-   *Integration points*: The 2023 works directly build upon the self-supervised pre-training paradigm established by **[CVPR2022] Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners (2022)**, scaling it up and refining it for greater robustness and generalization. They also extend the architectural innovations of earlier ViTs (e.g., **[ICLR2019] An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale (2021)**, **[ICLR2021] Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows (2021)**) by exploring extreme scaling, hybrid designs, and efficiency-focused modifications.\n\n*Trend 2: Diversification and Specialization for Comprehensive Vision Understanding (Empowered by Foundation Models)*\n\n-   *Methodological progression*: Building upon the generalized ViT backbones, this trend saw rapid expansion into task-specific adaptations. **[ICLR2022] Vision Transformer for Dense Prediction (2022)** began to consolidate strategies for adapting ViTs to pixel-level tasks, leading to end-to-end architectures like **[CVPR2022] Max-DeepLab: End-to-End Transformer for Semantic Segmentation (2022)**. The cluster of ECCV 2022 papers ([ECCV2022] Vision Transformer for Object Detection (2022), etc.) exemplified how ViTs were integrated into existing frameworks, combined with region-based methods, or extended with spatio-temporal attention for video analysis.\n    The 2023 foundational papers, while not introducing new task-specific methodologies, *implicitly* drive methodological progression in this trend. The availability of more robust, scalable, and general-purpose backbones (e.g., from **[ICLR2023] Scaling Vision Transformers to 1 Billion Parameters (2023)**, **[ICLR2023] DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision (2023)**, **[CVPR2023] InternImage: Exploring Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models with Deformable Convolutions (2023)**) simplifies the adaptation process for downstream tasks. Researchers can now leverage these powerful pre-trained models, focusing more on efficient fine-tuning strategies and task-specific decoder heads, rather than extensive backbone redesign.\n\n-   *Problem evolution*: Once ViTs proved capable for classification, the core problem shifted to adapting them for complex, fine-grained vision tasks demanding precise localization, pixel-level understanding, and spatio-temporal reasoning. Papers like **[ICLR2022] Vision Transformer for Dense Prediction (2022)** and **[CVPR2022] Max-DeepLab: End-to-End Transformer for Semantic Segmentation (2022)** addressed leveraging ViT's global context for pixel-level predictions. The ECCV 2022 papers tackled specific problems across detection, segmentation, pose estimation, and action recognition.\n    The new foundational models from 2023 address the meta-problem of *providing a universally strong and robust feature extractor* that can solve these diverse task-specific problems more effectively and with less task-specific data. This means the problems of localization, instance differentiation, and spatio-temporal reasoning can now be approached with significantly more powerful and generalizable visual representations, reducing the burden on task-specific adaptations.\n\n-   *Key innovations*: **[CVPR2022] Max-DeepLab: End-to-End Transformer for Semantic Segmentation (2022)** demonstrated end-to-end Transformer architectures for dense prediction. The ECCV 2022 papers represented key innovations in adapting ViTs for a vast array of tasks through novel decoder designs and query-based mechanisms.\n    The key innovation from the 2023 papers, in the context of this trend, is the *provision of superior, general-purpose visual features and backbones*. These foundation models (e.g., from **[ICLR2023] Scaling Vision Transformers to 1 Billion Parameters (2023)**, **[ICLR2023] DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision (2023)**) act as a powerful substrate, enabling existing task-specific innovations to achieve higher performance and greater robustness.\n\n-   *Integration points*: The foundational advancements in Trend 1 directly *empower* the continued success and expansion of Trend 2. The large-scale, robust features learned by models like those in **[ICLR2023] Scaling Vision Transformers to 1 Billion Parameters (2023)** and **[ICLR2023] DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision (2023)** become the new state-of-the-art backbones for tasks like object detection, segmentation, and pose estimation, enhancing the performance of the task-specific adaptations previously seen in 2022.\n\n---\n\n3. **Refined Synthesis:**\n\nThis expanded chain of works illustrates a profound intellectual trajectory, transforming the Transformer from an NLP-specific innovation into a versatile, general-purpose backbone for computer vision, now evolving into a paradigm for \"Vision Foundation Models.\" The collective contribution is the establishment of Vision Transformers and their hybrid descendants as a dominant force, capable of addressing an ever-widening spectrum of vision tasks by leveraging extreme scaling, advanced self-supervised learning, and synergistic architectural designs. My understanding of the field's evolution has been updated to emphasize a strategic shift towards creating universally powerful, pre-trained visual intelligence, rather than solely focusing on task-specific architectural tweaks, thereby accelerating progress across all downstream applications.",

        "title": "SpectFormer: Frequency and Attention is what you need in a Vision Transformer",
        "abstract": "Vision transformers have been applied successfully for image recognition tasks. There have been either multi-headed self-attention based (ViT [12], DelT [54]) simi-lar to the original work in textual models or more re-cently based on spectral layers (Fnet [29], GFNet [46], AFNO [15]). We hypothesize that spectral layers cap-ture high-frequency information such as lines and edges, while attention layers capture token interactions. We inves-tigate this hypothesis through this work and observe that indeed mixing spectral and multi-headed attention layers provides a better transformer architecture. We thus pro-pose the novel Spectformer architecture for vision trans-formers that has initial spectral and deeper multi-headed attention layers. We believe that the resulting representation allows the transformer to capture the feature repre-sentation appropriately and it yields improved performance over other transformer representations.

        "summary": "Vision transformers have been applied successfully for image recognition tasks. There have been either multi-headed self-attention based (ViT [12], DelT [54]) simi-lar to the original work in textual models or more re-cently based on spectral layers (Fnet [29], GFNet [46], AFNO [15]). We hypothesize that spectral layers cap-ture high-frequency information such as lines and edges, while attention layers capture token interactions. We inves-tigate this hypothesis through this work and observe that indeed mixing spectral and multi-headed attention layers provides a better transformer architecture. We thus pro-pose the novel Spectformer architecture for vision trans-formers that has initial spectral and deeper multi-headed attention layers. We believe that the resulting representation allows the transformer to capture the feature repre-sentation appropriately and it yields improved performance over other transformer representations.

However, the computation required for replacing word tokens with image patches for Transformer after the tokenization of the image is vast(e.g., ViT), which bottlenecks model training and inference. In this paper, we propose a new attention mechanism in Transformer termed Cross Attention, which alternates attention inner the image patch instead of the whole image to capture local information and apply attention between image patches which are divided from single-channel feature maps to capture global information. Both operations have less computation than standard self-attention in Transformer. Based on that, we build a hierarchical network called Cross Attention Transformer(CAT) for other vision tasks. Our model achieves 82.8% on ImageNet-1K, and improves the performance of other methods on COCO and ADE20K, illustrating that our network has the potential to serve as general backbones.

Therefore, inspired by the successful application of Transformer architecture in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, a novel Transformer method called LeViT was introduced for automatic asphalt pavement image classification. LeViT consists of convolutional layers, transformer stages where Multi-layer Perception (MLP) and multi-head self-attention blocks alternate using the residual connection, and two classifier heads. To conduct the proposed methods, three different sources of pavement image datasets and pre-trained weights based on ImageNet were attained. The performance of the proposed model was compared with six state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning models. All of them were trained based on transfer learning strategy. Compared to the tested SOTA methods, LeViT has less than 1/8 of the parameters of the original Vision Transformer (ViT) and 1/2 of ResNet and InceptionNet. Experimental results show that after training for 100 epochs with a 16 batch-size, the proposed method acquired 91.56% accuracy, 91.72% precision, 91.56% recall, and 91.45% F1-score in the Chinese asphalt pavement dataset and 99.17% accuracy, 99.19% precision, 99.17% recall, and 99.17% F1-score in the German asphalt pavement dataset, which is the best performance among all the tested SOTA models. Moreover, it shows superiority in inference speed (86 ms/step), which is approximately 25% of the original ViT method and 80% of some prevailing CNN-based models, including DenseNet, VGG, and ResNet. Overall, the proposed method can achieve competitive performance with fewer computation costs.

To solve the problem of the inconsistent performances of multiple heads, we propose the MHV module, which considers all of the heads in each layer as weak learners and votes for tokens of discriminative regions as cross-layer feature based on the attention maps and spatial relationships. To effectively mine the cross-layer feature and suppress the noise, the CLR module is proposed, where the refined feature is extracted and the assist logits operation is developed for the final prediction. In addition, a newly designed DS module adjusts the token selection number at each layer by weighting their contributions of the refined feature.

In particular, in running MAE on ImageNet-1K, HiViT-B reports a +0.6% accuracy gain over ViT-B and a 1.9$\\times$ speed-up over Swin-B, and the performance gain generalizes to downstream tasks of detection and segmentation.

        "abstract": "Multi-scale Vision Transformer (ViT) has emerged as a powerful backbone for computer vision tasks, while the self-attention computation in Transformer scales quadratically w.r.t. the input patch number. Thus, existing solutions commonly employ down-sampling operations (e.g., average pooling) over keys/values to dramatically reduce the computational cost. In this work, we argue that such over-aggressive down-sampling design is not invertible and inevitably causes information dropping especially for high-frequency components in objects (e.g., texture details). Motivated by the wavelet theory, we construct a new Wavelet Vision Transformer (\\textbf{Wave-ViT}) that formulates the invertible down-sampling with wavelet transforms and self-attention learning in a unified way. This proposal enables self-attention learning with lossless down-sampling over keys/values, facilitating the pursuing of a better efficiency-vs-accuracy trade-off. Furthermore, inverse wavelet transforms are leveraged to strengthen self-attention outputs by aggregating local contexts with enlarged receptive field. We validate the superiority of Wave-ViT through extensive experiments over multiple vision tasks (e.g., image recognition, object detection and instance segmentation).

    "layer2_summary": "\n\n2. *Evolution Analysis:*\n\nThe evolution of research from \"A survey on Visual Transformer\" can be broadly categorized into two major trends: first, the foundational adaptation and architectural refinement of Transformers for vision, and second, the subsequent diversification and specialization of these Vision Transformers across a comprehensive array of computer vision tasks.\n\n*Trend 1: From NLP Foundation to Vision Adaptation & Architectural Generalization*\n\n-   *Methodological progression*: The journey began with **[NIPS2017] Attention Is All You Need (2017)**, which introduced the Transformer, a novel architecture relying solely on self-attention, fundamentally shifting sequence modeling in NLP away from recurrent and convolutional networks. The pivotal methodological leap for vision came with **[ICLR2019] An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale (2021)**, which directly applied this NLP-centric Transformer to images by treating them as sequences of patches. This \"flat\" application, however, presented challenges, leading to the development of more sophisticated architectures. **[ICLR2021] Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows (2021)** introduced a hierarchical structure with shifted window attention, enabling linear computational complexity and better modeling of visual hierarchies. Concurrently, **[ICCV2021] Pyramid Vision Transformer: A Feature Pyramid Network for Vision Transformers (2021)** focused on generating multi-scale feature maps through a pyramid structure with spatial reduction attention. Further methodological refinements included **[CVPR2022] Focal Attention for Long-Range Dependencies in Vision Transformers (2022)**, which optimized attention mechanisms for a better balance between local and global context. A significant methodological shift for training came with **[CVPR2022] Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners (2022)**, introducing an efficient self-supervised pre-training paradigm.\n\n-   *Problem evolution*: Initially, the problem was to overcome the limitations of RNNs/CNNs in NLP for sequence modeling. This evolved into the fundamental challenge of applying Transformers to static images for classification, as addressed by **[ICLR2019] An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale (2021)**. The subsequent problems revolved around the ViT's high computational cost for high-resolution images, its quadratic complexity, and its lack of inherent multi-scale representation, which made it unsuitable for dense prediction tasks. **[ICLR2021] Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows (2021)** and **[ICCV2021] Pyramid Vision Transformer: A Feature Pyramid Network for Vision Transformers (2021)** directly tackled these issues. The data-hungry nature of early ViTs was a major bottleneck, which **[CVPR2022] Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners (2022)** addressed by proposing efficient self-supervised pre-training.\n\n-   *Key innovations*: The original Transformer from **[NIPS2017] Attention Is All You Need (2017)** was the foundational innovation. **[ICLR2019] An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale (2021)** pioneered the Vision Transformer (ViT) by patching images and directly applying the Transformer encoder. **[ICLR2021] Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows (2021)** introduced shifted window attention and hierarchical feature maps, making ViTs efficient and general-purpose backbones. **[ICCV2021] Pyramid Vision Transformer: A Feature Pyramid Network for Vision Transformers (2021)** provided a solution for multi-scale feature generation. **[CVPR2022] Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners (2022)** delivered a breakthrough in self-supervised pre-training, significantly reducing the reliance on massive labeled datasets.\n\n*Trend 2: Diversification and Specialization for Comprehensive Vision Understanding*\n\n-   *Methodological progression*: Building upon the generalized ViT backbones, this trend saw a rapid expansion into task-specific adaptations. **[ICLR2022] Vision Transformer for Dense Prediction (2022)** began to consolidate strategies for adapting ViTs to pixel-level tasks. This led to the development of end-to-end Transformer architectures for specific dense prediction tasks, such as **[CVPR2022] Max-DeepLab: End-to-End Transformer for Semantic Segmentation (2022)**. Methodologies evolved to include specialized decoder heads, query-based approaches, and spatio-temporal extensions. **[CVPR2022] Global Context Vision Transformers (2022)** focused on explicitly enhancing global context capture for various tasks. The cluster of ECCV 2022 papers ([ECCV2022] Vision Transformer for Object Detection (2022), [ECCV2022] Region-based Transformer for Object Detection (2022), [ECCV2022] Vision Transformer for Semantic Segmentation (2022), [ECCV2022] Vision Transformer for Instance Segmentation (2022), [ECCV2022] Vision Transformer for Panoptic Segmentation (2022), [ECCV2022] Vision Transformer for Pose Estimation (2022), [ECCV2022] Vision Transformer for Action Recognition (2022)) exemplifies this progression, showcasing how ViTs were integrated into existing frameworks, combined with region-based methods, or extended with spatio-temporal attention for video analysis.\n\n-   *Problem evolution*: Once ViTs proved their capability for image classification and general feature extraction, the core problem shifted to adapting them for more complex, fine-grained vision tasks. These tasks demand precise localization, pixel-level understanding, instance differentiation, and spatio-temporal reasoning. Papers like **[ICLR2022] Vision Transformer for Dense Prediction (2022)** and **[CVPR2022] Max-DeepLab: End-to-End Transformer for Semantic Segmentation (2022)** addressed the challenge of leveraging ViT's global context for pixel-level predictions. The subsequent ECCV 2022 papers tackled specific problems: accurately localizing and classifying objects ([ECCV2022] Vision Transformer for Object Detection (2022), [ECCV2022] Region-based Transformer for Object Detection (2022)), distinguishing individual instances ([ECCV2022] Vision Transformer for Instance Segmentation (2022)), unifying semantic and instance understanding ([ECCV2022] Vision Transformer for Panoptic Segmentation (2022)), inferring human body configurations ([ECCV2022] Vision Transformer for Pose Estimation (2022)), and understanding dynamic events in videos ([ECCV2022] Vision Transformer for Action Recognition (2022)).\n\n-   *Key innovations*: **[CVPR2022] Max-DeepLab: End-to-End Transformer for Semantic Segmentation (2022)** demonstrated the viability of end-to-end Transformer architectures for dense prediction. The collective contributions of the ECCV 2022 papers represent key innovations in adapting ViTs for a vast array of tasks, often through novel decoder designs, query-based mechanisms, and spatio-temporal attention. These innovations enabled ViTs to move beyond classification and become versatile tools for comprehensive scene understanding, from object detection and various forms of segmentation to human pose estimation and action recognition.\n\n3. *Synthesis*:\nThis chain of works illustrates a rapid and profound intellectual trajectory, transforming the Transformer from an NLP-specific innovation into a versatile, general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Their collective contribution is the establishment of Vision Transformers as a dominant paradigm, capable of addressing a wide spectrum of vision tasks, from foundational image understanding to complex spatio-temporal analysis, often outperforming traditional CNN-based approaches."

The large, sometimes even global, receptive field endows Transformer models with higher representation power over their CNN counterparts. Nevertheless, simply enlarging receptive field also gives rise to several concerns. On the one hand, using dense attention e.g., in ViT, leads to excessive memory and computational cost, and features can be influenced by irrelevant parts which are beyond the region of interests. On the other hand, the sparse attention adopted in PVT or Swin Transformer is data agnostic and may limit the ability to model long range relations. To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel deformable selfattention module, where the positions of key and value pairs in selfattention are selected in a data-dependent way. This flexible scheme enables the self-attention module to focus on relevant re-gions and capture more informative features.

        "abstract": "Self-attention mechanism has been a key factor in the recent progress of Vision Transformer (ViT), which enables adaptive feature extraction from global contexts. However, existing self-attention methods either adopt sparse global attention or window attention to reduce the computation complexity, which may compromise the local feature learning or subject to some handcrafted designs. In contrast, local attention, which restricts the receptive field of each query to its own neighboring pixels, enjoys the benefits of both convolution and self-attention, namely local inductive bias and dynamic feature selection. Nevertheless, current local attention modules either use inefficient Im2Col function or rely on specific CUDA kernels that are hard to generalize to devices without CUDA support. In this paper, we propose a novel local attention module, Slide Attention, which leverages common convolution operations to achieve high efficiency, flexibility and generalizability. Specifically, we first re-interpret the column-based Im2Col function from a new row-based perspective and use Depthwise Convolution as an efficient substitution. On this basis, we propose a deformed shifting module based on the re-parameterization technique, which further relaxes the fixed key/value positions to deformed features in the local region. In this way, our module realizes the local attention paradigm in both efficient and flexible manner. Extensive experiments show that our slide attention module is applicable to a variety of advanced Vision Transformer models and compatible with various hardware devices, and achieves consistently improved performances on comprehensive benchmarks.",

Our framework, vision transformer (ViT)-MVT, built on a plain and nonhierarchical ViT, incorporates numerous visual tasks into a modest supernet and optimizes them jointly across various dataset domains. For the design of ViT-MVT, we augment the ViT with a multihead self-attention (MHSE) to offer complementary cues in the channel and spatial dimension, as well as a local perception unit (LPU) and locality feed-forward network (locality FFN) for information exchange in the local region, thus endowing ViT-MVT with the ability to effectively optimize multiple tasks. Besides, we construct a search space comprising potential architectures with a broad spectrum of model sizes to offer various optimum candidates for diverse tasks.

Extensive experiments reveal that ViT-MVT delivers exceptional performances for multiple visual tasks over state-of-the-art methods while necessitating considerably fewer total storage costs.

We inves-tigate this hypothesis through this work and observe that indeed mixing spectral and multi-headed attention layers provides a better transformer architecture. We thus pro-pose the novel Spectformer architecture for vision trans-formers that has initial spectral and deeper multi-headed attention layers. We believe that the resulting representation allows the transformer to capture the feature repre-sentation appropriately and it yields improved performance over other transformer representations.

Further, Spectformer-H-L achieves 85.7% which is the state of the art for the comparable base version of the transformers.

To address this issue, window-based self-attention ViT limits attention area to a specific window, thereby mitigating the computational complexity. However, it cannot effectively capture the relationships between windows. The Swin Transformer, a representative window-based self-attention ViT, introduces shifted-window multi-head self-attention (SW-MSA) to capture the cross-window information. However, SW-MSA groups tokens that are close to each other in the image into one window and thus cannot capture relationships between distant tokens. Therefore, this paper introduces a feature-space window attention transformer (FSwin Transformer) that includes distant but similar tokens in one window. The proposed FSwin Transformer clusters similar tokens based on the feature space and conducts self-attention within the cluster. Thus, this approach helps understand the global context of the image by compensating for interactions between long-distance tokens, which cannot be captured when windows are set based on the image space. In addition, we incorporate a feature-space refinement method with channel and spatial attention to emphasize key parts and suppress non-essential parts. The refined feature map improves the representation power of the model, resulting in improved classification performance.
