2. *Evolution Analysis:*

The evolution of Vision Transformers (ViTs) can be traced through two major trends: first, the foundational adaptation of the Transformer from NLP to vision, and second, the subsequent refinement and expansion of ViT capabilities to address its initial limitations and broaden its applicability across diverse vision tasks.

*Trend 1: From NLP Foundation to Vision Dominance*
- *Methodological progression*: The journey begins with **[Vaswani2017] Attention Is All You Need (2017)**, which introduced the Transformer architecture and the self-attention mechanism, revolutionizing sequence modeling in NLP. This foundational work established a powerful, parallelizable architecture capable of capturing long-range dependencies. The critical methodological leap for vision occurred with **[Dosovitskiy2021] An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale (2021)**. This paper directly adapted the Transformer by treating image patches as sequence tokens, applying the NLP-centric model to 2D visual data.
- *Problem evolution*: **[Vaswani2017]** addressed the limitations of recurrent networks in handling long sequences and their sequential processing bottleneck. The challenge then became how to apply this powerful architecture to image data, traditionally dominated by CNNs. **[Dosovitskiy2021]** tackled this by formulating image recognition as a sequence-to-sequence problem, effectively challenging the long-held paradigm of convolutional feature extraction in computer vision.
- *Key innovations*: The self-attention mechanism and the original Transformer architecture from **[Vaswani2017]** were the bedrock. **[Dosovitskiy2021]**'s key innovation was the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture itself, demonstrating that a pure Transformer could achieve state-of-the-art performance in image classification when trained on massive datasets, by using patch embeddings and positional embeddings for images.

*Trend 2: Addressing ViT's Limitations & Expanding Capabilities*
- *Methodological progression*: Following the initial success of ViT, subsequent research rapidly focused on improving its practical viability and versatility. **[Touvron2021] Training data-efficient image transformers & distillation through attention (2021)** introduced knowledge distillation to make ViTs less data-hungry. To overcome ViT's quadratic complexity and lack of hierarchical features, **[Liu2021] Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows (2021)** developed a hierarchical architecture with local, shifted window attention. Similarly, **[Wang2021] Pyramid Vision Transformer: A Versatile Backbone for Dense Prediction without Convolutions (2021)** proposed a pure Transformer-based pyramid structure for multi-scale feature generation. **[Yuan2021] Tokens-to-Token ViT: Training Vision Transformers from Scratch on ImageNet (2021)** refined the initial tokenization process to improve performance on smaller datasets. This rapid development led to a need for synthesis, resulting in surveys like **[Chen2021] When Vision Transformers Meet MEC: A Survey (2021)**, **[Han2022] A Survey of Vision Transformers (2022)**, and **[Khan2022] Transformers in Vision: A Survey (2022)**, which categorize and analyze the burgeoning field.
- *Problem evolution*: The initial ViT faced several critical limitations: its requirement for massive datasets (addressed by **[Touvron2021]** and **[Yuan2021]**), its quadratic computational complexity for high-resolution images, and its inability to generate multi-scale feature maps essential for dense prediction tasks (addressed by **[Liu2021]** and **[Wang2021]**). As ViTs matured, the problem shifted to practical deployment in resource-constrained environments, which **[Chen2021]** began to survey. The sheer volume of new architectures and applications also created a need for comprehensive overviews, leading to the broader surveys by **[Han2022]** and **[Khan2022]**.
- *Key innovations*: **[Touvron2021]**'s DeiT enabled data-efficient training. **[Liu2021]**'s Swin Transformer introduced hierarchical feature maps and shifted window attention, making ViTs suitable for dense prediction. **[Wang2021]**'s PVT offered an alternative pure Transformer backbone for multi-scale feature extraction. **[Yuan2021]**'s T2T module improved initial token representation, boosting performance on standard datasets. The surveys by **[Chen2021]**, **[Han2022]**, and **[Khan2022]** represent a meta-innovation: the systematic organization and analysis of a rapidly evolving field, identifying trends, challenges, and future directions.

3. *Synthesis*:
These works collectively trace the journey of the Transformer from an NLP innovation to a dominant paradigm in computer vision, systematically addressing its initial limitations to enhance efficiency, versatility, and practical applicability. Their unified intellectual trajectory is the continuous adaptation and optimization of the self-attention mechanism for visual tasks, culminating in a robust and diverse ecosystem of Vision Transformer architectures. Their collective contribution to advancing "A survey on Visual Transformer" is to provide the foundational models, key architectural improvements, and comprehensive syntheses that define the field's landscape and future research directions.

2. *Evolution Analysis:*

The evolution of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using radar data, as contextualized by "[huan202345b] A lightweight hybrid vision transformer network for radar-based human activity recognition (2023)", reveals two major trends: first, a fundamental shift from traditional, feature-engineered methods to sophisticated deep learning architectures, culminating in Vision Transformers; and second, a subsequent drive to optimize these powerful models for efficiency and deployment in resource-constrained environments.

*Trend 1: The Shift from Feature Engineering to Deep Learning and Global Context for HAR*
- *Methodological progression*: Early approaches to radar-based HAR relied on *traditional classification techniques* such as Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). These methods necessitated *manually extracted micro-Doppler features* from radar signals. This represented a foundational stage where human expertise was crucial for feature engineering. The field then progressed significantly with the advent of *deep learning (DL) techniques*, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). These models marked a major methodological shift by automatically extracting features from raw or minimally processed radar data (like micro-Doppler maps), thereby overcoming the limitations imposed by prior knowledge and task intricacy inherent in traditional methods. The most recent significant progression in this trend is the adoption of *Transformers*, specifically *Vision Transformers (ViT)*, which leverage self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies across the entire micro-Doppler map, offering a more holistic understanding of activity patterns.
- *Problem evolution*: Traditional methods were limited by their reliance on expert-defined features and struggled with the increasing intricacy of HAR tasks. While deep learning methods like CNNs and RNNs addressed the problem of automatic feature extraction, they often introduced new challenges related to computational burden or, in the case of lightweight CNNs, a decline in recognition accuracy due to missed details. The introduction of *conventional ViT* aimed to solve the problem of capturing global features for higher accuracy but, in turn, presented a significant challenge: a large number of parameters and high computational cost, making them impractical for embedded applications.
- *Key innovations*: The key innovations in this trend include the development of algorithms for *automatic feature learning* (CNNs, RNNs) and the application of *global self-attention mechanisms* (ViT) to image-like data, enabling models to learn more complex and context-rich representations of human activities.

*Trend 2: Optimizing Vision Transformers for Resource-Constrained HAR*
- *Methodological progression*: Following the establishment of ViT as a powerful, albeit computationally intensive, architecture, the research trajectory shifted towards optimizing these models for practical deployment. This involved moving beyond *conventional ViT* and *lightweight CNNs* (which often compromised accuracy) towards hybrid and highly efficient architectures. The paper "[huan202345b] A lightweight hybrid vision transformer network for radar-based human activity recognition (2023)" exemplifies this trend by proposing a *Lightweight Hybrid Vision Transformer (LH-ViT)*. This architecture represents a sophisticated methodological integration, combining efficient convolution operations with a significantly optimized self-attention mechanism.
- *Problem evolution*: The primary problem addressed by this trend is the critical trade-off between achieving high HAR accuracy and ensuring the network is lightweight and has low latency, especially for embedded applications. Conventional ViT models, while accurate, were computationally burdensome. Existing lightweight solutions, often based on CNNs, frequently compromised recognition accuracy by missing fine-grained details. [huan202345b] directly tackles this by aiming for both high accuracy and reduced computational load.
- *Key innovations*: The LH-ViT introduces several breakthrough contributions. It employs a *Feature Pyramid architecture* for multi-scale feature extraction, enhancing representational power. A novel *efficient RES-SE block* replaces traditional convolutions, utilizing depthwise separable convolutions within a residual learning framework and incorporating a lightweight Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) network for adaptive channel weight adjustment, significantly reducing computational overhead. Crucially, the paper introduces *Radar-ViT*, a lightweight design of ViT that simplifies the class token module to a point-wise convolution and uses *fold and unfold operations* to drastically reduce the computational demands of the multi-head attention block, enabling efficient capture of global micro-Doppler features. These innovations collectively allow for efficient HAR at different Doppler scales while significantly reducing parameter count compared to conventional ViT.

3. *Synthesis*
The intellectual trajectory connecting these conceptual stages, culminating in "[huan202345b] A lightweight hybrid vision transformer network for radar-based human activity recognition (2023)", is a continuous pursuit of more accurate, robust, and increasingly efficient methods for radar-based HAR. Their collective contribution to advancing "A survey on Visual Transformer" lies in demonstrating how to effectively adapt and optimize the powerful global feature learning capabilities of Vision Transformers for resource-constrained embedded systems, particularly by integrating them with efficient convolutional structures to balance accuracy and computational cost.

1.  **Chronological Progression Analysis:**

    *   **[huan202345b] A lightweight hybrid vision transformer network for radar-based human activity recognition (2023)**
        *   **Methodological/Conceptual Shift:** This paper introduces a significant methodological shift towards **hybrid, lightweight Vision Transformer architectures** tailored for resource-constrained environments. It moves beyond the limitations of large, computationally intensive pure ViT models and the accuracy compromises of purely lightweight CNNs. The core conceptual shift is the intelligent integration of efficient convolutional operations (for local feature extraction and efficiency) with a highly optimized self-attention mechanism (for global feature capture).
        *   **Problems Addressed:**
            *   **Computational Burden of Standard ViTs:** Addresses the challenge that traditional Vision Transformers (ViT), while accurate, possess a large number of parameters, making them impractical for deployment in embedded systems for radar-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR).

2.  *Evolution Analysis:*

    *Trend 1: Optimizing Vision Transformers for Resource-Constrained Human Activity Recognition*

    *   *Methodological progression*: The evolution in this context, as represented by "[huan202345b] A lightweight hybrid vision transformer network for radar-based human activity recognition (2023)", marks a significant methodological progression from earlier, more generalized deep learning approaches for Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Previously, methods included traditional classification techniques (e.g., MLP, PCA, SVM) and deep learning models like CNNs, RNNs, and early Vision Transformers (ViT). While CNNs offered some efficiency and RNNs handled sequential data, ViTs, known for their global feature capture via self-attention, often came with a prohibitive number of parameters. Lightweight CNNs attempted to address efficiency but frequently compromised accuracy. The paper by [huan202345b] introduces a **hybrid methodology** that strategically combines the strengths of both convolutional networks (for local feature extraction and efficiency) and Vision Transformers (for global context) into a highly optimized architecture. This is exemplified by the integration of efficient RES-SE blocks for local processing and the novel Radar-ViT module for global attention, moving beyond the limitations of purely monolithic or overly simplified architectures.

    *   *Problem evolution*: The problem landscape for HAR has evolved from simply achieving high accuracy to demanding high accuracy *under severe computational constraints*. Earlier works focused on improving recognition rates, often at the expense of model complexity. As applications shifted towards embedded systems in intelligent healthcare and smart homes, the critical problem became the trade-off between accuracy and computational lightweightness and low latency. [huan202345b] directly addresses this evolved problem. It tackles the specific technical challenge of making powerful ViT-like architectures viable for radar-based HAR in embedded environments, where large parameter counts of conventional ViTs are unfeasible, and the accuracy drop of existing lightweight CNNs is unacceptable. The paper explicitly aims to bridge this gap, ensuring both high recognition performance and operational efficiency.

    *   *Key innovations*: The paper introduces several key innovations that enable this progression. The **Lightweight Hybrid Vision Transformer (LH-ViT)** architecture itself is a breakthrough, integrating a Feature Pyramid for multi-scale feature extraction with stacked Radar-ViT modules. A crucial innovation is the **Radar-ViT module**, which re-engineers the self-attention mechanism by using fold and unfold operations to drastically reduce its computational load, making global feature capture efficient enough for embedded systems. Furthermore, the **efficient RES-SE block** replaces traditional convolutions with depthwise separable convolutions and a lightweight Squeeze-and-Excitation module, significantly cutting down parameter count and computational overhead without sacrificing representational power. These innovations collectively enable the deployment of sophisticated, high-accuracy HAR models in resource-constrained settings, a capability previously challenging to achieve.

3.  *Synthesis*

    This work, "[huan202345b] A lightweight hybrid vision transformer network for radar-based human activity recognition (2023)", represents a crucial step in adapting powerful Vision Transformer concepts for practical, resource-constrained applications. Its collective contribution to advancing "A survey on Visual Transformer" lies in demonstrating how to meticulously optimize and hybridize ViT architectures to overcome their inherent computational demands, thereby extending their applicability to real-world embedded systems requiring both high accuracy and efficiency in domains like radar-based human activity recognition.

Seed: DeepViT: Towards Deeper Vision Transformer
Development direction taxonomy summary:
1. **Integration Analysis:**

The newly introduced papers significantly extend and refine the previously identified evolutionary trends, particularly strengthening the first trend concerning foundational adaptation, architectural generalization, and pre-training paradigms. They introduce several new methodological and conceptual shifts, pushing the boundaries of Vision Transformers (ViTs) towards "Foundation Models" and hybrid architectures.

-   **Relation to Previous Trends:**
    *   **Trend 1 (From NLP Foundation to Vision Adaptation & Architectural Generalization):** All new papers directly contribute to and substantially advance this trend. They focus on scaling ViTs to unprecedented sizes (`[ICLR2023] Scaling Vision Transformers to 1 Billion Parameters (2023)`), enhancing self-supervised learning for robust feature extraction (`[ICLR2023] DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision (2023)`), developing hybrid architectures that combine CNN and Transformer strengths (`[ICLR2023] ConvNeXt V2: Co-designing and Scaling ConvNets with Masked Autoencoders (2023)`, `[CVPR2023] InternImage: Exploring Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models with Deformable Convolutions (2023)`), and improving efficiency for practical deployment (`[ICCV2023] MobileViT V2: Local-Global-Feature Interaction for Efficient and Large-Scale Vision Transformers (2023)`). These contributions deepen the understanding of how to build powerful, general-purpose visual backbones.
    *   **Trend 2 (Diversification and Specialization for Comprehensive Vision Understanding):** While none of the new papers directly introduce novel task-specific ViT architectures for dense prediction or other specialized tasks, their foundational improvements (larger models, better pre-training, more robust features, efficient designs) *implicitly* and *significantly* enhance the performance and applicability of ViTs across *all* downstream tasks outlined in Trend 2. They provide stronger, more versatile backbones for future specialization.

-   **New Methodological or Conceptual Shifts:**
    *   **Vision Foundation Models:** A major conceptual shift is the emergence of "Vision Foundation Models," exemplified by `[ICLR2023] Scaling Vision Transformers to 1 Billion Parameters (2023)` and `[CVPR2023] InternImage: Exploring Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models with Deformable Convolutions (2023)`. This moves beyond individual architectural improvements to creating massive, general-purpose models pre-trained on vast datasets, intended to serve as versatile backbones for a wide array of tasks with minimal fine-tuning.
    *   **Advanced Self-Supervised Learning for Robustness:** `[ICLR2023] DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision (2023)` pushes self-supervised learning beyond just pre-training efficiency (as with MAE) to explicitly learning highly robust and generalizable visual features, reducing the need for labeled data even further and improving transferability.
    *   **Hybrid Architectures and CNN-Transformer Convergence:** `[ICLR2023] ConvNeXt V2: Co-designing and Scaling ConvNets with Masked Autoencoders (2023)` and `[CVPR2023] InternImage: Exploring Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models with Deformable Convolutions (2023)` highlight a strong trend of integrating the inductive biases and strengths of CNNs (e.g., locality, deformable convolutions) with the global context modeling and scalability of Transformers, often leveraging Transformer-inspired pre-training techniques like Masked Autoencoders. This signifies a move away from a "Transformer vs. CNN" dichotomy towards synergistic designs.
    *   **Efficiency for Real-World Deployment:** `[ICCV2023] MobileViT V2: Local-Global-Feature Interaction for Efficient and Large-Scale Vision Transformers (2023)` emphasizes the growing importance of designing efficient ViT variants suitable for mobile and edge devices, balancing performance with computational constraints.

-   **Gaps Filled or New Directions Opened:**
    *   The previous synthesis highlighted the data-hungry nature of early ViTs and `[CVPR2022] Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners (2022)` as a solution. The new papers `[ICLR2023] Scaling Vision Transformers to 1 Billion Parameters (2023)` and `[ICLR2023] DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision (2023)` *deepen* this solution by demonstrating the power of scaling and advanced self-supervised learning to create even more robust and data-efficient models.
    *   The concept of "Vision Foundation Models" is a new, overarching direction that aims to create universal visual intelligence, moving beyond task-specific model development.
    *   The hybrid architecture trend opens new avenues for optimal model design, suggesting that the best solutions might lie in combining the strengths of different paradigms.

-   **Connections between New Papers and Earlier Works:**
    *   `[ICLR2023] Scaling Vision Transformers to 1 Billion Parameters (2023)` directly builds upon the original ViT `[ICLR2019] An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale (2021)` and the self-supervised pre-training paradigm of MAE `[CVPR2022] Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners (2022)`.
    *   `[ICLR2023] ConvNeXt V2: Co-designing and Scaling ConvNets with Masked Autoencoders (2023)` explicitly leverages the MAE pre-training strategy `[CVPR2022] Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners (2022)` to enhance CNNs, demonstrating cross-paradigm influence.
    *   `[ICLR2023] DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision (2023)` extends the self-supervised learning trajectory, building on prior works like DINO and implicitly addressing the data efficiency problem tackled by MAE.
    *   `[CVPR2023] InternImage: Exploring Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models with Deformable Convolutions (2023)` combines the architectural principles of ViTs with CNN elements (deformable convolutions), showing a synthesis of ideas from both domains.
    *   `[ICCV2023] MobileViT V2: Local-Global-Feature Interaction for Efficient and Large-Scale Vision Transformers (2023)` continues the line of architectural refinements seen in papers like `[ICLR2021] Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows (2021)` but with a specific focus on efficiency for mobile deployment.

-   **Change in Overall Narrative:**
    The overall narrative shifts from establishing ViTs as a viable alternative to CNNs and then adapting them to various tasks, to a more ambitious goal of creating *universal, robust, and efficient visual intelligence*. The focus is now on *how to scale and pre-train models effectively* (often with self-supervision and hybrid designs) to create powerful "foundation models" that can generalize across an extremely broad range of vision tasks, rather than just optimizing for individual tasks. The "Transformer vs. CNN" debate has largely evolved into a "Transformer *and* CNN" synergy.

**Temporal Positioning:**
All new papers are from 2023, positioning them as the latest developments in the field, following the 2021-2022 papers in the previous synthesis. They represent the current cutting edge of research in Vision Transformers and related architectures.

---

2. **Updated Evolution Analysis:**

The evolution of research from "A survey on Visual Transformer" continues to demonstrate a rapid and profound intellectual trajectory, now extending beyond the initial adaptation and diversification to focus on the creation of highly scalable, robust, and universally applicable "Vision Foundation Models." This progression can be understood through two evolving trends: first, the foundational adaptation, architectural refinement, and scaling of Transformers for vision, now encompassing hybrid designs and advanced self-supervised learning; and second, the continued diversification and specialization, now significantly empowered by these more powerful foundational models.

*Trend 1: From NLP Foundation to Vision Adaptation, Architectural Generalization, and Foundation Models*

-   *Methodological progression*: The journey began with **[NIPS2017] Attention Is All You Need (2017)**, establishing the Transformer. This was directly applied to images by **[ICLR2019] An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale (2021)**, treating images as sequences of patches. Subsequent architectural refinements, such as **[ICLR2021] Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows (2021)** and **[ICCV2021] Pyramid Vision Transformer: A Feature Pyramid Network for Vision Transformers (2021)**, introduced hierarchical structures and multi-scale feature generation to address computational complexity and better model visual hierarchies. **[CVPR2022] Focal Attention for Long-Range Dependencies in Vision Transformers (2022)** further optimized attention. A pivotal methodological shift for training came with **[CVPR2022] Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners (2022)**, introducing efficient self-supervised pre-training.
    This trend is significantly extended by the 2023 papers. **[ICLR2023] Scaling Vision Transformers to 1 Billion Parameters (2023)** pushes the architectural scale of ViTs to unprecedented levels, demonstrating the efficacy of massive models when combined with advanced pre-training. Concurrently, **[ICLR2023] DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision (2023)** refines self-supervised learning methodologies, moving beyond just efficiency to explicitly learn highly robust and generalizable visual features without supervision. A notable methodological shift is the emergence of hybrid architectures: **[ICLR2023] ConvNeXt V2: Co-designing and Scaling ConvNets with Masked Autoencoders (2023)** demonstrates how CNNs can be significantly enhanced by adopting Transformer-inspired self-supervised pre-training (MAE), while **[CVPR2023] InternImage: Exploring Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models with Deformable Convolutions (2023)** integrates deformable convolutions (a CNN strength) into large-scale Transformer-like architectures, aiming for universal foundation models. Furthermore, **[ICCV2023] MobileViT V2: Local-Global-Feature Interaction for Efficient and Large-Scale Vision Transformers (2023)** focuses on architectural designs for efficiency, enabling practical deployment on resource-constrained devices.

-   *Problem evolution*: Initially, the problem was applying Transformers to images for classification, as by **[ICLR2019] An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale (2021)**. This evolved into addressing ViT's high computational cost, quadratic complexity, and lack of inherent multi-scale representation, tackled by **[ICLR2021] Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows (2021)** and **[ICCV2021] Pyramid Vision Transformer: A Feature Pyramid Network for Vision Transformers (2021)**. The data-hungry nature of early ViTs was a major bottleneck, which **[CVPR2022] Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners (2022)** addressed.
    The new papers tackle the problem of achieving *universal applicability, extreme robustness, and efficiency at scale*. **[ICLR2023] Scaling Vision Transformers to 1 Billion Parameters (2023)** addresses the challenge of scaling models to unprecedented sizes for broader generalization. **[ICLR2023] DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision (2023)** solves the problem of learning highly transferable features that are robust across diverse downstream tasks without relying on extensive labeled data. The hybrid approaches in **[ICLR2023] ConvNeXt V2: Co-designing and Scaling ConvNets with Masked Autoencoders (2023)** and **[CVPR2023] InternImage: Exploring Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models with Deformable Convolutions (2023)** address the problem of combining the best inductive biases of CNNs with the global modeling capabilities and scalability of Transformers to create more powerful and versatile backbones. **[ICCV2023] MobileViT V2: Local-Global-Feature Interaction for Efficient and Large-Scale Vision Transformers (2023)** specifically targets the problem of deploying these powerful models efficiently on mobile and edge devices.

-   *Key innovations*: The original Transformer from **[NIPS2017] Attention Is All You Need (2017)** and the pioneering ViT by **[ICLR2019] An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale (2021)** were foundational. **[ICLR2021] Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows (2021)** introduced shifted window attention, and **[CVPR2022] Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners (2022)** delivered a breakthrough in self-supervised pre-training.
    The 2023 papers introduce several key innovations: **[ICLR2023] Scaling Vision Transformers to 1 Billion Parameters (2023)** demonstrates the viability and benefits of billion-parameter ViTs. **[ICLR2023] DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision (2023)** provides a new benchmark for learning robust, general-purpose visual features without supervision. **[ICLR2023] ConvNeXt V2: Co-designing and Scaling ConvNets with Masked Autoencoders (2023)** innovates by showing the power of MAE pre-training for CNNs, bridging the gap between the two architectures. **[CVPR2023] InternImage: Exploring Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models with Deformable Convolutions (2023)** introduces a novel hybrid architecture for large-scale foundation models, combining deformable convolutions with Transformer principles. **[ICCV2023] MobileViT V2: Local-Global-Feature Interaction for Efficient and Large-Scale Vision Transformers (2023)** offers an efficient architectural design for mobile deployment, balancing global and local feature interaction.

-   *Integration points*: The 2023 works directly build upon the self-supervised pre-training paradigm established by **[CVPR2022] Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners (2022)**, scaling it up and refining it for greater robustness and generalization. They also extend the architectural innovations of earlier ViTs (e.g., **[ICLR2019] An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale (2021)**, **[ICLR2021] Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows (2021)**) by exploring extreme scaling, hybrid designs, and efficiency-focused modifications.

*Trend 2: Diversification and Specialization for Comprehensive Vision Understanding (Empowered by Foundation Models)*

-   *Methodological progression*: Building upon the generalized ViT backbones, this trend saw rapid expansion into task-specific adaptations. **[ICLR2022] Vision Transformer for Dense Prediction (2022)** began to consolidate strategies for adapting ViTs to pixel-level tasks, leading to end-to-end architectures like **[CVPR2022] Max-DeepLab: End-to-End Transformer for Semantic Segmentation (2022)**. The cluster of ECCV 2022 papers ([ECCV2022] Vision Transformer for Object Detection (2022), etc.) exemplified how ViTs were integrated into existing frameworks, combined with region-based methods, or extended with spatio-temporal attention for video analysis.
    The 2023 foundational papers, while not introducing new task-specific methodologies, *implicitly* drive methodological progression in this trend. The availability of more robust, scalable, and general-purpose backbones (e.g., from **[ICLR2023] Scaling Vision Transformers to 1 Billion Parameters (2023)**, **[ICLR2023] DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision (2023)**, **[CVPR2023] InternImage: Exploring Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models with Deformable Convolutions (2023)**) simplifies the adaptation process for downstream tasks. Researchers can now leverage these powerful pre-trained models, focusing more on efficient fine-tuning strategies and task-specific decoder heads, rather than extensive backbone redesign.

-   *Problem evolution*: Once ViTs proved capable for classification, the core problem shifted to adapting them for complex, fine-grained vision tasks demanding precise localization, pixel-level understanding, and spatio-temporal reasoning. Papers like **[ICLR2022] Vision Transformer for Dense Prediction (2022)** and **[CVPR2022] Max-DeepLab: End-to-End Transformer for Semantic Segmentation (2022)** addressed leveraging ViT's global context for pixel-level predictions. The ECCV 2022 papers tackled specific problems across detection, segmentation, pose estimation, and action recognition.
    The new foundational models from 2023 address the meta-problem of *providing a universally strong and robust feature extractor* that can solve these diverse task-specific problems more effectively and with less task-specific data. This means the problems of localization, instance differentiation, and spatio-temporal reasoning can now be approached with significantly more powerful and generalizable visual representations, reducing the burden on task-specific adaptations.

-   *Key innovations*: **[CVPR2022] Max-DeepLab: End-to-End Transformer for Semantic Segmentation (2022)** demonstrated end-to-end Transformer architectures for dense prediction. The ECCV 2022 papers represented key innovations in adapting ViTs for a vast array of tasks through novel decoder designs and query-based mechanisms.
    The key innovation from the 2023 papers, in the context of this trend, is the *provision of superior, general-purpose visual features and backbones*. These foundation models (e.g., from **[ICLR2023] Scaling Vision Transformers to 1 Billion Parameters (2023)**, **[ICLR2023] DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision (2023)**) act as a powerful substrate, enabling existing task-specific innovations to achieve higher performance and greater robustness.

-   *Integration points*: The foundational advancements in Trend 1 directly *empower* the continued success and expansion of Trend 2. The large-scale, robust features learned by models like those in **[ICLR2023] Scaling Vision Transformers to 1 Billion Parameters (2023)** and **[ICLR2023] DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision (2023)** become the new state-of-the-art backbones for tasks like object detection, segmentation, and pose estimation, enhancing the performance of the task-specific adaptations previously seen in 2022.
