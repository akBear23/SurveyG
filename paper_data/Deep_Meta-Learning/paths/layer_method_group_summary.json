    "summary": "1.  <think>\nThe papers naturally divide into two main categories based on the type of learning problem they address: supervised few-shot learning (primarily classification) and meta-learning for sequential decision-making (reinforcement learning and imitation learning).\n\n**Subgroup 1: Supervised Few-Shot Learning: Metric and Optimization Approaches**\n*   **[sung2017nc5] Learning to Compare: Relation Network for Few-Shot Learning (2017)**: Focuses on few-shot image classification. Its core methodology is learning a *non-linear metric* (relation function) to compare embeddings. This is a supervised learning task.\n*   **[bertinetto2018ur2] Meta-learning with differentiable closed-form solvers (2018)**: Also targets few-shot classification. Its methodology involves meta-learning *differentiable closed-form solvers* as the base learner, which is an optimization-based approach for supervised learning.\n\nBoth papers deal with static datasets and the problem of classifying new categories with very few examples, using different meta-learning strategies (metric learning vs. learning an optimizer/base learner).\n\n**Subgroup 2: Meta-Learning for Sequential Decision Making (Reinforcement & Imitation Learning)**\n*   **[wang20167px] Learning to reinforcement learn (2016)**: This is explicitly about meta-reinforcement learning. It uses RNNs to implicitly learn an RL algorithm. This is about learning policies in dynamic environments.\n*   **[finn20174c4] One-Shot Visual Imitation Learning via Meta-Learning (2017)**: Applies meta-learning (specifically MAML) to visual imitation learning for robotics. Imitation learning is a form of learning policies for sequential tasks, often bridging supervised learning and RL.\n*   **[rakelly2019m09] Efficient Off-Policy Meta-Reinforcement Learning via Probabilistic Context Variables (2019)**: Directly addresses meta-reinforcement learning, focusing on sample efficiency and off-policy learning. This is clearly about learning policies in dynamic environments.\n\nAll three papers in the second subgroup deal with learning *behaviors* or *policies* in environments where agents interact sequentially, receive feedback (rewards or demonstrations), and need to adapt. This is a distinct problem space from static classification.\n\nThis two-subgroup structure provides a clear and logical division based on the fundamental nature of the tasks (classification vs. control/decision-making) and the corresponding methodological challenges.",
