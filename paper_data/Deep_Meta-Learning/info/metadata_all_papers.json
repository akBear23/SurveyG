Our method, called the Relation Network (RN), is trained end-to-end from scratch. During meta-learning, it learns to learn a deep distance metric to compare a small number of images within episodes, each of which is designed to simulate the few-shot setting. Once trained, a RN is able to classify images of new classes by computing relation scores between query images and the few examples of each new class without further updating the network. Besides providing improved performance on few-shot learning, our framework is easily extended to zero-shot learning. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that our simple approach provides a unified and effective approach for both of these two tasks.",

Contrary to conventional approaches to AI where tasks are solved from scratch using a fixed learning algorithm, meta-learning aims to improve the learning algorithm itself, given the experience of multiple learning episodes. This paradigm provides an opportunity to tackle many conventional challenges of deep learning, including data and computation bottlenecks, as well as generalization. This survey describes the contemporary meta-learning landscape. We first discuss definitions of meta-learning and position it with respect to related fields, such as transfer learning and hyperparameter optimization. We then propose a new taxonomy that provides a more comprehensive breakdown of the space of meta-learning methods today. We survey promising applications and successes of meta-learning such as few-shot learning and reinforcement learning.

The key idea is to leverage a large number of similar few-shot tasks in order to learn how to adapt a base-learner to a new task for which only a few labeled samples are available. As deep neural networks (DNNs) tend to overfit using a few samples only, meta-learning typically uses shallow neural networks (SNNs), thus limiting its effectiveness. In this paper we propose a novel few-shot learning method called meta-transfer learning (MTL) which learns to adapt a deep NN for few shot learning tasks. Specifically, \"meta\" refers to training multiple tasks, and \"transfer\" is achieved by learning scaling and shifting functions of DNN weights for each task. In addition, we introduce the hard task (HT) meta-batch scheme as an effective learning curriculum for MTL. We conduct experiments using (5-class, 1-shot) and (5-class, 5-shot) recognition tasks on two challenging few-shot learning benchmarks: miniImageNet and Fewshot-CIFAR100. Extensive comparisons to related works validate that our meta-transfer learning approach trained with the proposed HT meta-batch scheme achieves top performance. An ablation study also shows that both components contribute to fast convergence and high accuracy.",

Most work on few-shot learning has thus focused on simple learning techniques for adaptation, such as nearest neighbours or gradient descent. Nonetheless, the machine learning literature contains a wealth of methods that learn non-deep models very efficiently. In this paper, we propose to use these fast convergent methods as the main adaptation mechanism for few-shot learning. The main idea is to teach a deep network to use standard machine learning tools, such as ridge regression, as part of its own internal model, enabling it to quickly adapt to novel data. This requires back-propagating errors through the solver steps. While normally the cost of the matrix operations involved in such a process would be significant, by using the Woodbury identity we can make the small number of examples work to our advantage. We propose both closed-form and iterative solvers, based on ridge regression and logistic regression components. Our methods constitute a simple and novel approach to the problem of few-shot learning and achieve performance competitive with or superior to the state of the art on three benchmarks.",

While in principle meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) algorithms enable agents to learn new skills from small amounts of experience, several major challenges preclude their practicality. Current methods rely heavily on on-policy experience, limiting their sample efficiency. The also lack mechanisms to reason about task uncertainty when adapting to new tasks, limiting their effectiveness in sparse reward problems. In this paper, we address these challenges by developing an off-policy meta-RL algorithm that disentangles task inference and control. In our approach, we perform online probabilistic filtering of latent task variables to infer how to solve a new task from small amounts of experience. This probabilistic interpretation enables posterior sampling for structured and efficient exploration. We demonstrate how to integrate these task variables with off-policy RL algorithms to achieve both meta-training and adaptation efficiency. Our method outperforms prior algorithms in sample efficiency by 20-100X as well as in asymptotic performance on several meta-RL benchmarks.",

However, a major limitation of such applications is their demand for massive amounts of training data. A critical present objective is thus to develop deep RL methods that can adapt rapidly to new tasks. In the present work we introduce a novel approach to this challenge, which we refer to as deep meta-reinforcement learning. Previous work has shown that recurrent networks can support meta-learning in a fully supervised context. We extend this approach to the RL setting. What emerges is a system that is trained using one RL algorithm, but whose recurrent dynamics implement a second, quite separate RL procedure. This second, learned RL algorithm can differ from the original one in arbitrary ways. Importantly, because it is learned, it is configured to exploit structure in the training domain. We unpack these points in a series of seven proof-of-concept experiments, each of which examines a key aspect of deep meta-RL. We consider prospects for extending and scaling up the approach, and also point out some potentially important implications for neuroscience.",

To tackle these challenges, we proposed a deep-meta-learning based model, entitled ST-MetaNet, to collectively predict traffic in all location at once. ST-MetaNet employs a sequence-to-sequence architecture, consisting of an encoder to learn historical information and a decoder to make predictions step by step. In specific, the encoder and decoder have the same network structure, consisting of a recurrent neural network to encode the traffic, a meta graph attention network to capture diverse spatial correlations, and a meta recurrent neural network to consider diverse temporal correlations. Extensive experiments were conducted based on two real-world datasets to illustrate the effectiveness of ST-MetaNet beyond several state-of-the-art methods.",

We introduce a new metric, joint-policy correlation, to quantify this effect. We describe an algorithm for general MARL, based on approximate best responses to mixtures of policies generated using deep reinforcement learning, and empirical game-theoretic analysis to compute meta-strategies for policy selection. The algorithm generalizes previous ones such as InRL, iterated best response, double oracle, and fictitious play.

However, because the relationship between various wind conditions and its effect on aircraft maneuverability is not well understood, it is challenging to design effective robot controllers using traditional control design methods. We present Neural-Fly, a learning-based approach that allows rapid online adaptation by incorporating pretrained representations through deep learning. Neural-Fly builds on two key observations that aerodynamics in different wind conditions share a common representation and that the wind-specific part lies in a low-dimensional space. To that end, Neural-Fly uses a proposed learning algorithm, domain adversarially invariant meta-learning (DAIML), to learn the shared representation, only using 12 minutes of flight data. With the learned representation as a basis, Neural-Fly then uses a composite adaptation law to update a set of linear coefficients for mixing the basis elements. When evaluated under challenging wind conditions generated with the Caltech Real Weather Wind Tunnel, with wind speeds up to 43.6 kilometers/hour (12.1 meters/second), Neural-Fly achieves precise flight control with substantially smaller tracking error than stateof-the-art nonlinear and adaptive controllers. In addition to strong empirical performance, the exponential stability of Neural-Fly results in robustness guarantees. Last, our control design extrapolates to unseen wind conditions, is shown to be effective for outdoor flights with only onboard sensors, and can transfer across drones with minimal performance degradation.

Despite of the notable success achieved, there is a broad consensus that training DCNNs heavily relies on massive annotated data. Unfortunately, IQA is a typical small sample problem. Therefore, most of the existing DCNN-based IQA metrics operate based on pre-trained networks. However, these pre-trained networks are not designed for IQA task, leading to generalization problem when evaluating different types of distortions. With this motivation, this paper presents a no-reference IQA metric based on deep meta-learning. The underlying idea is to learn the meta-knowledge shared by human when evaluating the quality of images with various distortions, which can then be adapted to unknown distortions easily. Specifically, we first collect a number of NR-IQA tasks for different distortions. Then meta-learning is adopted to learn the prior knowledge shared by diversified distortions. Finally, the quality prior model is fine-tuned on a target NR-IQA task for quickly obtaining the quality model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed metric outperforms the state-of-the-arts by a large margin. Furthermore, the meta-model learned from synthetic distortions can also be easily generalized to authentic distortions, which is highly desired in real-world applications of IQA metrics.",

        "abstract": "Multi-access edge computing (MEC) aims to extend cloud service to the network edge to reduce network traffic and service latency. A fundamental problem in MEC is how to efficiently offload heterogeneous tasks of mobile applications from user equipment (UE) to MEC hosts. Recently, many deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based methods have been proposed to learn offloading policies through interacting with the MEC environment that consists of UE, wireless channels, and MEC hosts. However, these methods have weak adaptability to new environments because they have low sample efficiency and need full retraining to learn updated policies for new environments. To overcome this weakness, we propose a task offloading method based on meta reinforcement learning, which can adapt fast to new environments with a small number of gradient updates and samples. We model mobile applications as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and the offloading policy by a custom sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) neural network. To efficiently train the seq2seq network, we propose a method that synergizes the first order approximation and clipped surrogate objective. The experimental results demonstrate that this new offloading method can reduce the latency by up to 25 percent compared to three baselines while being able to adapt fast to new environments.",

Prior approaches to this problem have hand-specified how human and robot actions correspond and often relied on explicit human pose detection systems. In this work, we present an approach for one-shot learning from a video of a human by using human and robot demonstration data from a variety of previous tasks to build up prior knowledge through meta-learning. Then, combining this prior knowledge and only a single video demonstration from a human, the robot can perform the task that the human demonstrated. We show experiments on both a PR2 arm and a Sawyer arm, demonstrating that after meta-learning, the robot can learn to place, push, and pick-and-place new objects using just one video of a human performing the manipulation.",

Training on noisy labeled datasets causes performance degradation because DNNs can easily overfit to the label noise. To overcome this problem, we propose a noise-tolerant training algorithm, where a meta-learning update is performed prior to conventional gradient update. The proposed meta-learning method simulates actual training by generating synthetic noisy labels, and train the model such that after one gradient update using each set of synthetic noisy labels, the model does not overfit to the specific noise.

In this paper, we address this issue by augmenting minority classes with a recently proposed implicit semantic data augmentation (ISDA) algorithm [37], which produces diversified augmented samples by translating deep features along many semantically meaningful directions. Importantly, given that ISDA estimates the class-conditional statistics to obtain semantic directions, we find it ineffective to do this on minority classes due to the insufficient training data. To this end, we propose a novel approach to learn transformed semantic directions with meta-learning automatically. In specific, the augmentation strategy during training is dynamically optimized, aiming to minimize the loss on a small balanced validation set, which is approximated via a meta update step. Extensive empirical results on CIFAR-LT-10/100, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2017/2018 validate the effectiveness of our method.",

For generalization over unseen instructions, we propose a new objective which encourages learning correspondences between similar subtasks by making analogies. For generalization over sequential instructions, we present a hierarchical architecture where a meta controller learns to use the acquired skills for executing the instructions. To deal with delayed reward, we propose a new neural architecture in the meta controller that learns when to update the subtask, which makes learning more efficient.

To adaptively learn data values jointly with the target task predictor model, we propose a meta learning framework which we name Data Valuation using Reinforcement Learning (DVRL). We employ a data value estimator (modeled by a deep neural network) to learn how likely each datum is used in training of the predictor model. We train the data value estimator using a reinforcement signal of the reward obtained on a small validation set that reflects performance on the target task. We demonstrate that DVRL yields superior data value estimates compared to alternative methods across different types of datasets and in a diverse set of application scenarios. The corrupted sample discovery performance of DVRL is close to optimal in many regimes (i.e. as if the noisy samples were known apriori), and for domain adaptation and robust learning DVRL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art by 14.6% and 10.8%, respectively.",

In this pursuit, we introduce a novel meta-learning approach that seeks to maintain an equilibrium between all the encountered tasks. This is ensured by a new meta-update rule which avoids catastrophic forgetting. In comparison to previous meta-learning techniques, our approach is task-agnostic. When presented with a continuum of data, our model automatically identifies the task and quickly adapts to it with just a single update. We perform extensive experiments on five datasets in a class-incremental setting, leading to significant improvements over the state of the art methods (e.g., a 21.3% boost on CIFAR100 with 10 incremental tasks). Specifically, on large-scale datasets that generally prove difficult cases for incremental learning, our approach delivers absolute gains as high as 19.1% and 7.4% on ImageNet and MS-Celeb datasets, respectively.",

        "abstract": "The ability to learn new concepts with small amounts of data is a critical aspect of intelligence that has proven challenging for deep learning methods. Meta-learning has emerged as a promising technique for leveraging data from previous tasks to enable efficient learning of new tasks. However, most meta-learning algorithms implicitly require that the meta-training tasks be mutually-exclusive, such that no single model can solve all of the tasks at once. For example, when creating tasks for few-shot image classification, prior work uses a per-task random assignment of image classes to N-way classification labels. If this is not done, the meta-learner can ignore the task training data and learn a single model that performs all of the meta-training tasks zero-shot, but does not adapt effectively to new image classes. This requirement means that the user must take great care in designing the tasks, for example by shuffling labels or removing task identifying information from the inputs. In some domains, this makes meta-learning entirely inapplicable. In this paper, we address this challenge by designing a meta-regularization objective using information theory that places precedence on data-driven adaptation. This causes the meta-learner to decide what must be learned from the task training data and what should be inferred from the task testing input. By doing so, our algorithm can successfully use data from non-mutually-exclusive tasks to efficiently adapt to novel tasks. We demonstrate its applicability to both contextual and gradient-based meta-learning algorithms, and apply it in practical settings where applying standard meta-learning has been difficult. Our approach substantially outperforms standard meta-learning algorithms in these settings.",

Yet, the key challenge of how to learn a generalizable classifier with the capability of adapting to specific tasks with severely limited data still remains in this domain. To this end, we propose a Transductive Episodic-wise Adaptive Metric (TEAM) framework for few-shot learning, by integrating the meta-learning paradigm with both deep metric learning and transductive inference. With exploring the pairwise constraints and regularization prior within each task, we explicitly formulate the adaptation procedure into a standard semi-definite programming problem. By solving the problem with its closed-form solution on the fly with the setup of transduction, our approach efficiently tailors an episodic-wise metric for each task to adapt all features from a shared task-agnostic embedding space into a more discriminative task-specific metric space. Moreover, we further leverage an attention-based bi-directional similarity strategy for extracting the more robust relationship between queries and prototypes. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our framework is superior to other existing approaches and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in the few-shot literature.",

However, when processing new hyperspectral images, the existing deep learning models must be retrained from scratch with sufficient samples, which is inefficient and undesirable in practical tasks. This paper aims to explore how to accurately classify new hyperspectral images with only a few labeled samples, i.e., the hyperspectral images few-shot classification. Specifically, we design a new deep classification model based on relational network and train it with the idea of meta-learning. Firstly, the feature learning module and the relation learning module of the model can make full use of the spatial\u2013spectral information in hyperspectral images and carry out relation learning by comparing the similarity between samples. Secondly, the task-based learning strategy can enable the model to continuously enhance its ability to learn how to learn with a large number of tasks randomly generated from different data sets. Benefitting from the above two points, the proposed method has excellent generalization ability and can obtain satisfactory classification results with only a few labeled samples. In order to verify the performance of the proposed method, experiments were carried out on three public data sets. The results indicate that the proposed method can achieve better classification results than the traditional semisupervised support vector machine and semisupervised deep learning models.",

Deep neural network models allow us to represent very complex functions, but lack this capacity for rapid online adaptation. The goal in this paper is to develop a method for continual online learning from an incoming stream of data, using deep neural network models. We formulate an online learning procedure that uses stochastic gradient descent to update model parameters, and an expectation maximization algorithm with a Chinese restaurant process prior to develop and maintain a mixture of models to handle non-stationary task distributions. This allows for all models to be adapted as necessary, with new models instantiated for task changes and old models recalled when previously seen tasks are encountered again. Furthermore, we observe that meta-learning can be used to meta-train a model such that this direct online adaptation with SGD is effective, which is otherwise not the case for large function approximators. In this work, we apply our meta-learning for online learning (MOLe) approach to model-based reinforcement learning, where adapting the predictive model is critical for control; we demonstrate that MOLe outperforms alternative prior methods, and enables effective continuous adaptation in non-stationary task distributions such as varying terrains, motor failures, and unexpected disturbances.",

A popular approach to meta-learning is to train a recurrent model to read in a training dataset as input and output the parameters of a learned model, or output predictions for new test inputs. Alternatively, a more recent approach to meta-learning aims to acquire deep representations that can be effectively fine-tuned, via standard gradient descent, to new tasks. In this paper, we consider the meta-learning problem from the perspective of universality, formalizing the notion of learning algorithm approximation and comparing the expressive power of the aforementioned recurrent models to the more recent approaches that embed gradient descent into the meta-learner. In particular, we seek to answer the following question: does deep representation combined with standard gradient descent have sufficient capacity to approximate any learning algorithm? We find that this is indeed true, and further find, in our experiments, that gradient-based meta-learning consistently leads to learning strategies that generalize more widely compared to those represented by recurrent models.",

We show that such algorithms are possible via Generative Teaching Networks (GTNs), a general approach that is, in theory, applicable to supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, although our experiments only focus on the supervised case. GTNs are deep neural networks that generate data and/or training environments that a learner (e.g. a freshly initialized neural network) trains on for a few SGD steps before being tested on a target task. We then differentiate through the entire learning process via meta-gradients to update the GTN parameters to improve performance on the target task. GTNs have the beneficial property that they can theoretically generate any type of data or training environment, making their potential impact large. This paper introduces GTNs, discusses their potential, and showcases that they can substantially accelerate learning. We also demonstrate a practical and exciting application of GTNs: accelerating the evaluation of candidate architectures for neural architecture search (NAS), which is rate-limited by such evaluations, enabling massive speed-ups in NAS. GTN-NAS improves the NAS state of the art, finding higher performing architectures when controlling for the search proposal mechanism. GTN-NAS also is competitive with the overall state of the art approaches, which achieve top performance while using orders of magnitude less computation than typical NAS methods. Speculating forward, GTNs may represent a first step toward the ambitious goal of algorithms that generate their own training data and, in doing so, open a variety of interesting new research questions and directions.",

Adopting a meta-learning framework, most recent FSL methods meta-learn a deep feature embedding network, and during inference classify novel class samples using nearest neighbor in the learned high-dimensional embedding space. This means that these methods are prone to the hubness problem, that is, a certain class prototype becomes the nearest neighbor of many test instances regardless which classes they belong to. However, this problem is largely ignored in existing FSL studies. In this work, for the first time we show that many FSL methods indeed suffer from the hubness problem. To mitigate its negative effects, we further propose to employ z-score feature normalization, a simple yet effective trans-formation, during meta-training. A theoretical analysis is provided on why it helps. Extensive experiments are then conducted to show that with z-score normalization, the performance of many recent FSL methods can be boosted, resulting in new state-of-the-art on three benchmarks.",

Recent advances in deep learning, especially neural implicit representations, have enabled human shape reconstruction and controllable avatar generation from different sensor inputs. However, to generate realistic cloth deformations from novel input poses, watertight meshes or dense full-body scans are usually needed as inputs. Furthermore, due to the difficulty of effectively modeling pose-dependent cloth deformations for diverse body shapes and cloth types, existing approaches resort to per-subject/cloth-type optimization from scratch, which is computationally expensive. In contrast, we propose an approach that can quickly generate realistic clothed human avatars, represented as controllable neural SDFs, given only monocular depth images. We achieve this by using meta-learning to learn an initialization of a hypernetwork that predicts the parameters of neural SDFs. The hypernetwork is conditioned on human poses and represents a clothed neural avatar that deforms non-rigidly according to the input poses. Meanwhile, it is meta-learned to effectively incorporate priors of diverse body shapes and cloth types and thus can be much faster to fine-tune, compared to models trained from scratch. We qualitatively and quantitatively show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches that require complete meshes as inputs while our approach requires only depth frames as inputs and runs orders of magnitudes faster. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our meta-learned hypernetwork is very robust, being the first to generate avatars with realistic dynamic cloth deformations given as few as 8 monocular depth frames.",

To address the issue, we propose a novel transfer learning approach based on meta-learning that can automatically learn what knowledge to transfer from the source network to where in the target network. Given source and target networks, we propose an efficient training scheme to learn meta-networks that decide (a) which pairs of layers between the source and target networks should be matched for knowledge transfer and (b) which features and how much knowledge from each feature should be transferred. We validate our meta-transfer approach against recent transfer learning methods on various datasets and network architectures, on which our automated scheme significantly outperforms the prior baselines that find \"what and where to transfer\" in a hand-crafted manner.",

However, there are several challenges that prevent the widespread implementation of deep learning algorithms in actual clinical settings, including unclear prediction confidence and limited training data for new T1D subjects. To this end, we propose a novel deep learning framework, Fast-adaptive and Confident Neural Network (FCNN), to meet these clinical challenges. In particular, an attention-based recurrent neural network is used to learn representations from CGM input and forward a weighted sum of hidden states to an evidential output layer, aiming to compute personalized BG predictions with theoretically supported model confidence. The model-agnostic meta-learning is employed to enable fast adaptation for a new T1D subject with limited training data. The proposed framework has been validated on three clinical datasets. In particular, for a dataset including 12 subjects with T1D, FCNN achieved a root mean square error of 18.64\u00b12.60 mg/dL and 31.07\u00b13.62 mg/dL for 30 and 60-minute prediction horizons, respectively, which outperformed all the considered baseline methods with significant improvements. These results indicate that FCNN is a viable and effective approach for predicting BG levels in T1D. The well-trained models can be implemented in smartphone apps to improve glycemic control by enabling proactive actions through real-time glucose alerts.",

However, these methods, whether based on pure statistical signal processing or data-driven approaches, often struggle to generalize to new environments, which results in considerable time and effort being wasted. To address this challenge, we propose MetaLoc, which is the first fingerprinting-based localization framework that leverages the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Specifically, built on a deep neural network with strong representation capabilities, MetaLoc is trained on historical data sourced from well-calibrated environments, employing a two-loop optimization mechanism to obtain the meta-parameters. These meta-parameters act as the initialization for quick adaptation in new environments, reducing the need for much human effort. The framework introduces two paradigms for the optimization of meta-parameters: a centralized paradigm that simplifies the process by sharing data from all historical environments, and a distributed paradigm that maintains data privacy by training meta-parameters for each specific environment separately. Furthermore, the advanced distributed paradigm modifies the vanilla MAML loss function to ensure that the reduction of loss occurs in a consistent direction across various training domains, thus facilitating faster convergence during training. Our experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that MetaLoc outperforms baseline methods in terms of localization accuracy, robustness, and cost-effectiveness.

In the proposed algorithm, compound skills and basic skills are learned by two levels of hierarchy. In the first level of hierarchy, each basic skill is handled by its own actor, overseen by a shared basic critic. Then, in the second level of hierarchy, compound skills are learned by a meta critic by reusing basic skills. The proposed algorithm was evaluated on a Pioneer 3AT robot in three different navigation scenarios with fully observable tasks. The simulations were built in Gazebo 2 in a robot operating system Indigo environment.

However, the majority of methods focus on designing network architectures to better capture feature interactions while the feature embedding, especially for numerical features, has been overlooked. Existing approaches for numerical features are difficult to capture informative knowledge because of the low capacity or hard discretization based on the offline expertise feature engineering. In this paper, we propose a novel embedding learning framework for numerical features in CTR prediction (AutoDis) with high model capacity, end-to-end training and unique representation properties preserved. AutoDis consists of three core components: meta-embeddings, automatic discretization and aggregation. Specifically, we propose meta-embeddings for each numerical field to learn global knowledge from the perspective of field with a manageable number of parameters. Then the differentiable automatic discretization performs soft discretization and captures the correlations between the numerical features and meta-embeddings. Finally, distinctive and informative embeddings are learned via an aggregation function. Comprehensive experiments on two public and one industrial datasets are conducted to validate the effectiveness of AutoDis. Moreover, AutoDis has been deployed onto a mainstream advertising platform, where online A/B test demonstrates the improvement over the base model by 2.1% and 2.7% in terms of CTR and eCPM, respectively.

        "abstract": "The industrial advancement has promoted the development of deep learning (DL)-based intelligent fault diagnosis methods for condition-based maintenance (CBM). Though these methods rely on large dataset for training, the collection of large number of fault samples is not practically feasible. For this purpose, generative adversarial networks (GANs) are capable to generate high-quality synthetic samples. However, the problem still persists with the training of GAN using limited fault samples that are present in practical conditions. This article proposes a novel conditional auxiliary classifier GAN framework coupled with model agnostic meta learning (MAML) to resolve this problem. The objective is to initialize and update the network parameters using MAML instead of regular stochastic gradient learning. This modification enables GAN to learn the task of synthetic sample generation using the limited training dataset. The effectiveness of the proposed framework has been compared with several famous state-of-the-art intelligent fault diagnosis methods existing in the literature. The comparative performance has been validated on benchmarked datasets, i.e., air compressor and bearing datasets collected from a single-stage reciprocating air compressor. The proposed framework is able to achieve the classification accuracy of 99.26% and 98.55% for bearing and air compressor datasets, respectively, with only ten samples per class. Moreover, a real-time case study is performed to validate the proposed method in real time.",

Our goal is a general approach for learning equivariances from data, without needing prior knowledge of a task's symmetries or custom task-specific architectures. We present a method for learning and encoding equivariances into networks by learning corresponding parameter sharing patterns from data.

In this paper, we propose a simple approach to improve the representation capacity of deep neural networks for few-shot learning tasks. We follow a two-stage learning process: First, we train a neural network to maximize the entropy of the feature embedding, thus creating an optimal output manifold using a self-supervised auxiliary loss. In the second stage, we minimize the entropy on feature embedding by bringing self-supervised twins together, while constraining the manifold with student-teacher distillation. Our experiments show that, even in the first stage, self-supervision can outperform current state-of-the-art methods, with further gains achieved by our second stage distillation process.

Meta-learning is an effective and practical framework for solving this problem in deep learning. This paper proposes a new meta-learning based hyperspectral target detection using Siamese network (MLSN). Firstly, a deep residual convolution feature embedding module is designed to embed spectral vectors into Euclidean feature space. Then, the triplet loss is used to learn the intraclass similarity and interclass dissimilarity between spectra in embedding feature space by using the known labeled source data on the designed three-channel Siamese network for meta-training. The learned meta-knowledge is updated with prior target spectrum through a designed two-channel Siamese network to quickly adapt to the new detection task. It should be noted that the parameters and structure of the deep residual convolution embedding modules of each channel in the Siamese network are identical. Lastly, the spatial information is combined, and the detection map of the two-channel Siamese network is processed by the guiding image filtering and morphological closing operation, and a final detection result is obtained. Based on the experimental analysis of six real hyperspectral image data sets, the proposed MLSN has shown its excellent comprehensive performance.",

For 3D medical images, it is often impractical to build a large homogeneous annotated dataset for a specific pathology. Self-supervised methods offer a new way to learn a representation of the images in an unsupervised manner with a neural network. In particular, contrastive learning has shown great promises by (almost) matching the performance of fully-supervised CNN on vision tasks. Nonetheless, this method does not take advantage of available meta-data, such as participant's age, viewed as prior knowledge. Here, we propose to leverage continuous proxy metadata, in the contrastive learning framework, by introducing a new loss called y-Aware InfoNCE loss. Specifically, we improve the positive sampling during pre-training by adding more positive examples with similar proxy meta-data with the anchor, assuming they share similar discriminative semantic features.With our method, a 3D CNN model pre-trained on $10^4$ multi-site healthy brain MRI scans can extract relevant features for three classification tasks: schizophrenia, bipolar diagnosis and Alzheimer's detection. When fine-tuned, it also outperforms 3D CNN trained from scratch on these tasks, as well as state-of-the-art self-supervised methods. Our code is made publicly available here.",

In contrast to previous work, we propose to rethink HPO as a few-shot learning problem in which we train a shared deep surrogate model to quickly adapt (with few response evaluations) to the response function of a new task. We propose the use of a deep kernel network for a Gaussian process surrogate that is meta-learned in an end-to-end fashion in order to jointly approximate the response functions of a collection of training data sets. As a result, the novel few-shot optimization of our deep kernel surrogate leads to new state-of-the-art results at HPO compared to several recent methods on diverse metadata sets.",

We use the meta-path structure to analyze the connections involving semantics in heterogeneous graphs and utilize graph convolution module and semantic-level attention mechanism to capture local representations. By maximizing local-global mutual information, HDGI effectively learns high-level node representations that can be utilized in downstream graph-related tasks. Experiment results show that HDGI remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised graph representation learning methods on both classification and clustering tasks.

As indispensable components to many mission-critical CPS assets and equipment, mechanical bearings need to be monitored to identify any trace of abnormal conditions. Most of the data-driven approaches applied to bearing fault diagnosis up-to-date are trained using a large amount of fault data collected a priori. In many practical applications, however, it can be unsafe and time-consuming to collect sufficient data samples for each fault category, making it challenging to train a robust classifier. In this article, we propose a few-shot learning framework for bearing fault diagnosis based on model-agnostic meta-learning, which targets for training an effective fault classifier using limited data. In addition, it can leverage the training data and learn to identify new fault scenarios more efficiently. Case studies on the generalization to new artificial faults show that the proposed framework achieves an overall accuracy up to 25% higher than a Siamese-network-based benchmark study. Finally, the robustness and the generalization capability of the proposed framework is further validated by applying it to identify real bearing damages using data from artificial damages, which compares favorably against six state-of-the-art few-shot learning algorithms using consistent test environments.",

The framework is composed of three modules, a concept generator, a meta-learner, and a concept discriminator, which are learned jointly. The concept generator, e.g. a deep residual net, extracts a representation for each instance that captures its high-level concept, on which the meta-learner performs few-shot learning, and the concept discriminator recognizes the concepts. By learning to learn in the concept space rather than in the complicated instance space, deep meta-learning can substantially improve vanilla meta-learning, which is demonstrated on various few-shot image recognition problems.

The concept of meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) has been recently proposed to enable agents to learn similar but new skills from a small amount of experience by leveraging a set of tasks with a shared structure. Due to the task representation learning strategy with few-shot adaptation, most recent work is limited to narrow task distributions and stationary environments, where tasks do not change within episodes. In this work, we address those limitations and introduce a training strategy that is applicable to non-stationary environments, as well as a task representation based on Gaussian mixture models to model clustered task distributions. We evaluate our method on several continuous robotic control benchmarks. Compared with state-of-the-art literature that is only applicable to stationary environments with few-shot adaption, our algorithm first achieves competitive asymptotic performance and superior sample efficiency in stationary environments with zero-shot adaption. Second, our algorithm learns to perform successfully in non-stationary settings as well as a continual learning setting, while learning well-structured task representations.

This problem has been proved to be NP-hard, and most of the proposed techniques suffer from the efficiency issue due to the lack of generalization. Even worse, the design of these algorithms requires significant specialized knowledge which is hard to be understood and implemented. To overcome these issues, this paper aims to learn a generalized heuristic framework to solve TIM problems by meta-learning. To this end, we first propose two topic-aware social influence propagation models based on IC and LT model, respectively, which is conducive to better advertising injections. We then encode the feature of each node by a vector and introduce a model, called deep influence evaluation model , to evaluate the user influence under different circumstances. Based on this model, we can construct the solution according to the influence evaluations efficiently, rather than spending a high cost to compute the exact influence by considering the complex graph structure.

Deep learning based models show good performance when trained on large amounts of labeled data on events of interest, whereas the performance of models tends to degrade on other events due to domain shift. Therefore, significant challenges are posed for existing detection approaches to detect fake news on emergent events, where large-scale labeled datasets are difficult to obtain. Moreover, adding the knowledge from newly emergent events requires to build a new model from scratch or continue to fine-tune the model, which can be challenging, expensive, and unrealistic for real-world settings. In order to address those challenges, we propose an end-to-end fake news detection framework named MetaFEND, which is able to learn quickly to detect fake news on emergent events with a few verified posts. Specifically, the proposed model integrates meta-learning and neural process methods together to enjoy the benefits of these approaches. In particular, a label embedding module and a hard attention mechanism are proposed to enhance the effectiveness by handling categorical information and trimming irrelevant posts.

        "abstract": "While deep reinforcement learning methods have shown impressive results in robot learning, their sample inefficiency makes the learning of complex, long-horizon behaviors with real robot systems infeasible. To mitigate this issue, meta-reinforcement learning methods aim to enable fast learning on novel tasks by learning how to learn. Yet, the application has been limited to short-horizon tasks with dense rewards. To enable learning long-horizon behaviors, recent works have explored leveraging prior experience in the form of offline datasets without reward or task annotations. While these approaches yield improved sample efficiency, millions of interactions with environments are still required to solve complex tasks. In this work, we devise a method that enables meta-learning on long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks, allowing us to solve unseen target tasks with orders of magnitude fewer environment interactions. Our core idea is to leverage prior experience extracted from offline datasets during meta-learning. Specifically, we propose to (1) extract reusable skills and a skill prior from offline datasets, (2) meta-train a high-level policy that learns to efficiently compose learned skills into long-horizon behaviors, and (3) rapidly adapt the meta-trained policy to solve an unseen target task. Experimental results on continuous control tasks in navigation and manipulation demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently solve long-horizon novel target tasks by combining the strengths of meta-learning and the usage of offline datasets, while prior approaches in RL, meta-RL, and multi-task RL require substantially more environment interactions to solve the tasks.",

Due to the lack of big training data, the efforts of existing metrics in optimizing CNN-based NR-IQA models remain limited. Furthermore, the diversity of distortions in images result in the generalization problem of NR-IQA models when trained with known distortions and tested on unseen distortions, which is an easy task for human. Hence, we propose a NR-IQA metric via deep meta-learning, which is highly generalizable in the face of unseen distortions. The fundamental idea is to learn the meta-knowledge shared by human when evaluating the quality of images with diversified distortions. Specifically, we define NR-IQA of different distortions as a series of tasks and propose a task selection strategy to build two task sets, which are characterized by synthetic to synthetic and synthetic to authentic distortions, respectively. Based on these two task sets, an optimization-based meta-learning is proposed to learn the generalized NR-IQA model, which can be directly used to evaluate the quality of images with unseen distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our NR-IQA metric outperforms the state-of-the-arts in terms of both evaluation performance and generalization ability.",

In this work, we propose an algorithm based on meta-gradient descent that discovers its own objective, flexibly parameterised by a deep neural network, solely from interactive experience with its environment. Over time, this allows the agent to learn how to learn increasingly effectively. Furthermore, because the objective is discovered online, it can adapt to changes over time. We demonstrate that the algorithm discovers how to address several important issues in RL, such as bootstrapping, non-stationarity, and off-policy learning. On the Atari Learning Environment, the meta-gradient algorithm adapts over time to learn with greater efficiency, eventually outperforming the median score of a strong actor-critic baseline.",

However, RL methods face the following challenges in steering predictive autoscaling, such as lack of accuracy in decision-making, inefficient sampling and significant variability in workload patterns that may cause policies to fail at test time. To this end, we propose an end-to-end predictive meta model-based RL algorithm, aiming to optimally allocate resource to maintain a stable CPU utilization level, which incorporates a specially-designed deep periodic workload prediction model as the input and embeds the Neural Process [11, 16] to guide the learning of the optimal scaling actions over numerous application services in the Cloud. Our algorithm not only ensures the predictability and accuracy of the scaling strategy, but also enables the scaling decisions to adapt to the changing workloads with high sample efficiency.

The proposed method utilizes convolutional long short-term memory (convLSTM) to aggregate rich spatial-temporal information in the past. The network is able to memorize and learn from its past experience for better estimation and fast adaptation to the current frame. When running VO in the open world, in order to deal with the changing environment, we propose an online feature alignment method by aligning feature distributions at different time.

CDCS employs a transfer learning framework where an initial program representation model is pre-trained on a large corpus of common programming languages (such as Java and Python), and is further adapted to domain-specific languages such as Solidity and SQL. Un-like cross-language CodeBERT, which is directly fine-tuned in the target language, CDCS adapts a few-shot meta-learning algorithm called MAML to learn the good initialization of model parameters, which can be best reused in a domain-specific language. We evaluate the proposed approach on two domain-specific languages, namely Solidity and SQL, with model transferred from two widely used languages (Python and Java). Experimental results show that CDCS significantly outperforms conventional pre-trained code models that are directly fine-tuned in domain-specific languages, and it is particularly effective for scarce data.",

We model an active learning algorithm as a deep neural network that inputs the base learner state and the unlabelled point set and predicts the best point to annotate next. Training this active query policy network with reinforcement learning, produces the best non-myopic policy for a given dataset. The key challenge in achieving a general solution to AL then becomes that of learner generalisation, particularly across heterogeneous datasets. We propose a multi-task dataset-embedding approach that allows dataset-agnostic active learners to be trained.

However, unlike the existing strategy to include as many data-adaptive components in the unrolled dynamics model as possible, we find that it is enough to only learn the parts where traditional designs mostly rely on intuitions and experience. More specifically, we propose to learn an initializer for the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm that involved in one of the subproblems of the backbone model. Other components, such as image priors and hyperparameters, are kept as the original design. Since a hypernetwork is introduced to inference on the initialization of the CG module, it makes the proposed model a certain meta-learning model. Therefore, we shall call the proposed model the meta-inversion network (MetaInv-Net). The proposed MetaInv-Net can be designed with much less trainable parameters while still preserves its superior image reconstruction performance than some state-of-the-art deep models in CT imaging. In simulated and real data experiments, MetaInv-Net performs very well and can be generalized beyond the training setting, i.e., to other scanning settings, noise levels, and data sets.",

Recent deep learning-based models that exploit feature embedding and high-order data nonlinearity have shown dramatic successes in CTR prediction. However, these models work poorly on cold-start ads with new IDs, whose embeddings are not well learned yet. In this paper, we propose Graph Meta Embedding (GME) models that can rapidly learn how to generate desirable initial embeddings for new ad IDs based on graph neural networks and meta learning. Previous works address this problem from the new ad itself, but ignore possibly useful information contained in existing old ads. In contrast, GMEs simultaneously consider two information sources: the new ad and existing old ads. For the new ad, GMEs exploit its associated attributes. For existing old ads, GMEs first build a graph to connect them with new ads, and then adaptively distill useful information. We propose three specific GMEs from different perspectives to explore what kind of information to use and how to distill information. In particular, GME-P uses Pre-trained neighbor ID embeddings, GME-G uses Generated neighbor ID embeddings and GME-A uses neighbor Attributes. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that GMEs can significantly improve the prediction performance in both cold-start (i.e., no training data is available) and warm-up (i.e., a small number of training samples are collected) scenarios over five major deep learning-based CTR prediction models. GMEs can be applied to conversion rate (CVR) prediction as well.",

A key challenge for current deep reinforcement learning models lies in the requirements for a large amount of training data. It is exceedingly expensive to construct sufficient 3D synthetic environments annotated with the target object information. In this paper, we focus on visual navigation in the low-resource setting, where we have only a few training environments annotated with object information. We propose a novel unsupervised reinforcement learning approach to learn transferable meta-skills (e.g., bypass obstacles, go straight) from unannotated environments without any supervisory signals. The agent can then fast adapt to visual navigation through learning a high-level master policy to combine these meta-skills, when the visual-navigation-specified reward is provided. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the baseline by 53.34% relatively on SPL, and further qualitative analysis demonstrates that our method learns transferable motor primitives for visual navigation.",

Second, and more subtly, existing methods typically assume demonstrations for one, isolated behavior or task, while in practice, it is significantly more natural and scalable to provide datasets of heterogeneous behaviors. To this end, we propose a deep latent variable model that is capable of learning rewards from unstructured, multi-task demonstration data, and critically, use this experience to infer robust rewards for new, structurally-similar tasks from a single demonstration.

The optimal adaptive behaviour under uncertainty over the other agents' strategies w.r.t. some prior can in principle be computed using the Interactive Bayesian Reinforcement Learning framework. Unfortunately, doing so is intractable in most settings, and existing approximation methods are restricted to small tasks. To overcome this, we propose to meta-learn approximate belief inference and Bayes-optimal behaviour for a given prior. To model beliefs over other agents, we combine sequential and hierarchical Variational Auto-Encoders, and meta-train this inference model alongside the policy. We show empirically that our approach outperforms existing methods that use a model-free approach, sample from the approximate posterior, maintain memory-free models of others, or do not fully utilise the known structure of the environment.",

The goal of such work is discovering unknown physics and the corresponding equations. However, prior to achieving this goal, major challenges remain to be resolved, including learning PDE under noisy data and limited discrete data. To overcome these challenges, in this work, a deep-learning based data-driven method, called DL-PDE, is developed to discover the governing PDEs of underlying physical processes. The DL-PDE method combines deep learning via neural networks and data-driven discovery of PDE via sparse regressions. In the DL-PDE, a neural network is first trained, and then a large amount of meta-data is generated, and the required derivatives are calculated by automatic differentiation. Finally, the form of PDE is discovered by sparse regression. The proposed method is tested with physical processes, governed by groundwater flow equation, convection-diffusion equation, Burgers equation and Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, for proof-of-concept and applications in real-world engineering settings. The proposed method achieves satisfactory results when data are noisy and limited.",

However, existing endeavors predominately focus on the conventional semi-supervised setting where relatively abundant gold-labeled nodes are provided. While it is often impractical due to the fact that data labeling is unbearably laborious and requires intensive domain knowledge, especially when considering the heterogeneity of graph-structured data. Under the few-shot semi-supervised setting, the performance of most of the existing GNNs is inevitably undermined by the overfitting and oversmoothing issues, largely owing to the shortage of labeled data. In this paper, we propose a decoupled network architecture equipped with a novel meta-learning algorithm to solve this problem. In essence, our framework Meta-PN infers high-quality pseudo labels on unlabeled nodes via a meta-learned label propagation strategy, which effectively augments the scarce labeled data while enabling large receptive fields during training.

Recently, deep learning-based palmprint recognition algorithms have improved the accuracy and robustness of recognition results to a new level. Most of them require a large amount of labeled training samples to guarantee satisfactory performance. However, getting enough labeled data is difficult due to time consumption and privacy issues. Therefore, in this article, a novel meta-Siamese network (MSN) is proposed to exploit few-shot learning for small-sample palmprint recognition. During each episode-based training iteration, a few images are selected as sample and query sets to simulate the support and testing sets in the test set. Specifically, the model is trained episodically with a flexible framework to learn both the feature embedding and deep similarity metric function. In addition, two distance-based losses are introduced to assist the optimization. After training, the model can learn the ability to get similarity scores between two images for few-shot testing. Adequate experiments conducted on several constrained and unconstrained benchmark palmprint databases show that MSN can obtain competitive improvements compared with baseline methods, where the best accuracy can be up to 100%.",

In this paper, first, we propose a meta-feature extractor called Dataset2Vec that combines the versatility of engineered dataset meta-features with the expressivity of meta-features learned by deep neural networks. Primary learning tasks or datasets are represented as hierarchical sets, i.e., as a set of sets, esp. as a set of predictor/target pairs, and then a DeepSet architecture is employed to regress meta-features on them. Second, we propose a novel auxiliary meta-learning task with abundant data called dataset similarity learning that aims to predict if two batches stem from the same dataset or different ones. In an experiment on a large-scale hyperparameter optimization task for 120 UCI datasets with varying schemas as a meta-learning task, we show that the meta-features of Dataset2Vec outperform the expert engineered meta-features and thus demonstrate the usefulness of learned meta-features for datasets with varying schemas for the first time.",

Indeed, while naive deep time-index models are far more expressive than the manually predefined function representations of classical time-index models, they are inadequate for forecasting, being unable to generalize to unseen time steps due to the lack of inductive bias. In this paper, we propose DeepTime, a meta-optimization framework to learn deep time-index models which overcome these limitations, yielding an efficient and accurate forecasting model.

Specifically, we sample some subsets from the original training set and learn metrics across different subsets. In each sampled sub-task, we split the training data into a support set as well as a query set, and learn the set-based distance, instead of sample-based one, to verify the query cell from multiple support cells. In addition, we introduce hard sample mining for set-based distance to encourage the intra-class compactness.

Adaptive filters typically operate via specialized online, iterative optimization methods such as least-mean squares or recursive least squares and aim to process signals in unknown or nonstationary environments. Such algorithms, however, can be slow and laborious to develop, require domain expertise to create, and necessitate mathematical insight for improvement. In this work, we seek to improve upon hand-derived adaptive filter algorithms and present a comprehensive framework for learning online, adaptive signal processing algorithms or update rules directly from data. To do so, we frame the development of adaptive filters as a meta-learning problem in the context of deep learning and use a form of self-supervision to learn online iterative update rules for adaptive filters. To demonstrate our approach, we focus on audio applications and systematically develop meta-learned adaptive filters for five canonical audio problems including system identification, acoustic echo cancellation, blind equalization, multi-channel dereverberation, and beamforming.We compare our approach against common baselines and/or recent state-of-the-art methods. We show we can learn high-performing adaptive filters that operate in real-time and, in most cases, significantly outperform each method we compare against \u2013 all using a single general-purpose configuration of our approach.",

Yet, the development of prevention strategies remains a challenging process, as epidemics are non-linear and complex processes. For this reason, we investigate a deep reinforcement learning approach to automatically learn prevention strategies in the context of pandemic influenza. Firstly, we construct a new epidemiological meta-population model, with 379 patches (one for each administrative district in Great Britain), that adequately captures the infection process of pandemic influenza. Our model balances complexity and computational efficiency such that the use of reinforcement learning techniques becomes attainable. Secondly, we set up a ground truth such that we can evaluate the performance of the 'Proximal Policy Optimization' algorithm to learn in a single district of this epidemiological model. Finally, we consider a large-scale problem, by conducting an experiment where we aim to learn a joint policy to control the districts in a community of 11 tightly coupled districts, for which no ground truth can be established. This experiment shows that deep reinforcement learning can be used to learn mitigation policies in complex epidemiological models with a large state space. Moreover, through this experiment, we demonstrate that there can be an advantage to consider collaboration between districts when designing prevention strategies.",

To address this problem, we propose a Meta Soft Label Generation algorithm called MSLG, which can jointly generate soft labels using meta-learning techniques and learn DNN parameters in an end-to-end fashion. Our approach adapts the meta-learning paradigm to estimate optimal label distribution by checking gradient directions on both noisy training data and noise-free meta-data. In order to iteratively update soft labels, meta-gradient descent step is performed on estimated labels, which would minimize the loss of noise-free meta samples. In each iteration, the base classifier is trained on estimated meta labels. MSLG is model-agnostic and can be added on top of any existing model at hand with ease. We performed extensive experiments on CIFAR10, Clothing1M and Food101N datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

Recent efforts apply meta-learning to learn a meta-learner from a set of RL tasks such that a novel but related task could be solved quickly. Though specific in some ways, different tasks in meta-RL are generally similar at a high level. However, most meta-RL methods do not explicitly and adequately model the specific and shared information among different tasks, which limits their ability to learn training tasks and to generalize to novel tasks. In this paper, we propose to capture the shared information on the one hand and meta-learn how to quickly abstract the specific information about a task on the other hand. Methodologically, we train an SGD meta-learner to quickly optimize a task encoder for each task, which generates a task embedding based on past experience. Meanwhile, we learn a policy which is shared across all tasks and conditioned on task embeddings. Empirical results on four simulated tasks demonstrate that our method has better learning capacity on both training and novel tasks and attains up to 3 to 4 times higher returns compared to baselines.",

In this paper, we study a new problem of 3D Domain Generalization (3DDG) with the goal to generalize the model to other unseen domains of point clouds without any access to them in the training process. It is a challenging problem due to the substantial geometry shift from simulated to real data, such that most existing 3D models underperform due to overfitting the complete geometries in the source domain. We propose to tackle this problem via MetaSets, which meta-learns point cloud representations from a group of classification tasks on carefully-designed transformed point sets containing specific geometry priors. The learned representations are more generalizable to various unseen domains of different geometries. We design two benchmarks for Sim-to-Real transfer of 3D point clouds. Experimental results show that MetaSets outperforms existing 3D deep learning methods by large margins.",

This setup makes a step towards mimicking how humans make use of a diverse set of prior skills to learn new skills. Previous work has achieved encouraging performance. In particular, in spite of the diversity of the multimodal tasks, previous work claims that a single meta-learner trained on a multimodal distribution can sometimes outperform multiple specialized meta-learners trained on individual unimodal distributions. The improvement is attributed to knowledge transfer between different modes of task distributions. However, there is no deep investigation to verify and understand the knowledge transfer between multimodal tasks. Our work makes two contributions to multimodal meta-learning. First, we propose a method to quantify knowledge transfer between tasks of different modes at a micro-level. Our quantitative, task-level analysis is inspired by the recent transference idea from multi-task learning. Second, inspired by hard parameter sharing in multi-task learning and a new interpretation of related work, we propose a new multimodal meta-learner that outperforms existing work by considerable margins. While the major focus is on multimodal meta-learning, our work also attempts to shed light on task interaction in conventional meta-learning.

Conventional deep learning (DL) based models for HGR rely on a large amount of labelled data for training to achieve a satisfactory recognition accuracy. However, it is usually time-consuming and labor-intensive for collecting large amounts of radar data and also difficult to cover all possible hand gesture classes. In this paper, we introduce meta-learning to address the few-shot learning problem for frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar based HGR. We propose a meta-learning network to learn a model that can quickly adapt to unseen hand gesture tasks with few training observations. In particular, we propose a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) based dual-channel fusion network for feature extraction by exploiting the correlations of multiple features in radar echo signals to improve the recognition accuracy. In addition, we also develop a learnable relation module with neural networks as a non-linear classifier to measure the similarity between the samples of different hand gestures, which can be more applicable for the HGR task. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed model by conducting experiments on an FMCW radar hardware system. Experimental results show that the proposed meta-learning model substantially enhances the recognition accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art methods including DL and meta-learning based models for FMCW radar-based HGR.",

Most of these techniques are either unsupervised or semi-supervised because of a lack of a large number of labeled anomalies. However, they typically rely on a clean training data not polluted by anomalies to learn the distribution of the normal data. Otherwise, the learned distribution tends to be distorted and hence ineffective in distinguishing between normal and abnormal data. To solve this problem, we propose a novel approach called ELITE that uses a small number of labeled examples to infer the anomalies hidden in the training samples. It then turns these anomalies into useful signals that help to better detect anomalies from user data. Unlike the classical semi-supervised classification strategy which uses labeled examples as training data, ELITE uses them as validation set. It leverages the gradient of the validation loss to predict if one training sample is abnormal. The intuition is that correctly identifying the hidden anomalies could produce a better deep anomaly model with reduced validation loss. Our experiments on public benchmark datasets show that ELITE achieves up to 30% improvement in ROC AUC comparing to the state-of-the-art, yet robust to polluted training data.",

Currently, the shortage of data has become an obstacle to leverage deep learning methods. Few-shot learning can generalize to new categories with the supports of few samples, which is very helpful for those plant disease categories where only few samples are available. However, two challenging problems are existing in few-shot learning: (1) the feature extracted from few shots is very limited; (2) generalizing to new categories, especially to another domain is very tough. In response to the two issues, we propose a network based on the Meta-Baseline few-shot learning method, and combine cascaded multi-scale features and channel attention. The network takes advantage of multi-scale features to rich the feature representation, uses channel attention as a compensation module efficiently to learn more from the significant channels of the fused features. Meanwhile, we propose a group of training strategies from data configuration perspective to match various generalization requirements. Through extensive experiments, it is verified that the combination of multi-scale feature fusion and channel attention can alleviate the problem of limited features caused by few shots. To imitate different generalization scenarios, we set different data settings and suggest the optimal training strategies for intra-domain case and cross-domain case, respectively. The effects of important factors in few-shot learning paradigm are analyzed. With the optimal configuration, the accuracy of 1-shot task and 5-shot task achieve at 61.24% and 77.43% respectively in the task targeting to single-plant, and achieve at 82.52% and 92.83% in the task targeting to multi-plants. Our results outperform the existing related works. It demonstrates that the few-shot learning is a feasible potential solution for plant disease recognition in the future application.",

In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective method to alleviate the risk of overfitting for gradient-based meta-learning. Specifically, during the gradient-based adaptation stage, we randomly drop the gradient in the inner-loop optimization of each parameter in deep neural networks, such that the augmented gradients improve generalization to new tasks. We present a general form of the proposed gradient dropout regularization and show that this term can be sampled from either the Bernoulli or Gaussian distribution. To validate the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments and analysis on numerous computer vision tasks, demonstrating that the gradient dropout regularization mitigates the overfitting problem and improves the performance upon various gradient-based meta-learning frameworks.",

In this paper, we show that many bias variations such as ethnicity, head pose, occlusion and blur can jointly affect the accuracy significantly. We propose a sample level weighting approach termed Multi-variation Cosine Margin (MvCoM), to simultaneously consider the multiple variation factors, which orthogonally enhances the face recognition losses to incorporate the importance of training samples. Further, we leverage a learning to learn approach, guided by a held-out meta learning set and use an additive modeling to predict the MvCoM.

This is implicit and rather insufficient to learn a task well. On the con-trary, humans are usually taught new skills via natural language instructions. Utilizing language instructions for robotic motion control to improve the adaptability is a recently emerged topic and challenging. In this paper, we present a meta-RL algorithm that addresses the challenge of learning skills with language instructions in multiple manipulation tasks. On the one hand, our algorithm utilizes the language instructions to shape its in-terpretation of the task, on the other hand, it still learns to solve task in a trial-and-error process. We evaluate our algorithm on the robotic manipulation benchmark (Meta-World) and it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of training and testing task success rates.

        "abstract": "The aim of Few-Shot learning methods is to train models which can easily adapt to previously unseen tasks, based on small amounts of data. One of the most popular and elegant Few-Shot learning approaches is Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). The main idea behind this method is to learn the general weights of the meta-model, which are further adapted to specific problems in a small number of gradient steps. However, the model's main limitation lies in the fact that the update procedure is realized by gradient-based optimisation. In consequence, MAML cannot always modify weights to the essential level in one or even a few gradient iterations. On the other hand, using many gradient steps results in a complex and time-consuming optimization procedure, which is hard to train in practice, and may lead to overfitting. In this paper, we propose HyperMAML, a novel generalization of MAML, where the training of the update procedure is also part of the model. Namely, in HyperMAML, instead of updating the weights with gradient descent, we use for this purpose a trainable Hypernetwork. Consequently, in this framework, the model can generate significant updates whose range is not limited to a fixed number of gradient steps. Experiments show that HyperMAML consistently outperforms MAML and performs comparably to other state-of-the-art techniques in a number of standard Few-Shot learning benchmarks.",

However, local synaptic learning rules like those employed by the brain have so far failed to match the performance of backpropagation in deep networks. In this study, we employ meta-learning to discover networks that learn using feedback connections and local, biologically inspired learning rules. Importantly, the feedback connections are not tied to the feedforward weights, avoiding biologically implausible weight transport. Our experiments show that meta-trained networks effectively use feedback connections to perform online credit assignment in multi-layer architectures. Surprisingly, this approach matches or exceeds a state-of-the-art gradient-based online meta-learning algorithm on regression and classification tasks, excelling in particular at continual learning. Analysis of the weight updates employed by these models reveals that they differ qualitatively from gradient descent in a way that reduces interference between updates. Our results suggest the existence of a class of biologically plausible learning mechanisms that not only match gradient descent-based learning, but also overcome its limitations.",

To break the scenario-specific localization bottleneck, we propose a new-fashioned data-driven fingerprinting method for localization based on meta-learning, named by MetaLoc, that can adapt itself rapidly to a new, possibly unseen, scenario with very little calibration work. Specifically, the underlying localization model is taken to be a deep neural network (NN), and we train an optimal set of group-specific meta-parameters by leveraging historical data collected from diverse well-calibrated indoor scenarios and the maximum mean discrepancy criterion. Simulation results confirm that the meta-parameters obtained for MetaLoc achieves very rapid adaptation to new scenarios, competitive localization accuracy, and high resistance to significantly reduced reference points (RPs), saving a lot of calibration effort.",

Simply integrating the YOLO mechanism into a meta-learning pipeline will encounter problems in terms of computational efficiency and mistake detection. Therefore, we construct a two-stage meta-learner \u2131 model that can learn the learner initialization, the learner update direction and learning rate, all in a single meta-learning process. To facilitate deep networks with learning, the fidelity features of the targets improve the performance of meta-learner \u2131, but we also design a feature decorrelation module (FDM), which firstly transforms non-linear features into computable linear features based on RFF, and secondly perceives and removes global correlations by iteratively saving and reloading the features and sample weights of the model. We introduce a three-head module to learn global, local and patch correlations with the category detection result outputted by the aggregation in meta-learner \u2131, which endows a multi-scale ability with detector \u03d5.

The DL-based methods typically extract structural information from source code, e.g., code structure graph, and adopt neural networks such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn the graph representations. However, these methods fail to consider the heterogeneous relations in the code structure graph, i.e., the heterogeneous relations mean that the different types of edges connect different types of nodes in the graph, which may obstruct the graph representation learning. Besides, these methods are limited in capturing long-range dependencies due to the deep levels in the code structure graph. In this paper, we propose a Meta-path based Attentional Graph learning model for code vulNErability deTection, called MAGNET. MAGNET constructs a multi-granularity meta-path graph for each code snippet, in which the heterogeneous relations are denoted as meta-paths to represent the structural information. A meta-path based hierarchical attentional graph neural network is also proposed to capture the relations between distant nodes in the graph. We evaluate MAGNET on three public datasets and the results show that MAGNET outperforms the best baseline method in terms of F1 score by 6.32%, 21.50%, and 25.40%, respectively. MAGNET also achieves the best performance among all the baseline methods in detecting Top-25 most dangerous Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs), further demonstrating its effectiveness in vulnerability detection.",

However, the deep learning methods require sufficient labeled samples to improve performance, which is unfeasible in practice. The training labels are usually limited in HSIs that need to be classified (namely target domain), while other available labels in multisource HSIs (namely source domain) are not utilized effectively. To mitigate these issues, an attention multisource fusion method of few-shot learning (AMF-FSL) is proposed for small-sized HSI classification. AMF-FSL is an implementation of few-shot learning (FSL) in the meta-learning field, which can transfer the learned ability of classification from multiple source data to target data. The process of learning to classify in AMF-FSL is not restricted by the traditional requirement of the same distribution between the source and target domains, which can learn from the source domain and apply it to a different distribution in the target domain. Moreover, the multisource domain adaption in AMF-FSL has the capacity of extracting features from fused homogeneous and heterogeneous data in the source domain, which can improve the generalization of the classification model in the cross domains. Specifically, the multisource domain adaption contains three modules, namely the target-based class alignment, domain attention assignment, and multisource data fusion, which are responsible for aligning the class space, paying band-level attention, and merging the distributions of homogeneous and heterogeneous data in the source domain. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the multisource domain adaption and the superiority of AMF-FSL over other state-of-the-art methods in small-sized HSI classification.",

Meta-learning aims to solve this problem by training a model on a large number of few-shot tasks, with an objective to learn new tasks quickly from a small number of examples. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning framework for few-shot word sense disambiguation (WSD), where the goal is to learn to disambiguate unseen words from only a few labeled instances. Meta-learning approaches have so far been typically tested in an N-way, K-shot classification setting where each task has N classes with K examples per class. Owing to its nature, WSD deviates from this controlled setup and requires the models to handle a large number of highly unbalanced classes. We extend several popular meta-learning approaches to this scenario, and analyze their strengths and weaknesses in this new challenging setting.",

Here we show that the Baldwin effect is capable of evolving few-shot supervised and reinforcement learning mechanisms, by shaping the hyperparameters and the initial parameters of deep learning algorithms. Furthermore it can genetically accommodate strong learning biases on the same set of problems as a recent machine learning algorithm called MAML \"Model Agnostic Meta-Learning\" which uses second-order gradients instead of evolution to learn a set of reference parameters (initial weights) that can allow rapid adaptation to tasks sampled from a distribution. Whilst in simple cases MAML is more data efficient than the Baldwin effect, the Baldwin effect is more general in that it does not require gradients to be backpropagated to the reference parameters or hyperparameters, and permits effectively any number of gradient updates in the inner loop. The Baldwin effect learns strong learning dependent biases, rather than purely genetically accommodating fixed behaviours in a learning independent manner.",

        "abstract": "In the last 20 years, terrorism has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths and massive economic, political, and humanitarian crises in several regions of the world. Using real-world data on attacks occurred in Afghanistan and Iraq from 2001 to 2018, we propose the use of temporal meta-graphs and deep learning to forecast future terrorist targets. Focusing on three event dimensions, i.e., employed weapons, deployed tactics and chosen targets, meta-graphs map the connections among temporally close attacks, capturing their operational similarities and dependencies. From these temporal meta-graphs, we derive 2-day-based time series that measure the centrality of each feature within each dimension over time. Formulating the problem in the context of the strategic behavior of terrorist actors, these multivariate temporal sequences are then utilized to learn what target types are at the highest risk of being chosen. The paper makes two contributions. First, it demonstrates that engineering the feature space via temporal meta-graphs produces richer knowledge than shallow time-series that only rely on frequency of feature occurrences. Second, the performed experiments reveal that bi-directional LSTM networks achieve superior forecasting performance compared to other algorithms, calling for future research aiming at fully discovering the potential of artificial intelligence to counter terrorist violence.",

Some existing DML methods propose adaptive sample mining strategies, which learn to weight the samples, leading to interesting performance. However, these methods suffer from a small memory (e.g., one training batch), limiting their efficacy. In this work, we introduce a data-driven method, meta-mining strategy with semiglobal information (MMSI), to apply meta-learning to learn to weight samples during the whole training, leading to an adaptive mining strategy. To introduce richer information than one training batch only, we elaborately take advantage of the validation set of meta-learning by implicitly adding additional validation sample information to training. Furthermore, motivated by the latest self-supervised learning, we introduce a dictionary (memory) that maintains very large and diverse information. Together with the validation set, this dictionary presents much richer information to the training, leading to promising performance. In addition, we propose a new theoretical framework that can formulate pairwise and tripletwise metric learning loss functions in a unified framework. This framework brings new insights to society and facilitates us to generalize our MMSI to many existing DML methods. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets, CUB200-2011, Cars-196, and Stanford Online Products (SOP). Results show that our method can achieve the state of the art or very competitive performance.

The most important and challenging problem here is to design an effective and robust diagnosis model. To this end, there are three challenges to overcome: (1) The lack of training samples limits the success of existing deep\u2010learning\u2010based methods. (2) Many public COVID\u201019 data sets contain only a few images without fine\u2010grained labels. (3) Due to the explosive growth of suspected cases, it is urgent and important to diagnose not only COVID\u201019 cases but also the cases of other types of pneumonia that are similar to the symptoms of COVID\u201019. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called Unsupervised Meta\u2010Learning with Self\u2010Knowledge Distillation to address the problem of differentiating COVID\u201019 from pneumonia cases. During training, our model cannot use any true labels and aims to gain the ability of learning to learn by itself. In particular, we first present a deep diagnosis model based on a relation network to capture and memorize the relation among different images. Second, to enhance the performance of our model, we design a self\u2010knowledge distillation mechanism that distills knowledge within our model itself. Our network is divided into several parts, and the knowledge in the deeper parts is squeezed into the shallow ones. The final results are derived from our model by learning to compare the features of images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly higher performance than other state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art methods. Moreover, we construct a new COVID\u201019 pneumonia data set based on text mining, consisting of 2696 COVID\u201019 images (347 X\u2010ray\u2009+\u20092349 CT), 10,155 images (9661 X\u2010ray\u2009+\u2009494 CT) about other types of pneumonia, and the fine\u2010grained labels of all.

The rapid growth in the size of CNs leads to more difficulties in the analysis of CNs tasks. Community Detection (CD) is an important multidisciplinary research area where many machine/deep learning-based methods have been applied to map CNs into a low-dimensional representation for extracting information similarity among members of CNs. Currently, Deep Learning (DL) is one of the promising methods to extract knowledge and learn information from high dimensional space and represent it in low dimensional space. However, designing an accurate and efficient DL-based CD method especially when dealing with large CNs is always an on-going research endeavor to pursue. Meta-Heuristic (MH) algorithms have shown their potentials in improving DL models in terms of solution quality and computational cost. In addition, parallel computing is a feasible solution for building efficient DL models. The algorithmic principle of MH is parallel in nature; however, its computation framework in DL training that is reported in the literature is not really implemented in a parallel computing setup. In this paper, we present a systematic review of CD in CNs from conventional machine learning to DL methods and point out the gap of applying DL-based CD methods in large CNs. In addition, the relevant studies on DL with parallel and MH approaches are reviewed and their implications on DL models are highlighted to prospect effective solutions to overcome the challenges of DL-based CD methods. We also point out research challenges in the field of CD and suggest possible future research directions.",

In classical artificial intelligence approaches, we frequently encounter deep learning methods available today. These deep learning methods can yield highly effective results according to the data set size, data set quality, the methods used in feature extraction, the hyper parameter set used in deep learning models, the activation functions, and the optimization algorithms. However, there are important shortcomings that current deep learning models are currently inadequate. These artificial neural network-based models are black box models that generalize the data transmitted to it and learn from the data. Therefore, the relational link between input and output is not observable. This is an important open point in artificial neural networks and deep learning models. For these reasons, it is necessary to make serious efforts on the explainability and interpretability of black box models.",

In this article, we propose a meta-learning optimization model based on the meta-learner LSTM in the field of regression prediction of PCPMWF. In meta-learning, LSTM is used to replace MAML\u2019s gradient descent optimizer for regression tasks, enables the meta-learner to learn the update rules of the LSTM, and apply it to update the parameters of the model. The proposed method is compared with the experimental results of MAML and LSTM to verify the feasibility and correctness. The average absolute percentage error of the meta-learning optimization model of meta-learner LSTM is reduced by 0.37% compared with the MAML model, and by 4.16% compared with the LSTM model. The loss value of the meta-learning optimization model in the iterative process drops the fastest and steadily compared to the MAML model and the LSTM model. In cross-domain experiments, the average accuracy of the meta-learning optimized model can still reach 0.833. In the case of few sample, the proposed model is superior to the traditional LSTM model and the basic MAML model. And in the training of cross-domain datasets, this model performs best.",

To tackle the challenges in small-sample POP, we propose an approach named Adaptation and Learning to Learn (ALL) by adopting the capability of advanced deep learning and federated learning. ALL integrates two novel ideas: (1) Adaptation: by leveraging the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) reinforcement learning technique, an auto-selector module is implemented, which can group and select data-scarce parks automatically as supporting sources to enable the knowledge adaptation in model training; and (2) Learning to learn: by applying federated meta-learning on selected supporting sources, a meta-learner module is designed, which can train a high-performance local prediction model in a collaborative and privacy-preserving manner. Results of an evaluation with 42 parking lots in two Chinese cities (Shenzhen and Guangzhou) show that, compared to state-of-the-art baselines: (1) the auto-selector can reduce the model variance by about 17.8%; (2) the meta-learner can train a converged model 102\u00d7 faster; and (3) finally, ALL can boost the forecasting performance by about 29.8%.

        "abstract": "Network slicing remains one of the key technologies in 5G and beyond 5G networks (B5G). By leveraging SDN and NVF techniques, it enables the coexistence of several heterogeneous virtual networks (VNs) on top of the same physical infrastructure. Despite the advantages it brings to network operators, network slicing raises a major challenge: Resource allocation of VNs, also known as the virtual network embedding problem (VNEP). VNEP is known to be an NP-Hard problem. Several heuristics, meta-heuristics and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based solutions were proposed in the literature to solve it. Regarding the first two categories, they can provide a solution for large scale problems within a reasonable time, but the solution is usually suboptimal, which leads to an inefficient utilization of the resources and increases the cost of the allocation process. For DRL-based approaches and due to the exploration-exploitation dilemma, the solution can be infeasible. To overcome these issues, we combine, in this work, deep reinforcement learning and relational graph convolutional neural networks in order to automatically learn how to improve the quality of VNEP heuristics. Simulation results show the effectiveness of our approach. Starting with an initial solution given by the heuristics our approach can find an amelioration, with an improvement in the order of 35%.",

We propose a novel approach to lifelong learning of language tasks based on meta-learning with sparse experience replay that directly optimizes to prevent forgetting. We show that under the realistic setting of performing a single pass on a stream of tasks and without any task identifiers, our method obtains state-of-the-art results on lifelong text classification and relation extraction.

Models which optimize these two objectives simultaneously within a single network (joint models) have proven themselves to be superior to mono-objective networks. However, these data-intensive deep learning approaches have not been successful in catering the demand of the industry for adaptable, multilingual dialogue systems. To this end, we cast joint intent detection as an n-way k-shot classification problem and establish it within meta learning setup. Our approach is motivated by the success of meta learning on few-shot image classification tasks. We empirically demonstrate that, our approach can meta-learn a prior from similar tasks under highly resource constrained settings which enable rapid inference on target tasks. First, we show the adaptability of proposed approach by meta learning n-way k-shot joint intent detection using set of intents and evaluating on a completely new set of intents. Second, we exemplify the cross-lingual adaptability by learning a prior, utilizing English utterances and evaluating on Spanish and Thai utterances. Compared to random initialization, our method significantly improves the accuracy in both intent detection and slot-filling.",

When data is scarce for a target task, we can transfer the knowledge gained by training on similar tasks to quickly learn the target. A successful approach is meta-learning, or learning to learn a distribution of tasks, where learning is represented by an outer loop, and to learn by an inner loop of gradient descent. However, a number of recent empirical studies argue that the inner loop is unnecessary and more simple models work equally well or even better. We study the performance of MAML as a function of the learning rate of the inner loop, where zero learning rate implies that there is no inner loop. Using random matrix theory and exact solutions of linear models, we calculate an algebraic expression for the test loss of MAML applied to mixed linear regression and nonlinear regression with overparameterized models. Surprisingly, while the optimal learning rate for adaptation is positive, we find that the optimal learning rate for training is always negative, a setting that has never been considered before. Therefore, not only does the performance increase by decreasing the learning rate to zero, as suggested by recent work, but it can be increased even further by decreasing the learning rate to negative values. These results help clarify under what circumstances meta-learning performs best.",

This ability is limited in the current deep neural networks by a problem called catastrophic forgetting, where training on new tasks tends to severely degrade performance on previous tasks. One way to lessen the impact of the forgetting problem is to constrain parameters that are important to previous tasks to stay close to the optimal parameters. Recently, multiple competitive approaches for computing the importance of the parameters with respect to the previous tasks have been presented. In this paper, we propose a learning to optimize algorithm for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Instead of trying to formulate a new constraint function ourselves, we propose to train another neural network to predict parameter update steps that respect the importance of parameters to the previous tasks. In the proposed meta-training scheme, the update predictor is trained to minimize loss on a combination of current and past tasks. We show experimentally that the proposed approach works in the continual learning setting.",

Therefore, it is important to make use of information across time series to improve learning. In this paper, we will explore the idea of using meta-learning for quickly adapting model parameters to new short-history time series by modifying the original idea of Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) \\cite{finn2017model}. Moreover, based on prior work on multimodal MAML \\cite{vuorio2019multimodal}, we propose a method for conditioning parameters of the model through an auxiliary network that encodes global information of the time series to extract meta-features. Finally, we apply the data to time series of different domains, such as pollution measurements, heart-rate sensors, and electrical battery data.

However, the CSI fingerprints and the DL models trained on such fingerprints are highly dependent on a particular propagation environment, which generally limits the transfer of knowledge of the DL models from one environment to another. In this paper, we propose a DL model consisting of two parts: the first part aims to learn environment independent features while the second part combines those features depending on the particular environment. To improve transfer learning, we propose a meta learning scheme for training the first part over multiple environments. We show that for positioning in a new environment, initializing a DL model with the meta learned environment independent function achieves higher UE positioning accuracy compared to regular transfer learning from one environment to the new environment, or compared to training the DL model from scratch with only fingerprints from the new environment. Our proposed scheme is able to create an environment independent function which can embed knowledge from multiple environments and more effectively learn from a new environment.",

        "abstract": "Systems for learning parameters often have meta-parameters such as step sizes, initial weights, or dimensional weightings. With a given setting of the meta-parameters, the learning system is complete and capable of finding parameters that are suited to the task, but its efficiency typically depends on the particular choice of metaparameters. This has led to interest in learning processes that can find good choices for meta-parameters automatically from experience. These higher-level learning methods are often characterized as \u201clearning to learn\u201d or, as we shall call them here, metalearning. Meta-learning has been explored extensively within machine learning for many years (e.g., see Thrun & Pratt 1998). A class of meta-learning methods that appears particularly powerful and that has attracted considerable recent attention are those based on stochastic gradient descent or ascent (e.g., Andrychowicz et al. 2016; Finn, Abeel & Levine 2017; Xu, van Hasselt & Silver 2018). The rise of deep learning has shown that gradient methods can be surprisingly effective in the base learning system (e.g., AlphaZero (Silver et al. 2018), DeepStack (Morav\u010d\u0301\u0131k et al. 2017), Alexnet (Krizhevsky et al. 2012)), so it is natural to consider gradient methods for learning meta-parameters. Let us call such gradient methods for meta-learning meta-gradient methods, after Xu et al. (2018). Almost all meta-gradient methods use a gradient method in the base learning system as well. Meta-gradient methods have shown promise; they are very general and, in some cases, have achieved learning performance equal to that for hand-tuned meta-parameters. Let us briefly consider the origins of meta-gradient learning methods and the major steps leading to recent developments. The meta-parameter learned in all of the earliest meta-gradient methods was the step size or \u201clearning rate\u201d of supervised learning systems. To our knowledge the first meta-gradient method was a method for setting the step-size (gain) meta-parameter",

        "abstract": "Continuous learning occurs naturally in human beings. However, Deep Learning methods suffer from a problem known as Catastrophic Forgetting (CF) that consists of a model drastically decreasing its performance on previously learned tasks when it is sequentially trained on new tasks. This situation, known as task interference, occurs when a network modifies relevant weight values as it learns a new task. In this work, we propose two main strategies to face the problem of task interference in convolutional neural networks. First, we use a sparse coding technique to adaptively allocate model capacity to different tasks avoiding interference between them. Specifically, we use a strategy based on group sparse regularization to specialize groups of parameters to learn each task. Afterward, by adding binary masks, we can freeze these groups of parameters, using the rest of the network to learn new tasks. Second, we use a meta learning technique to foster knowledge transfer among tasks, encouraging weight reusability instead of overwriting. Specifically, we use an optimization strategy based on episodic training to foster learning weights that are expected to be useful to solve future tasks. Together, these two strategies help us to avoid interference by preserving compatibility with previous and future weight values. Using this approach, we achieve state-of-the-art results on popular benchmarks used to test techniques to avoid CF. In particular, we conduct an ablation study to identify the contribution of each component of the proposed method, demonstrating its ability to avoid retroactive interference with previous tasks and to promote knowledge transfer to future tasks.",

However, deep learning models are notorious for being data and computation hungry. These downsides limit the application of such models from deployment to different domains, languages, countries, or styles, since collecting in-genre data and model training from scratch are costly. The long-tail nature of human language makes challenges even more significant. Meta-learning, or \u2018Learning to Learn\u2019, aims to learn better learning algorithms, including better parameter initialization, optimization strategy, network architecture, distance metrics, and beyond. Meta-learning has been shown to allow faster fine-tuning, converge to better performance, and achieve amazing results for few-shot learning in many applications. Meta-learning is one of the most important new techniques in machine learning in recent years. There is a related tutorial in ICML 2019 and a related course at Stanford, but most of the example applications given in these materials are about image processing. It is believed that meta-learning has great potential to be applied in NLP, and some works have been proposed with notable achievements in several relevant problems, e.g., relation extraction, machine translation, and dialogue generation and state tracking. However, it does not catch the same level of attention as in the image processing community. In the tutorial, we will first introduce Meta-learning approaches and the theory behind them, and then review the works of applying this technology to NLP problems. This tutorial intends to facilitate researchers in the NLP community to understand this new technology better and promote more research studies using this new technology.",

Moreover, it may be a great tool for protecting children from accessing inappropriate content and help parents make a better informed decision about what their kids should watch. However, this is a challenging problem since the very definition of violence is broad and highly subjective. Hence, detecting such nuances from videos with no human supervision is not only technical, but also a conceptual problem. With this in mind, we explore how to better describe the idea of violence for a convolutional neural network by breaking it into more objective and concrete parts. Initially, our method uses independent networks to learn features for more specific concepts related to violence, such as fights, explosions, blood, etc. Then we use these features to classify each concept and later fuse them in a meta-classification to describe violence. We also explore how to represent time-based events in still-images as network inputs; since many violent acts are described in terms of movement. We show that using more specific concepts is an intuitive and effective solution, besides being complementary to form a more robust definition of violence. When compared to other methods for violence detection, this approach holds better classification quality while using only automatic features.",

Retraining a network from scratch to combat this issue poses a significant cost. Meta-learning aims to deliver an adaptive model that is sensitive to these underlying distribution changes, but requires many tasks during the meta-training process. In this paper, we propose a tAsk-auGmented actIve meta-LEarning (AGILE) method to efficiently adapt DNNs to new tasks by using a small number of training examples. AGILE combines a meta-learning algorithm with a novel task augmentation technique which we use to generate an initial adaptive model. It then uses Bayesian dropout uncertainty estimates to actively select the most difficult samples when updating the model to a new task. This allows AGILE to learn with fewer tasks and a few informative samples, achieving high performance with a limited dataset. We perform our experiments using the brain cell classification task and compare the results to a plain meta-learning model trained from scratch. We show that the proposed task-augmented meta-learning framework can learn to classify new cell types after a single gradient step with a limited number of training samples. We show that active learning with Bayesian uncertainty can further improve the performance when the number of training samples is extremely small. Using only 1% of the training data and a single update step, we achieved 90% accuracy on the new cell type classification task, a 50% points improvement over a state-of-the-art meta-learning algorithm.",

In this article, we propose a novel deep meta-learning based mobile traffic prediction framework, namely, dmTP, which can adaptively learn to learn the proper prediction model for each distinct prediction task from accumulated meta-knowledge of previously learned prediction tasks. In dmTP, we regard each mobile traffic prediction task as a base-task and adopt an LSTM network with a fixed structure as the base-learner for each base-task. In order to improve the base-learner's prediction accuracy and learning efficiency, we further employ an MLP as the meta-learner to find the optimal hyper-parameter value and initial training status for the base-learner of a new base-task according to its meta-features. Extensive experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate that while guaranteeing a similar or even better prediction accuracy, meta-learning in the proposed dmTP reduces the numbers of epochs and base-samples needed to train the base-learners by around 75 percent and 81 percent, respectively, as compared with the existing prediction models.",

So far, our understanding of the learning behavior of DNNs trained by noisy segmentation labels remains limited. In this study, we address this deficiency in both binary segmentation of biological microscopy images and multi-class segmentation of natural images. We generate extremely noisy labels by randomly sampling a small fraction (e.g., 10%) or flipping a large fraction (e.g., 90%) of the ground truth labels. When trained with these noisy labels, DNNs provide largely the same segmentation performance as trained by the original ground truth. This indicates that DNNs learn structures hidden in labels rather than pixel-level labels per se in their supervised training for semantic segmentation. We refer to these hidden structures in labels as meta-structures. When DNNs are trained by labels with different perturbations to the meta-structure, we find consistent degradation in their segmentation performance. In contrast, incorporation of meta-structure information substantially improves performance of an unsupervised segmentation model developed for binary semantic segmentation. We define meta-structures mathematically as spatial density distributions and show both theoretically and experimentally how this formulation explains key observed learning behavior of DNNs.",

However, a meta-learning problem known as a low-shot image recognition task occurs when a few images with annotations are available for learning a recognition model for a single category. Consequently, the objects in testing/query and training/support image datasets are likely to vary in terms of size, location, style, and so on. In this paper, we propose a method, cascaded feature matching network (CFMN), to solve this problem. We train the meta-learner to learn a more fine-grained and adaptive deep distance metric using feature matching block, which aligns associated features together and naturally ignores non-discriminative features. By applying the proposed feature matching block in different layers of the network, multi-scale information among the compared images is incorporated into the final cascaded matching feature, which boosts the recognition performance and generalizes better by learning on relationships. Moreover, the experiments for few-shot learning (FSL) using two standard datasets: miniImageNet and Omniglot, confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method. Besides, the multi-label few-shot task is first studied on a new data split of the COCO dataset, which further shows the superiority of the proposed feature matching network when performing the FSL in complex images.",

We address this problem by considering the task of video object segmentation. Previous accurate methods for this task finetune a model using the first annotated frame, and/or use additional inputs such as optical flow and complex post-processing. In contrast, we develop a fast, causal algorithm that requires no finetuning, auxiliary inputs or post-processing, and segments a variable number of objects in a single forward-pass. We represent an object with clusters, or \"visual words\", in the embedding space, which correspond to object parts in the image space. This allows us to robustly match to the reference objects throughout the video, because although the global appearance of an object changes as it undergoes occlusions and deformations, the appearance of more local parts may stay consistent. We learn these visual words in an unsupervised manner, using meta-learning to ensure that our training objective matches our inference procedure. We achieve comparable accuracy to finetuning based methods (whilst being 1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster), and state-of-the-art in terms of speed/accuracy trade-offs on four video segmentation datasets.

Specifically, a global basic critic, meta critic, and task specified network are shared within a distribution of tasks and are capable of criticizing any actor trying to solve any specified task. The hierarchical framework is applied to a critic network in the actor-critic algorithm for distilling meta-knowledge above the task level and addressing distinct tasks.

Deep learning has been successfully extended to meta-learning, where previous solving efforts assist in learning how to optimise future optimisation instances. In recent years, learning to optimise approaches have shown success in solving TSP problems. However, they focus on one type of TSP problem, namely ones where the points are uniformly distributed in Euclidean spaces and have issues in generalising to other embedding spaces, e.g., spherical distance spaces, and to TSP instances where the points are distributed in a non-uniform manner. An aim of learning to optimise is to train once and solve across a broad spectrum of (TSP) problems. Although supervised learning approaches have shown to achieve more optimal solutions than unsupervised approaches, they do require the generation of training data and running a solver to obtain solutions to learn from, which can be time-consuming and difficult to find reasonable solutions for harder TSP instances. Hence this paper introduces a new learning-based approach to solve a variety of different and common TSP problems that are trained on easier instances which are faster to train and are easier to obtain better solutions. We name this approach the non-Euclidean TSP network (NETSP-Net). The approach is evaluated on various TSP instances using the benchmark TSPLIB dataset and popular instance generator used in the literature. We performed extensive experiments that indicate our approach generalises across many types of instances and scales to instances that are larger than what was used during training.",

Since Hebb\u2019s hypothesis [10] that cells that fire together strengthen their connections, cellular studies [6] have shed light on potential synaptic mechanisms underlying learning. These mechanisms have directly driven the careful hand design of biologically plausible models of learning and memory in computational neuroscience [1]. However, these hand designed rules have yet to achieve satisfying success training large neural networks, and are dramatically outperformed by biologically implausible approaches such as backprop. We propose an alternative paradigm for designing biologically plausible learning rules: using meta-learning to learn a parametric synaptic update rule which is capable of training deep networks. We demonstrate this approach by meta-learning an update rule for semi-supervised tasks, where sparse labels are provided to a deep network but the majority of inputs are unlabeled. The meta-learned plasticity rule integrates bottom-up, top-down, and recurrent inputs to each neuron, and generates weight updates as the product of pre- and post- synaptic neuronal outputs. The way in which the inputs to each neuron are combined to produce a learning signal, however, is itself a meta-learned function, parameterized by a neural network. Critically, the meta-learned update rule integrates only neuron-local information when proposing updates\u2013that is, our learning rule is spatially localized to individual neurons. After meta-learning, the resulting synaptic update rule is capable of driving task-relevant learning for semi-supervised tasks. We demonstrate this capability on two simple classification problems. In general, we believe meta-learning to be a powerful approach to finding more effective synaptic plasticity rules, which will motivate new hypotheses for biological neural networks, and new algorithms for artificial neural networks.",

        "abstract": "Both complex and evolving nature of time series structure make forecasting among one of the most important and challenging tasks in time series analysis. Typical methods for forecasting are designed to model time-evolving dependencies between data observations. However, it is generally accepted that none of them is universally valid for every application. Therefore, methods for learning heterogeneous ensembles by combining a diverse set of forecasts together appear as a promising solution to tackle this task. Several approaches, ranging from simple and enhanced averaging tactics to applying meta-learning methods, have been proposed to learn how to combine individual models in an ensemble. However, finding the optimal strategy for ensemble aggregation remains an open research question, particularly, when the ensemble needs to be adapted in real time. In this paper, we leverage a deep reinforcement learning framework for learning linearly weighted ensembles as a meta-learning method. In this framework, the combination policy in ensembles is modelled as a sequential decision making process, and an actor-critic model aims at learning the optimal weights in a continuous action space. The policy is updated following a drift detection mechanism for tracking performance shifts of the ensemble model. An extensive empirical study on many real-world datasets demonstrates that our method achieves excellent or on par results in comparison to the state-of-the-art approaches as well as several baselines.",

In this paper, we extend the MAML algorithm to point cloud data using a PointNet Architecture. We construct N$\\times$K-shot classification tasks from the ModelNet40 point cloud dataset to show that this method performs classification as well as supervised deep learning methods with the added benefit of being able to adapt after a single gradient step on a single N$\\times$K task. We empirically search for optimal values of N and K for few shot classification and show our method to achieve 90% meta test accuracy compared to traditional PointNet with 89.2%. We also adapt a meta-trained PointNet to a support set of 9, N=3, K=3, never before seen point clouds which are drawn from an entirely different dataset, ShapeNet. Once adapted the model achieves 7.1/9 classification accuracy on average across 100 query sets of the same classes with new, unique instances. This result far exceeds the supervised Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) training result of 3.1/9 accuracy on the query sets which is equivalent to a random baseline.",

Meta-RL is most commonly studied in a problem setting where, given a distribution of tasks, the goal is to learn a policy that is capable of adapting to any new task from the task distribution with as little data as possible. In this survey, we describe the meta-RL problem setting in detail as well as its major variations. We discuss how, at a high level, meta-RL research can be clustered based on the presence of a task distribution and the learning budget available for each individual task.

        "abstract": "Equipping a deep model the ability of few-shot learning (FSL) is a core challenge for artificial intelligence. Gradient-based meta-learning effectively addresses the challenge by learning how to learn novel tasks. Its key idea is learning a deep model in a bi-level optimization manner, where the outer-loop process learns a shared gradient descent algorithm (called meta-optimizer), while the inner-loop process leverages it to optimize a task-specific base learner with few examples. Although these methods have shown superior performance on FSL, the outer-loop process requires calculating second-order derivatives along the inner-loop path, which imposes considerable memory burdens and the risk of vanishing gradients. This degrades meta-learning performance. Inspired by recent diffusion models, we find that the inner-loop gradient descent process can be viewed as a reverse process (i.e., denoising) of diffusion where the target of denoising is the weight of base learner but origin data. Based on this fact, we propose to model the gradient descent algorithm as a diffusion model and then present a novel conditional diffusion-based meta-learning, called MetaDiff, that effectively models the optimization process of base learner weights from Gaussian initialization to target weights in a denoising manner. Thanks to the training efficiency of diffusion models, our MetaDiff does not need to differentiate through the inner-loop path such that the memory burdens and the risk of vanishing gradients can be effectively alleviated for improving FSL. Experimental results show that our MetaDiff outperforms state-of-the-art gradient-based meta-learning family on FSL tasks.",

Despite their effectiveness with large amounts of data and computational power, DNNs struggle with distributional shifts and limited labeled data, leading to overfitting and poor generalization across various tasks and domains. Meta-learning presents a promising approach by employing algorithms that acquire transferable knowledge across various tasks for fast adaptation, eliminating the need to learn each task from scratch. This survey paper delves into the realm of meta-learning with a focus on its contribution to domain generalization. We first clarify the concept of meta-learning for domain generalization and introduce a novel taxonomy based on the feature extraction strategy and the classifier learning methodology, offering a granular view of methodologies. Additionally, we present a decision graph to assist readers in navigating the taxonomy based on data availability and domain shifts, enabling them to select and develop a proper model tailored to their specific problem requirements.

However, most existing AMC methods assume sufficient labeled signals and invariant signal distribution, which is often impossible in untrusted environments. In this article, a new meta-learning method is proposed for a few-shot AMC with distribution bias. First, a multi-frequency octave ResNet (MFOR) is constructed to learn coarse (low-frequency) and fine (high-frequency) features, which can efficiently identify the modulation type of the signal while saving computational resources. Second, a large number of classification-related meta-tasks are established for training MFOR to explore general knowledge in signal classification, and then transfer it to the AMC. Different with deep neural networks (DNNs) that learn a mapping by multiple instances, the MFOR with meta-learning (denoted as M-MFOR) can improve the generalization ability of new AMC tasks with very few instances and distribution bias. Furthermore, we find that the distribution bias between data can be reduced by adjusting the normalized distribution and propose a class-related mixup. Extensive experiments are taken on several datasets to investigate the effectiveness of M-MFOR. The results show its feasibility and superiority over existing methods.",

Therefore, bearing fault diagnosis problems under practical working conditions are often considered few-shot problems. Meta-learning can be adopted to solve these few-shot problems. Traditional meta-learning methods, however, can lead to model overfitting, and shallow neural networks are usually used to avoid overfitting. As a result, the features extracted by the shallow neural network are insufficiently rich to exploit the optimal performance of the model. A few-shot fault diagnosis method based on meta-learning, named meta-transfer learning with freezing operation (MTLFO), is proposed in this study to solve these problems. MTLFO can learn new knowledge rapidly through a small number of samples. The hyperparameter self-regulation ability of meta-learning is adopted by MTLFO, and a freezing operation is used to deal with the neuronal nature of meta-learning to ensure that the neurons from different tasks are transferred by utilizing scaling and shifting. MTLFO avoids the overfitting problem in traditional meta-learning methods and presents more advantages in solving few-shot problems in fault diagnosis compared with other types of methods.",

In this paper, we propose crucial steps towards making such ideas scalable: Firstly, we employ state-of-the-art network sparsification techniques to drastically improve compression. Secondly, introduce the first method allowing for sparsification to be employed in the inner-loop of commonly used Meta-Learning algorithms, drastically improving both compression and the computational cost of learning INRs. The generality of this formalism allows us to present results on diverse data modalities such as images, manifolds, signed distance functions, 3D shapes and scenes, several of which establish new state-of-the-art results.",

Expanding upon this accomplishment, there has been a surge in research exploring the application of neural networks in other learning scenarios. One notable framework that has garnered significant attention is meta-learning. Often described as \u201clearning to learn,\u201d meta-learning is a data-driven approach to optimize the learning algorithm. Other branches of interest are continual learning and online learning, both of which involve incrementally updating a model with streaming data. While these frameworks were initially developed independently, recent works have started investigating their combinations, proposing novel problem settings and learning algorithms. However, due to the elevated complexity and lack of unified terminology, discerning differences between the learning frameworks can be challenging even for experienced researchers. To facilitate a clear understanding, this paper provides a comprehensive survey that organizes various problem settings using consistent terminology and formal descriptions. By offering an overview of these learning paradigms, our work aims to foster further advancements in this promising area of research.",

We propose a contrastive learning-based Bayes-adaptive meta-reinforcement learning (CBAMRL) algorithm that addresses these limitations, enabling agents to learn new skills from a few transitions and adapt to the new environment. We first introduce a Bayes-adaptive training strategy, achieving zero-shot adaptation in nonstationary environments with high sample efficiency and competitive asymptotic performance. We proposed a contrastive learning-based contextual encoder to represent complex task distributions with similar structures, providing compact and sufficient task representation without modeling irrelevant dependencies. We evaluate the proposed method on a validated pantograph\u2013catenary system (PCS) benchmark.

        "abstract": "With rapid advancements in depth sensors and deep learning, skeleton-based person re-identification (re-ID) models have recently achieved remarkable progress with many advantages. Most existing solutions learn single-level skeleton features from body joints with the assumption of equal skeleton importance, while they typically lack the ability to exploit more informative skeleton features from various levels such as limb level with more global body patterns. The label dependency of these methods also limits their flexibility in learning more general skeleton representations. This paper proposes a generic unsupervised Hierarchical skeleton Meta-Prototype Contrastive learning (Hi-MPC) approach with Hard Skeleton Mining (HSM) for person re-ID with unlabeled 3D skeletons. Firstly, we construct hierarchical representations of skeletons to model coarse-to-fine body and motion features from the levels of body joints, components, and limbs. Then a hierarchical meta-prototype contrastive learning model is proposed to cluster and contrast the most typical skeleton features (\"prototypes\") from different-level skeletons. By converting original prototypes into meta-prototypes with multiple homogeneous transformations, we induce the model to learn the inherent consistency of prototypes to capture more effective skeleton features for person re-ID. Furthermore, we devise a hard skeleton mining mechanism to adaptively infer the informative importance of each skeleton, so as to focus on harder skeletons to learn more discriminative skeleton representations. Extensive evaluations on five datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms a wide variety of state-of-the-art skeleton-based methods. We further show the general applicability of our method to cross-view person re-ID and RGB-based scenarios with estimated skeletons.",

Model-based control methods are commonly employed to address this problem, but they suffer from issues related to the time-variability of parameters and the inaccuracy of mathematical models. To improve these, a meta-learning and self-adaptation hybrid approach is proposed in this paper to enable an underwater robot to adapt to ocean currents. Instead of using a traditional complex mathematical model, a deep neural network (DNN) serving as the basis function is trained to learn a high-order hydrodynamic model offline; then, a set of linear coefficients is adjusted dynamically by an adaptive law online. By conjoining these two strategies for real-time thrust compensation, the proposed method leverages the potent representational capacity of DNN along with the rapid response of adaptive control. This combination achieves a significant enhancement in tracking performance compared to alternative controllers, as observed in simulations. These findings substantiate that the AUV can adeptly adapt to new speeds of ocean currents.",

Recently, many deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based methods have been proposed to learn the scheduling policy through interacting with the environment. However, most DRL methods focus on a specific environment, which may lead to a weak adaptability to new environments because they have low sample efficiency and require full retraining to learn updated policies for new environments. To overcome the weakness and reduce the time consumption of adapting to new environment, we propose a task scheduling method based on meta reinforcement learning called MRLCC. Through comparing MRLCC and baseline algorithms on the performance of shortening makespan in different environments, we can find that MRLCC is able to adapt to different environments quickly and has a high sample efficiency. Besides, the experimental results demonstrate that MRLCC can maintain a high utilization rate over all baseline algorithms after a few steps of gradient update.",

To address this problem, this article proposes an intrusion detection method feedback semi-supervised learning with meta-gradient for intrusion detection (FSMG) based on feedback deep semi-supervised learning. FSMG constructs a lightweight evaluation network with slight data augmentation and nonprocessing on the same input, respectively, and uses a small amount of labeled data to infer nonidentically distributed data flows hidden in the training dataset. Then, FSMG converts malicious flows into useful information, continuously track and update the model, reducing data labeling errors. Furthermore, for the updating of gradients in the model, a bilevel nested optimization is used to ensure the model converges within $O({\\mathrm{C}}/{\\sqrt{T}})$. Unlike other semisupervised algorithms, FSMG uses labeled data and nonidentically distributed unlabeled data proportionally to construct the training dataset, achieving higher classification accuracy, and better robustness even with an 80% polluted rate.",

Using two publicly available datasets, namely MIRAGE19 (40 classes) and AppClassNet (500 classes), we show that ($i$) by using DL methods on large datasets we can obtain more general representations with (i i) contrastive learning methods yielding the best performance and (iii) meta-learning the worst one.

Our approach integrates Soft Confident Learning, which assigns lower weights to low-confidence samples, and Meta-Learning, which stabilizes training by regularizing updates based on training validation loss covariance. This prevents overfitting and enhances robustness to noisy data. CoMet is model-agnostic and can be applied to any anomaly detection method trainable via gradient descent. Experiments on MVTec-AD, VIADUCT, and KSDD2 with two state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, consistently improving over the baseline methods, remaining insensitive to anomalies in the training set, and setting a new state-of-the-art across all datasets.",

On the other hand, in the more classical literature of statistical machine learning, many models have sequential Bayesian update rules that yield the same learning outcome as the batch training, i.e., they are completely immune to catastrophic forgetting. However, they are often overly simple to model complex real-world data. In this work, we adopt the meta-learning paradigm to combine the strong representational power of neural networks and simple statistical models' robustness to forgetting. In our novel meta-continual learning framework, continual learning takes place only in statistical models via ideal sequential Bayesian update rules, while neural networks are meta-learned to bridge the raw data and the statistical models. Since the neural networks remain fixed during continual learning, they are protected from catastrophic forgetting. This approach not only achieves significantly improved performance but also exhibits excellent scalability. Since our approach is domain-agnostic and model-agnostic, it can be applied to a wide range of problems and easily integrated with existing model architectures.",

Among them, a prototypical network learns a metric space that may be used to compute the distance to the prototype center of speakers, in order to classify speaker identity. We use emphasized channel attention, propagation and aggregation in TDNN (ECAPA-TDNN) to implement the necessary function for the prototypical network, which is a nonlinear mapping from the input space to the metric space for either few-shot SV task. In addition, optimizing only for speakers in given meta-tasks cannot be sufficient to learn distinctive speaker features.

To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective method for HSI classification using model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) and Regularized Fine-tuning (MRFSL). Our method uses optimized 3-D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) model, aided by MAML and cutout data augmentation to enable cross-domain transfer learning and carry out the HSI classification with limited target samples.

        "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) has become a dominating type of workloads on AI computing platforms. The performance of such platforms highly depends on how distributed DL jobs are scheduled. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based schedulers have been extensively studied and are capable of modeling interferences between concurrent jobs competing for resources. However, existing RL-based schedulers must learn from large number of samples and adapt to workload changes in real systems, which is a huge cost for production clusters. This paper proposes an intelligent, autonomous scheduler that employs sample-efficient RL for real-world resource scheduling on complex DL clusters. Specifically, we design a closed-loop meta-RL-based worker placement algorithm for DL training jobs. Instead of random exploration, we encourage the scheduler to explore combinatorial subspaces, where the performance model might be inaccurate, to improve the sampling efficiency of the scheduler agent. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms other baselines in terms of average job completion time with 12.29% to 16.24% improvements. Further experiments with workload variations yield 15.76% to 22.13% improvements.",

        "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complicated neurodevelopment disorder that is becoming more common day by day around the world. The literature that uses machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches gained interest due to their ability to increase the accuracy of diagnosing disorders and reduce the physician\u2019s workload. These artificial intelligence-based applications can learn and detect patterns automatically through the collection of data. ML approaches are used in various applications where the traditional algorithms have failed to obtain better results. The major advantage of the ML algorithm is its ability to produce consistent and better performance predictions with the help of non-linear and complex relationships among the features. In this paper, deep learning with a meta-heuristic (MH) approach is proposed to perform the feature extraction and feature selection processes. The proposed feature selection phase has two sub-phases, such as DL-based feature extraction and MH-based feature selection. The effective convolutional neural network (CNN) model is implemented to extract the core features that will learn the relevant data representation in a lower-dimensional space. The hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm called Seagull-Elephant Herding Optimization Algorithm (SEHOA) is used to select the most relevant and important features from the CNN extracted features. Autism disorder patients are identified using long-term short-term memory as a classifier. This will detect the ASD using the fMRI image dataset ABIDE (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) and obtain promising results. There are five evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and area under the curve (AUC) used. The validated results show that the proposed model performed better, with an accuracy of 98.6%.",

Substitute training makes it possible to conduct black-box substitute attacks in real-world scenarios where the attacker does not need access to the structure, parameters, and training set of the target model. However, existing substitute training methods require a large number of queries on the target model and suffer from low attack success rates. To alleviate these problems, we propose a novel black-box adversarial attack method, named substitute meta-learning (SML), which combines meta-learning with the training of the substitute model. Different from existing substitute training methods that rely on data augmentation tactics or refined loss functions, we aim to boost the learning efficiency of the substitute model to improve training efficiency and attack performance. Specifically, we introduce meta-learning to enable the substitute model to learn the knowledge of the target model using a few queries. Extensive experiments are conducted on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed SML can improve the attack success rate from 46.1% to 61.3% while requiring fewer queries.",

With the rapid development of encryption technology, various new types of encrypted traffic are emerging and difficult to label. Therefore, it is an urgent problem to train a deep learning model using only a small number of samples to detect new classes of malicious encrypted traffic. This paper proposes a few-shot malicious encrypted traffic detection (FMETD) approach based on model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML), integrating feature selection and classification into an end-to-end framework. The FMETD approach first converts the raw traffic data into two-dimensional grayscale images. Then, FMETD trains a deep learning model (2D-CNN) using the MAML, which is to learn an optimal set of model initialization parameters for the model from a set of classification tasks consisting of grayscale images. The model with this set of parameters can detect new classes of maliciously encrypted traffic data efficiently with a few samples by a few iterations steps. The experimental results show that the FMETD approach has 99.8% accuracy for two-class classification encrypted traffic and 98.5% average accuracy for multi-classification. When the number of grayscale images of each class in the support set and validation set is reduced to 20, the accuracy of our approach to multi-class classification is 97.9% for new classes of traffic.",

Few-shot text classification focuses on predicting unknown samples using only a few labeled samples. Recently, metric-based meta-learning methods have achieved promising results in few-shot text classification. They use episodic training in labeled samples to enhance the model\u2019s generalization ability. However, existing models only focus on learning from a few labeled samples but neglect to learn from a large number of unlabeled samples. In this paper, we exploit the knowledge learned by the model in unlabeled samples to improve the generalization performance of the meta-network. Specifically, we introduce a novel knowledge distillation method that expands and enriches the meta-learning representation with self-supervised information. Meanwhile, we design a graph aggregation method that efficiently interacts the query set information with the support set information in each task and outputs a more discriminative representation. We conducted experiments on three public few-shot text classification datasets.

In this work, we propose a general framework that addresses both the long-tail and noisy label issues. Our model is adaptively tailored to the problem domain using a contrastive learning approach. The re-weighting module, a feed-forward network, learns explicit weighting functions and adjusts weights based on metadata. Additionally, our framework modifies the weights of terms in the loss function through a combination of polynomial expansion of the cross-entropy loss and focal loss. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework compared to baseline methods.

        "abstract": "Centralized chiller plants with multiple chillers are typically over-provisioned. Therefore, intelligent scheduling is required for the supply (operating chillers) to efficiently meet the demand (actual cooling load of buildings). Traditional cooling-load based control (CLC) may result in poor part-loaded efficiency. Recent data-driven approaches to chiller control either unrealistically assume perfect knowledge of individual chiller power at various leaving chilled water temperatures (LWTs) or control all chillers with same LWT. We complement existing work with iChill, an end-to-end learning-based intelligent chiller power prediction and scheduling strategy. First, given a dataset of chillers of varying capacities, each of which operates at a fixed LWT and varying loads, iChill meta-learns a model for power prediction. Specifically, for an unseen target chiller, the meta-learned model is re-trained with known LWT to predict power at unseen LWT. Second, given the configuration of a chiller plant and a cooling load profile, iChill learns to schedule individual chillers by jointly deciding the ON/OFF status and LWT; using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We train and evaluate iChill in a simulated environment with real-world data from a chiller plant of 22 chillers. Specifically, we compare iChill's (1) meta-learned power model with regular transfer learning; and (2) DRL scheduling with multiple baselines including CLC and an oracle model-based predictive control (MPC) strategy with perfect knowledge. We find that iChill's (1) meta-learning improves over transfer learning by up to 15.5%; and (2) DRL scheduling saves 11.5% energy over CLC and is comparable with oracle MPC (12% over CLC). Finally, off-line pre-training of iChill's DRL on the meta-learned chiller models reduces the need for real-world training experimentation by 11x from 3 years to 96 days.",

One popular meta-learning approach is model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) which learns tasks by optimizing parameters towards highest generalizability of future tasks. The present paper applied a practical implementation of MAML to conduct an image classification task. Results showed that performance on learning new tasks neared training performance without overfitting. Furthermore, optimal values for inner-loop and outer-loop learning rate were close to default parameter values. Smaller batch sizes with more epochs improved learning in earlier epochs compared to larger batch sizes with fewer epochs.

Despite their remarkable performance, these methods make a prior assumption that the low-resolution video is obtained by down-scaling the high-resolution video using a known degradation kernel, which does not hold in practical settings. Another problem with these methods is that they cannot exploit instance-specific internal information of a video at testing time. Recently, deep internal learning approaches have gained attention due to their ability to utilize the instance-specific statistics of a video. However, these methods have a large inference time as they require thousands of gradient updates to learn the intrinsic structure of the data. In this work, we present Adaptive VideoSuper-Resolution (Ada-VSR) which leverages external, as well as internal, information through meta-transfer learning and internal learning, respectively. Specifically, meta-learning is employed to obtain adaptive parameters, using a large-scale external dataset, that can adapt quickly to the novel condition (degradation model) of the given test video during the internal learning task, thereby exploiting external and internal information of a video for super-resolution. The model trained using our approach can quickly adapt to a specific video condition with only a few gradient updates, which reduces the inference time significantly.

In this work, we propose to learn from the large scale of web images and corresponding tags without any manual annotations along with limited fully annotated datasets. In particular, inspired by the recent success of webly supervised learning in deep neural networks, we capitalize on readily-available web images with noisy annotations to learn a robust representation for masked faces.

        "abstract": "Deep learning models have been successfully applied to polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image terrain classification. However, they usually need many labeled samples from the current PolSAR image to be classified to train the model parameters, which fundamentally limits their application. In this paper, we propose a metric-based meta-learning framework for few-shot terrain classification (MML-FSTC) of PolSAR image. The proposed MML-FSTC firstly utilizes the collected base labeled samples (BLS) from typical PolSAR systems to learn an effective transferable three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3DCNN) to extract features for terrain classification. Then, by mimicking the few-shot learning of human, MML-FSTC integrates additional samples, whose label spaces are probably different from those of BLS, and proposes a meta-learning strategy for terrain classification that consists of multiple few-shot training episodes, each of which has very few labeled terrain samples and potentially different labeled space. By minimizing the cosine distance of the support and query deep features, MML-FSTC finetunes the pre-trained 3DCNN in the meta-learning stage, and utilizes a metric-based cosine distance function to predict the classification. The classification results demonstrate the superiority of MML-FSTC for few-shot PolSAR image terrain classification.",

        "abstract": "Today's deep learning methods focus on how to design the most appropriate objective functions so that the prediction results of the model can be closest to the ground truth. Meanwhile, an appropriate architecture that can facilitate acquisition of enough information for prediction has to be designed. Existing methods ignore a fact that when input data undergoes layer-by-layer feature extraction and spatial transformation, large amount of information will be lost. This paper will delve into the important issues of data loss when data is transmitted through deep networks, namely information bottleneck and reversible functions. We proposed the concept of programmable gradient information (PGI) to cope with the various changes required by deep networks to achieve multiple objectives. PGI can provide complete input information for the target task to calculate objective function, so that reliable gradient information can be obtained to update network weights. In addition, a new lightweight network architecture -- Generalized Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (GELAN), based on gradient path planning is designed. GELAN's architecture confirms that PGI has gained superior results on lightweight models. We verified the proposed GELAN and PGI on MS COCO dataset based object detection. The results show that GELAN only uses conventional convolution operators to achieve better parameter utilization than the state-of-the-art methods developed based on depth-wise convolution. PGI can be used for variety of models from lightweight to large. It can be used to obtain complete information, so that train-from-scratch models can achieve better results than state-of-the-art models pre-trained using large datasets, the comparison results are shown in Figure 1.

        "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has become a promising technology to realize the programmable wireless environment via steering the incident signal in fully customizable ways. However, a major challenge in RIS-aided communication systems is the simultaneous design of the precoding matrix at the base station (BS) and the phase shifting matrix of the RIS elements. This is mainly attributed to the highly non-convex optimization space of variables at both the BS and the RIS, and the diversity of communication environments. Generally, traditional optimization methods for this problem suffer from the high complexity, while existing deep learning based methods are lacking in robustness in various scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce a gradient-based manifold meta learning method (GMML), which works without pre-training and has strong robustness for RIS-aided communications. Specifically, the proposed method fuses meta learning and manifold learning to improve the overall spectral efficiency, and reduce the overhead of the high-dimensional signal process. Unlike traditional deep learning based methods which directly take channel state information as input, GMML feeds the gradients of the precoding matrix and phase shifting matrix into neural networks. Coherently, we design a differential regulator to constrain the phase shifting matrix of the RIS. Numerical results show that the proposed GMML can improve the spectral efficiency by up to 7.31%, and speed up the convergence by 23 times faster compared to traditional approaches. Moreover, they also demonstrate remarkable robustness and adaptability in dynamic settings.",

This research aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the applications of ANN, ML, DL, and EL in addressing forecasting within the field related to geotechnical engineering, including soil mechanics, foundation engineering, rock mechanics, environmental geotechnics, and transportation geotechnics. Previous studies have not collectively examined all four algorithms\u2014ANN, ML, DL, and EL\u2014and have not explored their advantages and disadvantages in the field of geotechnical engineering. This research aims to categorize and address this gap in the existing literature systematically. An extensive dataset of relevant research studies was gathered from the Web of Science and subjected to an analysis based on their approach, primary focus and objectives, year of publication, geographical distribution, and results. Additionally, this study included a co-occurrence keyword analysis that covered ANN, ML, DL, and EL techniques, systematic reviews, geotechnical engineering, and review articles that the data, sourced from the Scopus database through the Elsevier Journal, were then visualized using VOS Viewer for further examination. The results demonstrated that ANN is widely utilized despite the proven potential of ML, DL, and EL methods in geotechnical engineering due to the need for real-world laboratory data that civil and geotechnical engineers often encounter. However, when it comes to predicting behavior in geotechnical scenarios, EL techniques outperform all three other methods. Additionally, the techniques discussed here assist geotechnical engineering in understanding the benefits and disadvantages of ANN, ML, DL, and EL within the geo techniques area. This understanding enables geotechnical practitioners to select the most suitable techniques for creating a certainty and resilient ecosystem.",

We used prototypical networks and model agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithms as meta-learning methods. The breast ultrasound images (BUSI) dataset, which has three classes and is difficult to use in meta-learning, was used for meta-testing in a cross-domain approach along with other datasets for meta-training.

These results represent a significant improvement ranging from 6.27 to 7.10% over the baseline accuracy of 0.831. The results showed that ProtoNet outperformed the MAML method for all k-shot settings. In addition, the use of ResNet models as the backbone network for feature extraction was found to be more successful than the use of a four-layer convolutional model. Our proposed method is the first attempt to apply meta-learning for few-shot classification in the BUSI dataset while providing higher accuracy compared to deep learning methods for medical images with small-scale datasets and few classes.

These memristors operate in a non-filamentary, low conductance regime, which enables stable and energy efficient operation. They can act as multi-functional hardware synapses in a class of bio-inspired deep neural networks (DNN) that make use of both long- and short-term synaptic dynamics and are capable of meta-learning or learning-to-learn. The resulting bio-inspired DNN is then trained to play the video game Atari Pong, a complex reinforcement learning task in a dynamic environment. Our analysis shows that the energy consumption of the DNN with multi-functional memristive synapses decreases by about two orders of magnitude as compared to a pure GPU implementation. Based on this finding, we infer that memristive devices with a better emulation of the synaptic functionalities do not only broaden the applicability of neuromorphic computing, but could also improve the performance and energy costs of certain artificial intelligence applications.",

In this paper, we propose a meta-learning and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based SISR approach to learn kernel priors from organized randomness. In concrete, a lightweight network is adopted as kernel generator, and is optimized via learning from the MCMC simulation on random Gaussian distributions. This procedure provides an approximation for the rational blur kernel, and introduces a network-level Langevin dynamics into SISR optimization processes, which contributes to preventing bad local optimal solutions for kernel estimation. Meanwhile, a meta-learning based alternating optimization procedure is proposed to optimize the kernel generator and image restorer, respectively. In contrast to the conventional alternating minimization strategy, a meta-learning based framework is applied to learn an adaptive optimization strategy, which is less-greedy and results in better convergence performance. These two procedures are iteratively processed in a plug-and-play fashion, for the first time, realizing a learning-based but plug-and-play blind SISR solution in unsupervised inference. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superior performance and generalization ability of the proposed approach when compared with the Start-of-the-Art solutions on synthesis and real-world datasets.",

        "abstract": "Objectives Knee osteoarthritis (KOA), a prevalent degenerative joint disease, is primarily diagnosed through X-ray imaging. The Kellgren-Lawrence grading system (K-L) is the gold standard for evaluating KOA severity through X-ray analysis. However, this method is highly subjective and non-quantifiable, limiting its effectiveness in detecting subtle joint changes on X-rays. Recent researchers have been directed towards developing deep-learning (DL) techniques for a more accurate diagnosis of KOA using X-ray images. Despite advancements in these intelligent methods, the debate over their diagnostic sensitivity continues. Hence, we conducted the current meta-analysis. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, Web of Science, and IEEE up to July 11, 2023. The QUADAS-2 tool was employed to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. Given the multi-classification nature of DL tasks, the sensitivity of DL across different K-L grades was meta-analyzed. Results A total of 19 studies were included, encompassing 62,158 images. These images consisted of 22,388 for K-L0, 13,415 for K-L1, 15,597 for K-L2, 7768 for K-L3, and 2990 for K-L4. The meta-analysis demonstrated that the sensitivity of DL was 86.74% for K-L0 (95% CI: 80.01%\u201392.28%), 64.00% for K-L1 (95% CI: 51.81%\u201375.35%), 75.03% for K-L2 (95% CI: 66.00%\u201383.09%), 84.76% for K-L3 (95% CI: 78.34%\u201390.25%), and 90.32% for K-L4 (95% CI: 85.39%\u201394.40%). Conclusions The DL multi-classification methods based on X-ray imaging generally demonstrate a favorable sensitivity rate (over 50%) in distinguishing between K-L0-K-L4. Specifically, for K-L4, the sensitivity is highly satisfactory at 90.32%. In contrast, the sensitivity rates for K-L1-2 still need improvement. Clinical relevance statement Deep-learning methods have been useful to some extent in assessing the effectiveness of X-rays for osteoarthritis of the knee. However, this requires further research and reliable data to provide specific recommendations for clinical practice. Key Points X-ray deep-learning (DL) methods are debatable for evaluating knee osteoarthritis (KOA) under The Kellgren-Lawrence system (K-L). Multi-classification deep-learning methods are more clinically relevant for assessing K-L grading than dichotomous results. For K-L3 and K-L4, X-ray-based DL has high diagnostic performance; early KOA needs to be further improved.",

It can also reduce regulation mileage payments and achieve multi-objective active fault-tolerant control. In addition, this paper proposes a brain-Inspired deep meta-deterministic policy gradient algorithm (BIMA-DMDPG), which adopts multi-agent centralized training, equates the controller of each area as an agent capable of independent decision making, and implements distributed training by dividing the environment into multiple environments. In addition, meta-reinforcement learning is employed to realize multi-task collaborative learning. The optimal policy is actively selected under different fault conditions to achieve active fault-tolerant control. The superior performance of the method is verified in a four-area LFC model of the China Southern Grid (CSG), in which it is tested alongside a selection of existing algorithms. Note to Practitioners\u2014AFCT-LFC is based on advanced artificial intelligence algorithm, which can effectively identify any fault in multi-area grids and make rapid response to achieve active fault-tolerant control. Compared with the existing model-based fault-tolerant control methods, the BIMA-DMDPG algorithm proposed in this paper does not need to rely on accurate mathematical models, and can be applied to practice through simple training, which is very suitable for practical applications. Therefore, AFCT-LFC is an advanced adaptive active fault-tolerant control method that can be truly applied in practice because of its fast-decision-making ability and performance.",

ISAR images are widely applied in space target observation and classification tasks, whereas, limited to the expensive cost of ISAR sample collection, training deep learning-based ISAR image classifiers with insufficient samples and generating ISAR samples from emulation optical images via image translation techniques have attracted increasing attention. Image translation has highlighted significant success and popularity in computer vision, remote sensing and data generation societies. However, most of the existing methods are implemented under the discipline of extracting the explicit pixel-level features and do not perform effectively while entailing translation to domains with specific implicit features, such as ISAR image does. We propose a meta-learning based domain prior to implicit feature modelling and apply it to CycleGAN and UNIT models to realize effective translations between the ISAR and optical domains. Two representative implicit features, ISAR scattering distribution feature from the physical domain and the classification identifying feature from the task domain, are elaborately formulated with explicit modelling in statistic form. A meta-learning based training scheme is introduced to leverage the mutual knowledge of domain priors across different samples, and thus allows few-shot learning capacity with dramatically reduced training samples. Extensive simulations validate that the obtained ISAR images have better visible-authenticity and training-effectiveness than the existing image translation approaches on various synthetic datasets.

        "abstract": "Large-scale pretraining followed by task-specific finetuning has achieved great success in various NLP tasks. Since finetuning all parameters of large pretrained models poses substantial computational and memory challenges, several efficient finetuning methods have been developed. Among them, low-rank adaptation (LoRA), which finetunes low-rank incremental update matrices on top of frozen pretrained weights, has proven particularly effective. Nonetheless, LoRA\u2019s uniform rank assignment across all layers, along with its reliance on an exhaustive search to find the best rank, leads to high computation costs and suboptimal finetuning performance. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoLoRA, a meta learning based framework for automatically identifying the optimal rank of each LoRA layer. AutoLoRA associates each rank-1 matrix in a low-rank update matrix with a selection variable, which determines whether the rank-1 matrix should be discarded. A meta learning based method is developed to learn these selection variables. The optimal rank is determined by thresholding the values of these variables. Our comprehensive experiments on natural language understanding, generation, and sequence labeling demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoLoRA.

Task offloading allows the migration of complex tasks from user devices to the remote edge-cloud servers thereby reducing their computational burden and energy consumption while also improving the efficiency of task processing. However, obtaining the optimal offloading strategy in a multi-task offloading decision-making process is an NP-hard problem. Existing Deep learning techniques with slow learning rates and weak adaptability are not suitable for dynamic multi-user scenarios. In this article, we propose a novel deep meta-reinforcement learning-based approach to the multi-task offloading problem using a combination of first-order meta-learning and deep Q-learning methods. We establish the meta-generalization bounds for the proposed algorithm and demonstrate that it can reduce the time and energy consumption of IoT applications by up to 15%.

Still, its effectiveness is limited when unknown fault states appear in the target domain. Consequently, open set DG (OSDG) has emerged to identify unknown classes in unknown domains. However, data collection costs and safety concerns have resulted in a significant class imbalance in OSDG. This imbalance causes the decision boundary to be skewed toward abundant positive classes, ultimately leading to misclassifying unknown states and increasing security risks. Currently, there is a lack of methods to simultaneously address domain shift and class shift in an imbalanced unknown domain. To tackle this issue, this article proposes a multisource domain-class gradient coordination meta-learning (MDGCML) framework, which can learn the generalized boundaries of all tasks by coordinating gradients between interdomains and interclasses. Based on the MDGCML, a joint learning paradigm involving the sharing of parameters between open-set classifiers and closed-set classifiers is constructed to enable quick adaption of the model to unknown domains. The superior performance of the proposed framework has been verified on two datasets.",

The existing ABR algorithms require significant tuning and do not generalize to diverse network conditions and personalized QoE objectives. In this article, we propose a novel framework for meta-learning based ABR design and discuss challenges of deploying learning based ABR mechanism in real-world video streaming systems. We utilize the proposed framework to design MetaABR, a novel adaptive bitrate selection algorithm based on meta-reinforcement learning to maximize users\u2019 QoE. By jointly training multiple learning tasks with a shared meta-critic, it can provide transferrable meta-knowledge to supervise bitrate selection across tasks, and can be applied to efficiently learn a new task in unseen environment with only a few trials. We implement MetaABR on an emulation platform which connects to the Linux network protocol stack through virtual network interfaces. Extensive experiments based on real-world traces and wireless testbed show that MetaABR achieves the best comprehensive QoE compared with the state-of-the-art ABR algorithms in a variety of network environments.",

Currently, deep learning (DL) offers a rapid manner to design various metasurfaces. However, conventional DL models are usually assumed as black boxes, which is difficult to explain how a DL model learns physical features, and they usually predict optical responses of metasurfaces in a fuzzy way. This makes them incapable of capturing critical spectral features precisely, such as high quality (Q) resonances, and hinders their use in designing metasurface sensors. Here, a transformer\u2010based explainable DL model named Metaformer for the high\u2010intelligence design, which adopts a spectrum\u2010splitting scheme to elevate 99% prediction accuracy through reducing 99% training parameters, is established. Based on the Metaformer, all\u2010dielectric metasurfaces based on quasi\u2010bound states in the continuum (Q\u2010BIC) for high\u2010performance metasensing are designed, and fabrication experiments are guided potently.

We obtain task-averaged regret bounds for the reward maximization (optimality gap) and constraint violations using gradient-based meta-learning and show that the task-averaged optimality gap and constraint satisfaction improve with task-similarity in a static environment or task-relatedness in a dynamic environment. Several technical challenges arise when making this framework practical.

Recent studies have contributed to remarkable accuracy improvement by developing deep learning methods. However, when they access massive amounts of data and frequently exchange data through the Internet of Things (IoT), data silos and inefficient training emerge as main challenges. To tackle these challenges, this study proposes an integrated approach for regional EV charging demand forecasting, named federated meta learning-based graph convolutional network, which consists of two modules, namely, 1) ST learning module, which introduces spatial and temporal attentions to capture the underlying charging patterns between different regions and cities effectively and 2) distributed pretraining module, which incorporates federated learning and meta-learning to enhance the adaptivity and generalisability of the forecasting model. A comprehensive evaluation based on a real-world data set of 25246 public EV charging piles shows that the proposed model outperforms other representative models with 1) an average improvement of 29.9% in forecasting errors; 2) an acceleration of 65% in convergence speed; and 3) a sound adaptability to support varying charging demand.",

        "abstract": "Automatic modulation classification (AMC) has a wide range of applications in both civilian and military fields, such as industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) security, communication spectrum management, and military electronic countermeasures. However, label mislabeling often occurs in practical scenarios, significantly impacting the performance and robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs). In this article, we propose a meta-learning guided label noise distillation method to enhance the robustness of AMC models against label noise or errors. Specifically, we propose a teacher-student heterogeneous network (TSHN) to discriminate and distill label noise. Following the notion that labels represent information, a teacher network, utilizing trusted few-shot labeled samples, reevaluates and corrects labels for a considerable number of untrusted labeled samples through meta-learning. By dividing and conquering untrusted labeled samples according to their confidence levels, the student network learns more effectively. Additionally, we propose a multiview signal (MVS) method to further enhance the performance of hard-to-classify categories with few-shot trusted labeled samples. Extensive experiments on the RadioML2016 and HisarMod2019.1 data sets demonstrate that our methods significantly improve accuracy and robustness in signal AMC across diverse label noise scenarios, including symmetric, asymmetric, and mixed label noise. For example, compared to the baseline convolutional neural network with the cross-entropy loss, our proposed TSHN achieves a remarkable 1.26% to 36.84% accuracy improvement under symmetric label noise and 0.12% to 38.59% accuracy improvement under mixed label noise. Moreover, TSHN exhibits greater robustness to varying label noise rates compared to existing methods.",

We use meta-learning to help the model identify different types of image distortion. First, because the information taken as input by the human visual system (HVS) ranges in scale from local to global, we use a Conformer network as a feature extractor to obtain the global and local features of the pristine and distorted images and use a Siamese network to reduce the number of parameters in our model. Second, we use meta-learning to carry out bilevel gradient descent from the query set to the support set in the training stage and fine-tune the model parameters on a few images with unknown distortion types in the testing stage to improve the generalization ability of the model.

Traditional scheduling methods face limitations in adapting to such dynamic and flexible environments. Recently, there has been a trend in employing reinforcement learning (RL) to train scheduling agents for selecting manual scheduling heuristics at various decision points for DFJSS. However, the effectiveness of RL is constrained by the limited efficacy of the manually designed scheduling heuristics. Additionally, the process of manually designing diverse scheduling heuristics as the actions demands significant expert knowledge. In response, this paper proposes a Niching genetic programming (GP)-assisted RL method that leverages the evolutionary capabilities of GP to help RL solve the DFJSS problem effectively. Specifically, instead of using those manual scheduling heuristics, the RL actions are replaced with scheduling heuristics evolved by the Niching GP to optimise and adapt these heuristics based on real-time feedback from the environment. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to the widely used manual scheduling heuristics and the baseline deep RL method. Further analyses reveal that the effectiveness of the proposed method is due to the behavioral differences among heuristics learned by the Niching GP, serving as actions for the RL. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm benefits from the comparable percentages of contributions made by these learned heuristics throughout the long-term scheduling process.",

The capacity to predict ASD, however, differs across investigations. Our study\u2019s objective was to conduct a meta-analysis to determine the DL for ASD in children\u2019s classification accuracy. Methods Eligibility criteria were designed according to the purpose of the meta-analysis; PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science Database were searched for articles published up to April 16, 2023, on the accuracy of DL methods for ASD classification. Using the Revised Tool for the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) to assess the quality of the included studies. Sensitivity, specificity, areas under the curve (AUC), summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC), and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were compiled by using the bivariate random-effects models. Results A total of 11 predictive trials based on DL models were included, involving 9495 ASD patients from 6 different databases. According to bivariate random-effects models\u2019 results, the overall sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of the DL technique for ASD were, 0.95 (95% CI\u2009=\u20090.88\u20130.98), 0.93 (95% CI\u2009=\u20090.85\u20130.97), and 0.98 (95%CI: 0.97\u20130.99), respectively. Subgroup analysis results found that different datasets did not cause heterogeneity (meta-regression P\u2009=\u20090.55). The Kaggle dataset\u2019s sensitivity and specificity were 0.94 (95%CI: 0.82-1.00) and 0.91 (95%CI: 0.76-1.00), and with 0.97 (95%CI: 0.92-1.00) and 0.97 (95%CI: 0.92-1.00) for ABIDE dataset. Conclusions DL techniques has satisfactory sensitivity, specificity, and AUC in ASD classification. However, the major heterogeneity of the included studies limited the effectiveness of this meta-analysis. Further trials need to be performed to demonstrate the clinical practicability of DL diagnosis.

Dispensing with the conventional manual crafting of prompts, the recent prompt tuning method of Context Optimization (CoOp) introduces adaptable vectors as text prompts. Nevertheless, several previous works point out that the CoOp-based approaches are easy to overfit to the base classes and hard to generalize to novel classes. In this paper, we reckon that the prompt tuning works well only in the base classes because of the limited capacity of the adaptable vectors. The scale of the pre-trained model is hundreds times the scale of the adaptable vector, thus the learned vector has a very limited ability to absorb the knowledge of novel classes. To minimize this excessive overfitting of textual knowledge on the base class, we view prompt tuning as learning to learn (LoL) and learn the prompt in the way of meta-learning, the training manner of dividing the base classes into many different subclasses could fully exert the limited capacity of prompt tuning and thus transfer it power to recognize the novel classes. To be specific, we initially perform fine-tuning on the base class based on the CoOp method for pre-trained CLIP. Subsequently, predicated on the fine-tuned CLIP model, we carry out further fine-tuning in an N-way K-shot manner from the perspective of meta-learning on the base classes. We finally apply the learned textual vector and VLM for unseen classes.Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the efficacy of our meta-learning-informed prompt tuning, affirming its role as a robust optimization strategy for VLMs.",

In the medical field, the availability of annotated images is often limited. To address this challenge, few-shot learning techniques have been successfully adapted to rapidly generalize to new tasks with only a few samples, leveraging prior knowledge. In this paper, we employ a gradient-based method known as Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) for medical image segmentation. MAML is a meta-learning algorithm that quickly adapts to new tasks by updating a model\u2019s parameters based on a limited set of training samples. Additionally, we use an enhanced 3D U-Net as the foundational network for our models. The enhanced 3D U-Net is a convolutional neural network specifically designed for medical image segmentation. We evaluate our approach on the TotalSegmentator dataset, considering a few annotated images for four tasks: liver, spleen, right kidney, and left kidney. The results demonstrate that our approach facilitates rapid adaptation to new tasks using only a few annotated images. In 10-shot settings, our approach achieved mean dice coefficients of 93.70%, 85.98%, 81.20%, and 89.58% for liver, spleen, right kidney, and left kidney segmentation, respectively. In five-shot sittings, the approach attained mean Dice coefficients of 90.27%, 83.89%, 77.53%, and 87.01% for liver, spleen, right kidney, and left kidney segmentation, respectively.

The variance of feature extraction for different subjects compromises the possibility of designing a dependency-free system for APR. To address this problem, we present an unsupervised multimodal learning framework to infer personality traits from audio, visual, and verbal modalities. Our method both extracts the handcraft features and transfers deep-learning based embeddings from other tasks (e.g., emotion recognition) to recognize personality traits. Since these representations are extracted locally in the time domain, we present an unsupervised temporal aggregation method to aggregate the extracted features over the temporal dimension. We evaluate our method on the ChaLearn dataset, the most widely referenced dataset for APR, using a dependency-free split of the dataset. Our results show that the proposed feature extraction and temporal aggregation modules do not require personality annotations in training but still outperform other state-of-the-art baseline methods. We also address the problem of subject-dependency in the original split of the ChaLearn dataset. The newly proposed split (i.e., data for training, validation, and testing) of the dataset can benefit the community by providing a more accurate method to validate the subject-generalizability of APR algorithms.",

It is highly desirable to learn the generic encrypted traffic representations to investigate the common knowledge across different ETC tasks and rapidly adapt to the dynamic shifts. To fill the gap, we propose MetaRockETC, a generic encrypted traffic classification framework, which extracts protocol-agnostic features to learn the common knowledge and rapidly adapt to novel ETC tasks and evolving network environments. In MetaRockETC, we first model packet length sequences of encrypted sessions as multivariate time series and perform random convolution kernel transformations to summarize discriminatory behavioral patterns across channels. By integrating MetaRockETC into an advanced Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) framework, we learn a task-adaptive loss function to facilitate better generalization and transferability across diverse ETC tasks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MetaRockETC in both across-task and few-shot scenarios, highlighting its potential to provide a practical solution for encrypted traffic classification in real-world scenarios.",

Besides, commonly used adaptive learning and fine-tuning technique is unsuitable for adversarial defense since it is essentially a zero-shot problem when deployed. Thus, to tackle this challenge, we propose an attack-agnostic defense method named Meta Invariance Defense (MID). Specifically, various combinations of adversarial attacks are randomly sampled from a manually constructed Attacker Pool to constitute different defense tasks against unknown attacks, in which a student encoder is supervised by multi-consistency distillation to learn the attack-invariant features via a meta principle. The proposed MID has two merits: 1) Full distillation from pixel-, feature- and prediction-level between benign and adversarial samples facilitates the discovery of attack-invariance. 2) The model simultaneously achieves robustness to the imperceptible adversarial perturbations in high-level image classification and attack-suppression in low-level robust image regeneration. Theoretical and empirical studies on numerous benchmarks such as ImageNet verify the generalizable robustness and superiority of MID under various attacks.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have led many contemporary automatic modulation classification (AMC) techniques to use deep networks in classifying the modulation type of incoming signals at the receiver. However, current DL-based methods face scalability challenges, particularly when encountering unseen modulations or input signals from environments not present during model training, making them less suitable for real-world applications like software-defined radio devices. In this paper, we introduce a scalable AMC scheme that provides flexibility for new modulations and adaptability to input signals with diverse configurations. We propose the Meta-Transformer, a meta-learning framework based on few-shot learning (FSL) to acquire general knowledge and a learning method for AMC tasks. This approach empowers the model to identify new unseen modulations using only a very small number of samples, eliminating the need for complete model retraining. Furthermore, we enhance the scalability of the classifier by leveraging main-sub transformer-based encoders, enabling efficient processing of input signals with diverse setups. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed AMC method outperforms existing techniques across all signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) on RadioML2018.01A.

        "abstract": "Recently, deep learning has made brilliant achievements in wind turbine bearing fault diagnosis field. However, there are two problems that cannot be ignored: 1) the fault data are so scarce that it is time-consuming to acquire a well-behaved deep learning model and 2) much unlabeled data cannot be adequately utilized to explore useful fault information without prior. Therefore, a novel semi-supervised temporal meta-learning (SSTML) method is proposed, which can not only probe representative deep features from massive raw unlabeled vibration data adequately but also make the best of small annotation data to complete fault identification tasks. Transplanting meta-learning ideas into semi-supervised learning (SSL), a novel deep learning framework\u2014SeMeF\u2014is proposed. The proposed SeMeF is capable of drawing on the advantages of two mechanisms to exert efficiency beyond themselves. Furthermore, a temporal convolutional module is proposed to relieve overfitting due to the depth of the model, which can fully excavate temporal features along the depth of the network. The superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated on the wind turbine bearing dataset. Experimental results indicate that the model proposed can reach high diagnostic accuracy with limited annotation data, which outperforms many advanced deep learning models.",

        "abstract": "With the emergence of smartphones, Android has become a widely used mobile operating system. However, it is vulnerable when encountering various types of attacks. Every day, new malware threatens the security of users\u2019 devices and private data. Many methods have been proposed to classify malicious applications, utilizing static or dynamic analysis for classification. However, previous methods still suffer from unsatisfactory performance due to two challenges. First, they are unable to address the imbalanced data distribution problem, leading to poor performance for malware families with few members. Second, they are unable to address the zero-day malware (zero-day malware refers to malicious applications that exploit unknown vulnerabilities) classification problem. In this article, we introduce an innovative meta-learning approach for multi-family Android malware classification named Meta-MAMC, which uses meta-learning technology to learn meta-knowledge (i.e., the similarities and differences among different malware families) of few-family samples and combines new sampling algorithms to solve the above challenges. Meta-MAMC integrates (i) the meta-knowledge contained within the dataset to guide models in learning to identify unknown malware; and (ii) more accurate and diverse tasks based on novel sampling strategies, as well as directly adapting meta-learning to a new few-sample and zero-sample task to classify families. We have evaluated Meta-MAMC on two popular datasets and a corpus of real-world Android applications. The results demonstrate its efficacy in accurately classifying malicious applications belonging to certain malware families, even achieving 100% classification in some families.",

Accurate modeling of these interactions is important to optimize driving performance, but the relevant physical phenomena, such as slip, are too complex to model from first principles. Therefore, we present an offline meta-learning algorithm to construct a rapidly-tunable model of residual dynamics and disturbances. Our model processes terrain images into features using a visual foundation model (VFM), then maps these features and the vehicle state to an estimate of the current actuation matrix using a deep neural network (DNN). We then combine this model with composite adaptive control to modify the last layer of the DNN in real time, accounting for the remaining terrain interactions not captured during offline training. We provide mathematical guarantees of stability and robustness for our controller, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through simulations and hardware experiments with a tracked vehicle and a car-like robot. We evaluate our method outdoors on different slopes with varying slippage and actuator degradation disturbances, and compare against an adaptive controller that does not use the VFM terrain features. We show significant improvement over the baseline in both hardware experimentation and simulation.",

Thus, multi-operator learning is capable of predicting a range of operators within one model. In this work, we propose pretraining and fine-tuning strategies for solving PDEs using multi-operator learning. One key aspect is that by increasing the number of families of operators used in pretraining, a PDE foundation model can be fine-tuned to downstream tasks involving new PDEs with a limited number of samples, thus outperforming single operator neural networks. Specifically, a multi-operator learning model pre-trained with data from diverse PDE families can predict unseen operators after fine-tuning with only a limited number of operators from the new family, enabling them to serve as a data-free PDE solver. We also show that the proposed training and fine-tuning method is able to predict new operators in zero-shot prediction without samples. Additionally, we introduce a PDE-agnostic meta-learning algorithm to improve the adaptability of the model to various PDEs by providing a better parameter initialization process. To address the needs of applications with limited computing resources, we explore low-rank adaptation methods that reduce computational costs while enhancing solver accuracy. Lastly, by examining the scaling law with respect to the number of operator families, we establish and highlight its potential for broad adaptation in PDE-solving tasks.",

        "abstract": "Driver Distraction Detection (3D) is of great significance in helping intelligent vehicles decide whether to remind drivers or take over the driving task and avoid traffic accidents. However, the current centralized learning paradigm of 3D has become unpractical because of rising limitations on data sharing and increasing concerns about user privacy. In this context, 3D is further facing three emerging challenges, namely data islands, data heterogeneity, and the straggler issue. To jointly address these three issues and make the 3D model training and deployment more practical and efficient, this paper proposes an Asynchronous Federated Meta-learning framework called AFM3D. Specifically, AFM3D bridges data islands through Federated Learning (FL), a novel distributed learning paradigm that enables multiple clients (i.e., private vehicles with individual data of drivers) to learn a global model collaboratively without data exchange. Moreover, AFM3D further utilizes meta-learning to tackle data heterogeneity by training a meta-model that can adapt to new driver data quickly with satisfactory performance. Finally, AFM3D is designed to operate in an asynchronous mode to reduce delays caused by stragglers and achieve efficient learning. A temporally weighted aggregation strategy is also designed to handle stale models commonly encountered in the asynchronous mode and in turn, optimize the aggregation direction. Extensive experiment results show that AFM3D can boost performance in terms of model accuracy, recall, F1 score, test loss, and learning speed by 7.61%, 7.44%, 7.95%, 9.95%, and 50.91%, respectively, against five state-of-the-art methods.",

The key idea in MADA is to parameterize the space of optimizers and dynamically search through it using hyper-gradient descent during training. We empirically compare MADA to other popular optimizers on vision and language tasks, and find that MADA consistently outperforms Adam and other popular optimizers, and is robust against sub-optimally tuned hyper-parameters. MADA achieves a greater validation performance improvement over Adam compared to other popular optimizers during GPT-2 training and fine-tuning. We also propose AVGrad, a modification of AMSGrad that replaces the maximum operator with averaging, which is more suitable for hyper-gradient optimization.

To improve its security performance, some DIH methods design Security Metrics (SMs) to guide the learning of their hiding networks. However, these methods focus on optimizing their anti-steganalysis ability on specific SMs, resulting in inferior generalization ability. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we introduce meta-learning into DIH and propose Meta Security Metric-based DIH (MSM-DIH). In the MSM-DIH, the Invertible Neural Network (INN)-based hiding network is learned under the guidance of a learnable meta SM generalized from multiple fixed source SMs, and each SM is composed of a metric network and a contrastive loss function. Specifically, MSM-DIH is trained with bi-level optimization. In the outer optimization, a meta SM is learned to assign higher security scores for more advanced stego images. Besides, the domain knowledge of steganalysis is transferred from the multiple pre-trained source metric networks to the meta metric network, so as to enhance the generalization ability of the meta SM. In the inner optimization, the hiding network is learned to generate more secure stego images according to the learned meta SM. Experimental results show that our MSM-DIH has achieved the best security performance in most cases.",

Training models on these datasets will further decrease the exposure of the minority groups. To address this problem, we propose a Meta Curriculum-based Fair Ranking framework (MCFR) which could alleviate the data bias issue through the weighted loss using gradient-based learning to learn. Specifically, we optimize a meta learner from a sampled dataset (meta-dataset), and meanwhile train a ranking model on the whole (biased) dataset. The meta-dataset is sampled with a curriculum learning scheduler to guide the meta learner's training to gradually mitigate the skewness towards biased attributes. The meta learner serves as a weighting function to make the ranking loss focus more on the minority group. We formulate the proposed MCFR as a bilevel optimization problem and solve it using gradients through gradients. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach can be used as a generic framework to work with various ranking losses and fairness metrics.",

It aims to adjust the scale of attributes in a way that they all vary within the same range. This transformation is known to improve the performance of classification models. Still, there are several scaling techniques (STs) to choose from, and no ST is guaranteed to be the best for a dataset regardless of the classifier chosen. It is thus a problem- and classifier-dependent decision. Furthermore, there can be a huge difference in performance when selecting the wrong technique; hence, it should not be neglected. That said, the trial-and-error process of finding the most suitable technique for a particular dataset can be unfeasible. As an alternative, we propose the Meta-scaler, which uses meta-learning (MtL) to build meta-models to automatically select the best ST for a given dataset and classification algorithm. The meta-models learn to represent the relationship between meta-features extracted from the datasets and the performance of specific classification algorithms on these datasets when scaled with different techniques. Our experiments using 12 base classifiers, 300 datasets, and five STs demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach. When using the ST selected by the Meta-scaler for each dataset, 10 of 12 base models tested achieved statistically significantly better classification performance than any fixed choice of a single ST. The Meta-scaler also outperforms state-of-the-art MtL approaches for ST selection.

Despite their perceived strong empirical performance on downstream tasks, a line of recent studies by Bengs et al. identify limitations of the existing methods to conclude their learned epistemic uncertainties are unreliable, e.g., in that they are non-vanishing even with infinite data. Building on and sharpening such analysis, we 1) provide a sharper understanding of the asymptotic behavior of a wide class of EDL methods by unifying various objective functions; 2) reveal that the EDL methods can be better interpreted as an out-of-distribution detection algorithm based on energy-based-models; and 3) conduct extensive ablation studies to better assess their empirical effectiveness with real-world datasets. Through all these analyses, we conclude that even when EDL methods are empirically effective on downstream tasks, this occurs despite their poor uncertainty quantification capabilities. Our investigation suggests that incorporating model uncertainty can help EDL methods faithfully quantify uncertainties and further improve performance on representative downstream tasks, albeit at the cost of additional computational complexity.",

However, existing GNN methods struggle with the complexity of the heterogeneous graphs induced by databases with numerous tables and relations. Traditional approaches either consider all possible relational meta-paths, thus failing to scale with the number of relations, or rely on domain experts to identify relevant meta-paths. A recent solution does manage to learn informative meta-paths without expert supervision, but assumes that a node's class depends solely on the existence of a meta-path occurrence. In this work, we present a self-explainable heterogeneous GNN for relational data, that supports models in which class membership depends on aggregate information obtained from multiple occurrences of a meta-path. Experimental results show that in the context of relational databases, our approach effectively identifies informative meta-paths that faithfully capture the model's reasoning mechanisms.

These deep learning based methods learn ST correlations to support the downstream tasks in the fields such as smart mobility, smart city and other intelligent transportation systems. Despite their effectiveness, ST data fusion and forecasting methods face practical challenges in real-world scenarios. First, forecasting performance for ST data-insufficient area is inferior, making it necessary to transfer meta knowledge from heterogeneous area to enhance the sparse representations. Second, it is nontrivial to accurately forecast in multi-transportation-mode scenarios due to the fine-grained ST features of similar transportation modes, making it necessary to distinguish and measure the ST correlations to alleviate the influence caused by entangled ST features. At last, partial data modalities (e.g., transportation mode) are lost due to privacy or technical issues in certain scenarios, making it necessary to effectively fuse the multimodal sparse ST features and enrich the ST representations. To tackle these challenges, our research work aim to develop effective fusion and forecasting methods for multimodal ST data in smart mobility scenario.

Most of the current machine learning\u2010based methods assume the availability for a large amount of data. However, in practice, the authors may only have a very limited amount of training data, which makes it hard to learn a reliable machine learning model. To address this concern, in this work, the authors propose to tackle EFD via meta learning. Specifically, the authors first formulate EFD as a few\u2010shot learning problem and then propose to tackle this problem with a metric\u2010based meta learning method. Furthermore, ensemble learning is further leveraged to improve the detection robustness. For the proposed method, the distribution difference from the working conditions and the bearings are considered.

Due to different population distributions and user behavior, there exist strong spatial-temporal variations in wireless traffic across different regions. Most of the conventional traffic prediction approaches can only tackle a particular spatial-temporal pattern and cannot capture such variations in wireless traffic. This motivates us to develop an adaptive approach which can tackle spatial-temporal variations and predict wireless traffic in different regions. In this paper, we formulate an adaptive traffic prediction problem from a probabilistic inference perspective and develop a variational spatial-temporal Bayesian meta-learning (VST-BML) algorithm. We model the traffic prediction in different regions as different prediction tasks. The proposed VST-BML algorithm can learn the common spatial-temporal features shared by all prediction tasks, and adaptively infer the task-specific parameters to tackle spatial-temporal variations. We evaluate the performance of our proposed VST-BML algorithm using a real-world traffic dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can quickly adapt to different prediction tasks by using only a small number of data samples and provide accurate traffic prediction in different regions. When compared with five baseline methods, the proposed algorithm can reduce the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) by 53.0% and 48.4%, respectively.",

In this work, we propose a shift to deep metric-based meta-learning in EMG PR to supervise the creation of meaningful and interpretable representations. We use a Siamese Deep Convolutional Neural Network (SDCNN) and contrastive triplet loss to learn an EMG feature embedding space that captures the distribution of the different classes. A nearest-centroid approach is subsequently employed for inference, relying on how closely a test sample aligns with the established data distributions. We derive a robust class proximity-based confidence estimator that leads to a better rejection of incorrect decisions, i.e. false positives, especially when operating beyond the training data domain. We show our approach's efficacy by testing the trained SDCNN's predictions and confidence estimations on unseen data, both in and out of the training domain. The evaluation metrics include the accuracy-rejection curve and the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the confidence distributions of accurate and inaccurate predictions. Outperforming comparable models on both metrics, our results demonstrate that the proposed meta-learning approach improves the classifier's precision in active decisions (after rejection), thus leading to better generalization and applicability.",

The transformation matrices perform dimension reduction in the uplink and dimension expansion in the downlink. To reduce the communication overhead for designing the transformation matrices, this paper further proposes a deep learning framework to first learn a suboptimal transformation matrix at each RRH based on the local channel state information (CSI), and then to refine it iteratively. To facilitate the refinement process, we propose an efficient signaling scheme that only requires the transmission of low-dimensional effective CSI and its gradient between the CP and RRH, and further, a meta-learning based gated recurrent unit network to reduce the number of signaling transmission rounds. For the sum-rate maximization problem, simulation results show that the proposed two-stage neural network can perform close to the fully cooperative global CSI based benchmark with significantly reduced communication overhead for both the uplink and the downlink.

Most existing DNN repair methods only focus on repairing DNN for each corruption separately, lacking the ability of generalizing to the myriad corruptions from the ever-changing deploying environment. In this work, we propose to repair DNN from a novel perspective, i.e. Learning to Repair (L2R), where the repairing of target DNN is realized as a general learning-to-learn, a.k.a. meta-learning, process. In specific, observing different corruptions are correlated on their data distributions, we propose to utilize previous DNN repair experiences as tasks for meta-learning how to repair the target corruption. With the meta-learning from different tasks, L2R learns a meta-knowledge that summarizes how the DNN is repaired under various environmental corruptions. The meta-knowledge essentially serves as a general repairing prior which enables the DNN quickly adapt to unknown corruptions, thus making our method generalizable to different type of corruptions. Practically, L2R benefits DNN repair with a general pipeline yet tailoring meta-learning for repairing DNN is not trivial. By re-designing the meta-learning components under DNN repair context, we further instantiate the proposed L2R strategy into a concrete model named MetaRepair with pragmatic assumption of experience availability. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the corrupted CIFAR-10 and tiny -ImageNet by applying MetaRepair to repair DenseNet, ConvNeXt and VAN. The experimental results confirmed the superior repairing and generalization capability of our proposed L2R strategy under various environmental corruptions.",

        "abstract": "Motor fault diagnosis is a fundamental aspect of ensuring the reliability of industrial equipment. However, industrial scenarios exhibit an inherent data scarcity problem, which imposes significant restrictions on the practical application of traditional deep learning-based intelligent fault diagnosis (IFD) methods. Typically, only a small volume of labeled data along with limited informative unlabeled data are available from industrial motors. Effectively utilizing informative unlabeled samples in the context of few-shot fault diagnosis poses a substantial challenge. In this article, a prototype refinement method for semi-supervised few-shot fault diagnosis based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed. First, we propose to formalize a Markov decision process (MDP) of an iterative semi-supervised meta-learning strategy involving the selection of informative unlabeled samples and the refinement of category prototypes. Subsequently, we develop a mirror prototypical network (ProtoNet) structure for interaction with a DRL agent, which learns to adaptively select valuable samples to supervise the diagnosis process. Moreover, a state space involving feature embedding and category information is designed, and a comprehensive reward taking into account selection confidence, effectiveness, and representative is proposed. Extensive experiments on several motor experimental datasets verify the method\u2019s effectiveness in few-shot diagnosis of unseen faults and new working conditions.",

Due to the proliferation of touch-screen devices, sketching has become more accessible and therefore has received increasing attention. Deep learning has emerged as a potential tool for SBIR, allowing models to automatically extract image features and learn from large amounts of data. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no systematic literature review (SLR) of SBIR with deep learning. Therefore, the aim of this review is to incorporate related works into a systematic study, highlighting the main contributions of individual researchers over the years, with a focus on past, present and future trends. To achieve the purpose of this study, 90 studies from 2016 to June 2023 in 4 databases were collected and analyzed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework. The specific models, datasets, evaluation metrics, and applications of deep learning in SBIR are discussed in detail. This study found that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are the most widely used deep learning methods for SBIR. A commonly used dataset is Sketchy, especially in the latest Zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR) task. The results show that Mean Average Precision (mAP) is the most commonly used metric for quantitative evaluation of SBIR.

Next, a relation graph learning module is proposed to construct a relation graph based on the similarity between molecules, which improves the efficiency of information propagation and the accuracy of property prediction. In addition, we use a MAML-based meta-learning strategy to learn well-initialized meta-parameters. In order to guide the tuning of meta-parameters, a property-guided feature augmentation module is designed to transfer information from similar properties to the novel property to improve the comprehensiveness of the feature representation of molecules with novel property.

        "abstract": "Humans can often quickly and efficiently solve new complex learning tasks given only a small set of examples. In contrast, modern artificially intelligent systems often require thousands or millions of observations in order to solve even the most basic tasks. Meta-learning aims to resolve this issue by leveraging past experiences from similar learning tasks to embed the appropriate inductive biases into the learning system. Historically methods for meta-learning components such as optimizers, parameter initializations, and more have led to significant performance increases. This thesis aims to explore the concept of meta-learning to improve performance, through the often-overlooked component of the loss function. The loss function is a vital component of a learning system, as it represents the primary learning objective, where success is determined and quantified by the system's ability to optimize for that objective successfully. In this thesis, we developed methods for meta-learning the loss function of deep neural networks. In particular, we first introduced a method for meta-learning symbolic model-agnostic loss function called Evolved Model Agnostic Loss (EvoMAL). This method consolidates recent advancements in loss function learning and enables the development of interpretable loss functions on commodity hardware. Through empirical and theoretical analysis, we uncovered patterns in the learned loss functions, which later inspired the development of Sparse Label Smoothing Regularization (SparseLSR), which is a significantly faster and more memory-efficient way to perform label smoothing regularization. Second, we challenged the conventional notion that a loss function must be a static function by developing Adaptive Loss Function Learning (AdaLFL), a method for meta-learning adaptive loss functions. Lastly, we developed Neural Procedural Bias Meta-Learning (NPBML) a task-adaptive few-shot learning method that meta-learns the parameter initialization, optimizer, and loss function simultaneously.",

The supremacy of deep learning in artificial intelligence (AI) contexts, including image and speech recognition, computer vision, and medical imaging, among others, has established it as AI\u2019s dominant approach. Several studies have been conducted on the use of deep learning in physiological signals, especially in ECG signals, in recent years, but there has been a lack of comprehensive review on the use of deep learning in ECG for biometric systems. This review is divided into two main sections: it provides a comprehensive bibliographic review of deep learning for ECG classification towards assisting in disease diagnosis in the first part while presenting an overview of the field, pioneers, and landmark studies. The second part offers comprehensive information on the subject, starting with the mathematical background of deep learning algorithms, the ECG signal processing, and the function of the heart. Using a PRISMA framework, 309 research papers were initially identified through specified keywords. After applying inclusion criteria, 90 articles were retained for detailed analysis, excluding 24 documents based on exclusion criteria EC1 and the remainder due to EC2. Key findings reveal that deep learning models achieve an average accuracy improvement of 10-15% over traditional methods, with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) demonstrating superior performance in capturing complex ECG patterns. Through ECG databases, deep learning algorithms, assessment frameworks, metrics, and code availability, this review designs a systematic view from different perspectives to highlight the trends, challenges, and opportunities of deep learning for ECG arrhythmia classification. This paper\u2019s goal is to contribute to the knowledge of both new and experienced researchers and practitioners in the field so that they can learn and understand the various processes involved in ECG signal processing using deep learning.",

        "abstract": "Modern natural language processing (NLP) state-of-the-art (SoTA) deep learning (DL) models have hundreds of millions of parameters, making them extremely complex. Large datasets are required for training these models, and while pretraining has reduced this requirement, human-labelled datasets are still necessary for fine-tuning. Few-shot learning (FSL) techniques, such as meta-learning, try to train models from smaller datasets to mitigate this cost. However, the tasks used to evaluate these meta-learners frequently diverge from the problems in the real world that they are meant to resolve. This work aims to apply meta-learning to a problem that is more pertinent to the real world: class incremental learning (IL). In this scenario, after completing its training, the model learns to classify newly introduced classes. One unique quality of meta-learners is that they can generalise from a small sample size to classes that have never been seen before, which makes them especially useful for class incremental learning (IL). The method describes how to emulate class IL using proxy new classes. This method allows a meta-learner to complete the task without the need for retraining. To generate predictions, the transformer-based aggregation function in a meta-learner that modifies data from examples across all classes has been proposed. The principal contributions of the model include concurrently considering the entire support and query sets, and prioritising attention to crucial samples, such as the question, to increase the significance of its impact during inference. The outcomes demonstrate that the model surpasses prevailing benchmarks in the industry. Notably, most meta-learners demonstrate significant generalisation in the context of class IL even without specific training for this task. This paper establishes a high-performing baseline for subsequent transformer-based aggregation techniques, thereby emphasising the practical significance of meta-learners in class IL.",

Recent work has showed the superiority of multi-omics data in survival analysis. However, it remains challenging to integrate multi-omics data to solve few-shot survival prediction problem, with only a few available training samples, especially for rare cancers. Results In this work, we propose a meta-learning framework for multi-omics few-shot survival analysis, namely MMOSurv, which enables to learn an effective multi-omics survival prediction model from a very few training samples of a specific cancer type, with the meta-knowledge across tasks from relevant cancer types. By assuming a deep Cox survival model with multiple omics, MMOSurv first learns an adaptable parameter initialization for the multi-omics survival model from abundant data of relevant cancers, and then adapts the parameters quickly and efficiently for the target cancer task with a very few training samples. Our experiments on eleven cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets show that, compared to single-omics meta-learning methods, MMOSurv can better utilize the meta-information of similarities and relationships between different omics data from relevant cancer datasets to improve survival prediction of the target cancer with a very few multi-omics training samples. Furthermore, MMOSurv achieves better prediction performance than other state-of-the-art strategies such as multitask learning and pretraining.

        "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has achieved great success in many challenging domains. However, sample efficiency and safety issues still prevent from applying deep reinforcement learning directly in robotics. Sim-to-real transfer learning is one feasible solution to tackle these problems and address the reality gap between simulation and reality. In this letter, we propose to combine meta-reinforcement learning and progressive neural network (PNN) by meta-training a policy for multiple source tasks and transferring it to the real-world robot via PNN (MetaPNN). We expect that training meta-policy over meta-tasks without considering dynamics discrepancy with our method can bridge the gap between simulation and reality with mismatched dynamics, and allow the agent to learn one single policy solving multiple tasks instead of using one policy network in PNN to solve one task. Meanwhile, the transferred meta-policy via PNN is expected to solve the target task and adapt to new situations at the same time. Our results in a variety of target tasks in AntPos and Reach with simulated manipulator show that MetaPNN can significantly improve the robot's learning efficiency and performance. Our further results in real-world Reach tasks with physical robot arm and a new task that is different from the meta-tasks show there might be a synergy between meta-learning and PNN.",

Current prevailing CSI feedback approaches improve precision by employing advanced deep-learning methods to learn representative CSI features for a subsequent compression process. Diverging from previous works, we treat the CSI compression problem in the context of implicit neural representations. Specifically, each CSI matrix is viewed as a neural function that maps the CSI coordinates (antenna number and subchannel) to the corresponding channel gains. Instead of transmitting the parameters of the implicit neural functions directly, we transmit modulations based on the CSI matrix derived through a meta-learning algorithm. Modulations are then applied to a shared base network to generate the elements of the CSI matrix. Modulations corresponding to the CSI matrix are quantized and entropy-coded to further reduce the communication bandwidth, thus achieving extreme CSI compression ratios. Numerical results show that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and showcases flexibility in feedback strategies.",

As relevant articles expand to tens or hundreds of thousands, computer-based approaches can increase the efficiency, transparency and reproducibility of literature-based research. Methods available for text mining are rapidly changing owing to developments in machine learning-based language models. We review the growing landscape of approaches, mapping them onto three broad paradigms (frequency-based approaches, traditional Natural Language Processing and deep learning-based language models). This serves as an entry point to learn foundational and cutting-edge concepts, vocabularies, and methods to foster integration of these tools into ecological and evolutionary research. We cover approaches for modelling ecological texts, generating training data, developing custom models and interacting with large language models and discuss challenges and possible solutions to implementing these methods in ecology and evolution.",

Existing eco-routing solutions do not effectively consider the critical traffic signal information and rely on fuel consumption models that may not be sufficiently accurate. To address the eco-routing problem in a signalized traffic network, this paper proposes a graph convolutional network based multi-objective meta-deep Q-learning (GM2DQL) method. The problem is formulated as dynamic multi-objective Markov decision processes (MOMDP) and is tackled through deep reinforcement learning and meta-learning. We identify that graph convolutional network (GCN) is an efficient and suitable feature representation for a signalized traffic network. GM2DQL can explore the optimal routes with respect to drivers\u2019 different preferences on saving fuel and travel time. Through GM2DQL, the agent is trained under a series of learning environments that are characterized by historical vehicle trajectories, fuel consumption data, and traffic signal data in the remote data center. The vehicle requesting eco-routing service can download the model that represents the action value function of the historical dynamic driving conditions. The model in the vehicle can quickly adapt to the most recent driving condition through online one-shot learning and predict the optimal eco-routes for the subsequent unseen driving conditions of the signalized traffic network. Extensive proof-of-concept experiments validate that GM2DQL can effectively discover optimal eco-routes. It saves up to 71% travel time and 62% fuel, compared to the conventional shortest-path routing strategy that is widely used in navigation systems.",

The unique aspects of each aerial node are highlighted and the few-shot learning as a model agnostic meta-learning (MAML) classifier is proposed for learning-to-learn (L2L) incident wave angle estimation by utilizing the received signal strength (RSS). Additionally, a more computationally efficient technique, first order model agnostic meta-learning (FOMAML) is implemented. It has been observed that the proposed approach reaches up to 85% training accuracy and 75.4% evaluation accuracy with MAML. Regarding this, a convergence rate and accuracy trade-off have been established for several cases of MAML and FOMAML. For different L2L models trained with limited data, heuristic accuracy performance is determined by an upper bound of the probability of confidence.",

From the\"learning to learn\"perspective, the quality of the initialization is modeled with one-step gradient decent in the inner loop. However, contrary to theoretical expectations, our empirical analysis reveals that this may expose meta-learning to underfitting. To bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementation, we reconsider meta-learning from the\"Learning\"lens. We propose that the meta-learning model comprises two interrelated components: parameters for model initialization and a meta-layer for task-specific fine-tuning. These components will lead to the risks of overfitting and underfitting depending on tasks, and their solutions, fewer parameters vs. more meta-layer, are often in conflict. To address this, we aim to regulate the task information the model receives without modifying the data or model structure. Our theoretical analysis indicates that models adapted to different tasks can mutually reinforce each other, highlighting the effective information. Based on this insight, we propose TRLearner, a plug-and-play method that leverages task relation to calibrate meta-learning. It first extracts task relation matrices and then applies relation-aware consistency regularization to guide optimization. Extensive theoretical and empirical evaluations demonstrate its effectiveness.",

The main challenge is that the samples are prone to be outdated as the indoor environment changes or the wireless signal varies over time, i.e., the samples\u2019 Age of Information (AoI) is large, which leads to the trained model not being available. However, recollecting data to retrain the model is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address the above problem, this article proposes a fast adaptation approach based on Bayesian meta-learning that makes the pretrained model acquire a learned learning capability so that it can quickly learn new tasks based on the acquisition of existing knowledge. Specifically, first, a model-agnostic learning scheme is introduced to guide the learning process, which could automatically learn the optimal model parameters and hyperparameter settings. Second, to mitigate the effects of model uncertainty, especially to prevent the overfitting situation based on a limited number of samples, we combine the Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) with the model-agnostic learning scheme, i.e., Bayesian meta-learning. Compared with traditional meta-learning algorithms, the proposed method makes the training more robust by inferring the Bayesian posterior from a probabilistic perspective. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed approach effectively overcomes the impact of large AoI on localization performance while decreasing labor consumption significantly.",
