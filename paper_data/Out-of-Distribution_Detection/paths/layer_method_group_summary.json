    "summary": "1.  <think>\nI will cluster the provided papers into three distinct subgroups based on their primary methodological approach, the type of problem they address, and their core contributions to the field of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection.\n\n**Cluster 1: Feature Representation & Transformation**\nThis cluster will include papers that primarily focus on analyzing, transforming, or learning better representations of features derived from standard deep learning models to improve OOD discrimination. Their core methodologies involve manipulating the feature space or the process of feature extraction/reconstruction.\n*   **[zhou202250i] Rethinking Reconstruction Autoencoder-Based Out-of-Distribution Detection (2022)**: Focuses on improving reconstruction-based OOD by re-evaluating autoencoder behavior in feature space (semantic reconstruction, maximally compressed latent space, NL2 distance).\n*   **[song2022f5d] RankFeat: Rank-1 Feature Removal for Out-of-distribution Detection (2022)**: Uses spectral analysis (SVD) to identify and remove a dominant rank-1 component from high-level features, directly manipulating the feature representation.\n*   **[lu20249d4] Learning with Mixture of Prototypes for Out-of-Distribution Detection (2024)**: Aims to learn more nuanced feature representations by modeling ID classes with multiple prototypes in a hyperspherical embedding space.\n\n**Cluster 2: Expanding OOD Scope & Data Modalities**\nThis cluster will group papers that extend the definition or application of OOD detection to more complex, realistic scenarios, different types of distribution shifts, or non-standard data modalities. They often introduce new problem settings or benchmarks.\n*   **[yang2022it3] Full-Spectrum Out-of-Distribution Detection (2022)**: Introduces the FS-OOD problem, distinguishing between semantic and covariate shifts, and proposes a feature-based score (SEM) to address this specific problem definition. Its primary contribution is the problem framing and benchmark.\n*   **[liu202227x] GOOD-D: On Unsupervised Graph Out-Of-Distribution Detection (2022)**: Pioneers unsupervised OOD detection for graph-structured data, a novel data modality for OOD.\n*   **[dong2024a8k] MultiOOD: Scaling Out-of-Distribution Detection for Multiple Modalities (2024)**: Addresses OOD detection in multimodal settings, introducing a new benchmark and algorithms for leveraging complementary information across modalities.\n\n**Cluster 3: Leveraging Auxiliary Information & Theoretical Foundations**\nThis cluster will comprise papers that leverage external sources of information (like unlabeled data or pre-trained large models) or provide strong theoretical guarantees to enhance OOD detection, often moving beyond reliance solely on labeled ID data.\n*   **[du20248xe] How Does Unlabeled Data Provably Help Out-of-Distribution Detection? (2024)**: Provides theoretical guarantees for using unlabeled \"wild\" data, introducing a gradient-based filtering mechanism.\n*   **[li20245b6] Learning Transferable Negative Prompts for Out-of-Distribution Detection (2024)**: Leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and prompt learning to define OOD boundaries through \"negative prompts,\" enabling open-vocabulary OOD detection without explicit OOD data.\n\nThis clustering strategy provides a good balance between methodological commonalities and the distinct problem spaces or foundational advancements each paper represents.",
