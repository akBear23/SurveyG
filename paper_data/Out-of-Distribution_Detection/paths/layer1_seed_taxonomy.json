However, their initial promise was often hampered by a fundamental flaw: their capacity to effectively reconstruct diverse OoD samples, rendering the simple reconstruction error an unreliable indicator of novelty. The paper \"[zhou202250i] Rethinking Reconstruction Autoencoder-Based Out-of-Distribution Detection (2022)\" marks a pivotal methodological progression, moving from a naive application of autoencoders to a highly sophisticated, multi-pronged framework.\n    *   Earlier autoencoder-based methods typically trained an autoencoder on in-distribution (ID) data, assuming that OoD inputs would yield high reconstruction errors. As `zhou202250i` meticulously details, this assumption frequently failed, leading to poor performance in challenging multi-class OoD detection tasks. Some prior attempts sought to constrain autoencoders, for instance, by using parametric density estimators in the latent space, but these often introduced biases or restrictive assumptions.\n    *   `zhou202250i` introduces a profound paradigm shift by formally defining autoencoder-based OoD detection as a quadruplet domain translation problem and deriving two critical preconditions for reconstruction error to be a valid uncertainty measure. Methodologically, it transitions from a general, pixel-level reconstruction task to a highly specialized and decomposed one. Instead of reconstructing raw image pixels, it innovatively targets \"Semantic Reconstruction\" of Activation Vector (AV) features extracted from the penultimate layer of a pre-trained classifier. This strategic choice significantly reduces the expressiveness requirement of the autoencoder's latent space, focusing its reconstructive power on lower-dimensional, semantic, and task-relevant features.\n    *   Further advancing the methodology, the paper introduces a \"maximally compressed latent space\" strategy. This involves minimizing a regularization loss during training to actively restrict ID latent features to a compact, known space. This is a direct departure from autoencoders that might learn a more expansive latent representation, which could inadvertently accommodate OoD samples. Perhaps the most innovative methodological progression is the \"Layerwise Semantic Reconstruction\" framework. Recognizing the challenge of recovering significant information loss from an extremely compressed latent space in a single step, this framework factorizes the probability of an input being ID into a product of conditional probabilities. This enables a series of decoders, each specifically designed to recover information lost after *each individual encoding layer*, rather than a single decoder attempting to recover all accumulated loss.\n\n*   *Problem evolution*: The central problem that `zhou202250i` meticulously addresses is the Achilles' heel of traditional reconstruction autoencoders in OoD detection: their inherent ability to reconstruct OoD samples effectively, leading to high false positive rates and rendering them unreliable. This fundamental flaw was a major impediment, preventing autoencoders from realizing their full potential as unsupervised OoD detectors.\n    *   Prior to `zhou202250i`, the field was grappling with the \"closed-world assumption\" of deep classifiers and the immense difficulty of defining and covering the vast, high-dimensional OoD space for supervised methods. While unsupervised methods like autoencoders offered a way to circumvent the need for explicit OoD data, their practical performance was often subpar precisely because of the aforementioned reconstruction problem.\n    *   `zhou202250i` directly confronts this by fundamentally re-evaluating the conditions under which reconstruction error can serve as a valid uncertainty measure. It also tackles a critical practical issue: the misleading nature of standard reconstruction error metrics. Neural networks often produce smaller activations for OoD samples, which can result in deceptively small L2 reconstruction errors, falsely indicating that an OoD sample is in-distribution. The paper explicitly solves this by introducing the `Normalized L2 Distance (NL2)`, which normalizes the reconstruction by the input's norm, thereby eliminating this confounding bias and providing a more reliable measure of reconstruction quality. The problem of information loss from highly compressed latent spaces, which could degrade reconstruction quality even for ID samples, is also effectively addressed by the innovative layerwise decomposition.\n\n*   *Key innovations*: The innovations introduced by `zhou202250i` are transformative, providing a robust foundation for advancing autoencoder-based OoD detection.\n    *   The **theoretical insight** formalizing OoD detection as quadruplet domain translation and establishing two preconditions for valid reconstruction error provides a rigorous conceptual underpinning for the entire framework.\n    *   The **\"maximally compressed latent space\"** strategy is a crucial algorithmic innovation that directly counteracts the autoencoder's tendency to generalize to OoD, ensuring the latent space is tightly bound to the characteristics of ID data.\n    *   **\"Semantic Reconstruction\" using Activation Vectors (AVs)** from a pre-trained classifier is a key system design innovation, simplifying the autoencoder's task, improving its efficiency, and focusing its learning on semantically relevant features.\n    *   The **\"Layerwise Semantic Reconstruction\" framework** is a breakthrough in architectural design, enabling the autoencoder to manage extreme compression while maintaining high reconstructive power for ID data through its incremental information recovery mechanism.\n    *   Finally, the **`Normalized L2 Distance (NL2)`** is a novel metric innovation that corrects a critical flaw in how reconstruction errors were previously evaluated, providing a more accurate and reliable signal for OoD detection. These innovations collectively enable `zhou202250i` to achieve state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that the potential of reconstruction autoencoders for OoD detection is significantly greater than previously realized.\n\n3. *Synthesis*\n\nThe unified intellectual trajectory of \"[zhou202250i] Rethinking Reconstruction Autoencoder-Based Out-of-Distribution Detection (2022)\" is a profound re-evaluation and sophisticated re-engineering of the autoencoder paradigm for Out-of-Distribution detection. Its collective contribution is to fundamentally address the long-standing weaknesses of reconstruction-based methods, transforming them from often-underperforming approaches into state-of-the-art solutions through theoretical insights, novel architectural designs, and robust evaluation metrics.",

With desirable characteristics, reconstruction autoencoder-based methods deal with this problem by using input reconstruction error as a metric of novelty vs. normality.

Accordingly, an improvement direction is formalized as maximumly compressing the autoencoder's latent space while ensuring its reconstructive power for acting as a described domain translator. From it, strategies are introduced including semantic reconstruction, data certainty decomposition and normalized L2 distance to substantially improve original methods, which together establish state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, e.g., the FPR@95%TPR of CIFAR-100 vs. TinyImagenet-crop on Wide-ResNet is 0.2%.

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \\cite{zhou202250i} for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** Detecting Out-of-Distribution (OoD) samples in deep learning classifiers, particularly for reconstruction autoencoder-based methods.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** Supervised classifiers operate under a closed-world assumption, failing in real-world scenarios where test data can be unknown. Neural networks can produce arbitrarily confident but erroneous predictions for unrecognizable inputs. While reconstruction autoencoders are a promising unsupervised approach, they often fail because they can effectively reconstruct various OoD samples, leading to poor performance in challenging multi-class OoD detection tasks.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches:** Many OoD methods rely on training with labeled OoD data (e.g., from other categories, adversaries, or leave-out subsets).\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n        *   Supervised OoD methods struggle to generalize due to the intractability of covering the full, high-dimensional OoD space, leading to data selection bias.\n        *   Introducing OoD data with additional training objectives can negatively impact the classifier's accuracy on in-distribution (ID) images.\n        *   Traditional reconstruction autoencoders are known to accurately reconstruct OoD samples, contradicting their core assumption for OoD detection.\n        *   Previous methods like latent space autoregression \\cite{2} constrain autoencoders using parametric density estimators, which can be biased under restrictive assumptions.\n    *   **Positioning:** \\cite{zhou202250i} addresses the fundamental flaw of autoencoder-based OoD detection by re-evaluating the conditions under which reconstruction error is a valid uncertainty measure. It differentiates itself by seeking a *maximally compressed latent space* without relying on parametric density estimators, and by introducing a novel layerwise semantic reconstruction framework.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper formulates autoencoder-based OoD detection as a quadruplet domain translation problem. It proposes that for reconstruction error to be a valid data uncertainty measure, two preconditions must be met: 1) the latent feature lies within the domain of encoded ID samples, and 2) the decoder has adequate reconstructive power.\n    *   **Novelty:**\n        *   **Maximally Compressed Latent Space:** The approach aims to maximally condense the autoencoder's latent space while preserving its reconstructive power for ID data. This is achieved by minimizing a regularization loss to restrict ID latent features to a compact, known space, thereby improving the estimation of whether an input's latent feature is in the ID domain.\n        *   **Semantic Reconstruction:** Instead of reconstructing raw image pixels, the method reconstructs Activation Vector (AV) features (output of the penultimate layer of a pre-trained classifier). This reduces the expressiveness requirement of the latent space, as AVs are lower-dimensional, semantic, and task-relevant.\n        *   **Data Certainty Decomposition (Layerwise Semantic Reconstruction):** To overcome the challenge of recovering significant information loss from a highly compressed latent space, the paper factorizes the probability of an input being ID into a product of conditional probabilities. This allows for a series of decoders, each focusing on recovering information lost after *each individual encoding layer*, rather than a single decoder recovering all accumulated loss.\n        *   **Normalized L2 Distance (NL2):** A novel distance metric, `NL2(f, ~f) = ||f/||f|| - ~f/||f||||`, is introduced to evaluate reconstruction accuracy. This addresses the issue that neural networks tend to produce smaller activations for OoD samples, which can lead to misleadingly small L2 reconstruction errors. NL2 normalizes the reconstruction by the input's norm, eliminating the negative influence of feature magnitude.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Theoretical Insight:** Formalization of autoencoder-based OoD detection as quadruplet domain translation and the derivation of two preconditions for valid reconstruction error as a data uncertainty measure.\n    *   **Novel Framework:** The \"layerwise semantic reconstruction\" framework, which decomposes data certainty and employs multiple decoders for incremental information recovery.\n    *   **Novel Metric:** The Normalized L2 Distance (NL2) for robust reconstruction error evaluation, addressing the norm-correlation bias.\n    *   **System Design:** Utilizing Activation Vector (AV) features from a pre-trained classifier as the reconstruction target, simplifying the autoencoder's task and improving efficiency.\n    *   **Algorithmic Strategy:** Combining latent space compression, semantic reconstruction, data certainty decomposition, and NL2 distance to achieve state-of-the-art performance.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** Comprehensive analysis, ablation studies, and robustness studies were performed.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results:** The method establishes state-of-the-art performance on various challenging benchmarks. For example, it achieves an FPR@95%TPR of 0.2% for CIFAR-100 vs. TinyImagenet-crop on a Wide-ResNet classifier.\n    *   **Key Findings:** The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, indicating that the potential of autoencoder-based methods for OoD detection is significantly higher than previously thought.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Assumptions:** The theoretical proof for NL2 relies on activation functions being approximately linear in certain polytopes. The approach assumes the availability of a pre-trained classifier to extract AV features.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The method operates in an unsupervised mode, requiring no additional OoD data, complex structures, or time-consuming pipelines. It is designed as an auxiliary module that does not harm the classification accuracy of known classes.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** \\cite{zhou202250i} significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in unsupervised OoD detection, particularly for autoencoder-based methods, by addressing their core limitations.\n    *   **Potential Impact:** The work provides a novel theoretical understanding and practical framework that can revitalize research into reconstruction-based OoD detection. Its efficiency, unsupervised nature, and strong performance without additional data make it highly impactful for real-world applications where OoD data is scarce or impossible to collect.

Evolution Analysis:\n\nThe evolution of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection research, as evidenced by these interconnected papers, showcases two prominent and intertwined trends: **1) The Granularization and Model-Aware Reframing of OOD Problem Definition and Evaluation** and **2) The Pursuit of Deeper Model Understanding and Integrated System Design for Robustness**.\n\n### Trend 1: The Granularization and Model-Aware Reframing of OOD Problem Definition and Evaluation\n\nThis trend marks a significant departure from a simplistic, binary understanding of OOD (in-distribution vs. out-of-distribution) towards a more nuanced, multi-faceted, and context-dependent definition. Initially, OOD detection primarily focused on identifying novel semantic categories. However, the limitations of this narrow view quickly became apparent.\n\n*   **Problem Evolution**: The journey began with [yang2022it3] *Full-Spectrum Out-of-Distribution Detection (2022)*, which critically identified the inconsistent handling of **covariate shift** in existing OOD literature. This paper highlighted that models were untrustworthy in real-world deployments because appearance changes (covariate shifts) were either ignored or incorrectly treated as OOD. This led to the introduction of the **Full-Spectrum OOD (FS-OOD)** problem, demanding detectors that could distinguish semantic shifts while being robust to covariate shifts. Building on this, [yang2023ckx] *ImageNet-OOD: Deciphering Modern Out-of-Distribution Detection Algorithms (2023)* exposed deeper flaws in the *evaluation* of OOD. It revealed that many ImageNet-based benchmarks, even those attempting to isolate semantic shift, suffered from ID contamination, semantic ambiguities, and unintended covariate shifts, making it difficult to truly assess what OOD algorithms were detecting. This underscored the urgent need for cleaner, more isolated evaluation of semantic shift.\n    The problem definition further evolved with [averly20239rv] *Unified Out-Of-Distribution Detection: A Model-Specific Perspective (2023)*. This work tackled the fundamental dilemma of how to treat covariate shift – as OOD or ID – by proposing that the decision should be **model-specific**, dependent on whether the *deployed model can correctly classify the example*. This unified semantic shift, covariate shift, and even misclassified in-distribution examples under a single, performance-driven definition. The most granular step came with [long2024os1] *Rethinking the Evaluation of Out-of-Distribution Detection: A Sorites Paradox (2024)*, which addressed the \"Sorites Paradox\" – the ambiguity of \"how different\" an OOD sample must be. It moved beyond binary OOD definitions to a continuous measurement of \"shift degrees\" for both semantic and covariate components. Finally, [lu2024j0n] *Out-of-Distribution Detection: A Task-Oriented Survey of Recent Advances (2024)* synthesized these evolving complexities by introducing a **task-oriented taxonomy**, acknowledging the field's maturation and the need to organize diverse OOD problems and solutions based on practical scenarios.\n\n*   **Methodological Progression**: [yang2022it3] introduced **SEM (Semantics score function)**, a feature-based score designed to disentangle semantic and non-semantic information using GMMs on different CNN layers, alongside new benchmarks. [yang2023ckx] developed a rigorous **manual curation methodology** for `ImageNet-OOD`, creating a \"clean room\" for semantic shift evaluation. [averly20239rv] proposed a **unified ground-truth labeling scheme** for MS-OOD, where every example is labeled based on the *specific deployed model's* actual classification performance. [long2024os1] introduced **LAID (Language Aligned Image feature Decomposition)**, leveraging CLIP's aligned text and image features to quantitatively decompose image features into distinct semantic and covariate components, enabling the **IS-OOD benchmark** with incremental shift levels and new correlation/sensitivity metrics. [lu2024j0n] provided a **conceptual framework** (task-oriented taxonomy) rather than a new algorithm, organizing methods into training-driven, training-agnostic, and large pre-trained model-based categories.\n\n*   **Key Innovations**: The **FS-OOD problem setting** and **SEM score function** ([yang2022it3]), the **ImageNet-OOD dataset** and its systematic curation methodology ([yang2023ckx]), the **MS-OOD framework** and its model-specific ground-truth definition ([averly20239rv]), the **IS-OOD benchmark**, **LAID feature decomposition**, and **Syn-IS dataset** for incremental shift evaluation ([long2024os1]), and the **task-oriented taxonomy** for OOD research ([lu2024j0n]).\n\n### Trend 2: The Pursuit of Deeper Model Understanding and Integrated System Design for Robustness\n\nThis trend focuses on developing more sophisticated OOD detection mechanisms by delving into the internal workings of neural networks and by integrating OOD detection with other crucial machine learning tasks, moving towards more holistic and practical AI system designs.\n\n*   **Problem Evolution**: Beyond defining and evaluating OOD, researchers sought more fundamental and practical ways to build robust OOD systems. Traditional OOD methods often lacked deep insights into *why* models failed on OOD data or operated in isolation from other crucial machine learning tasks. [liu2023zb3] *Neuron Activation Coverage: Rethinking Out-of-distribution Detection and Generalization (2023)* addressed the lack of fundamental insights into OOD root causes, arguing that existing neuron-based approaches were either too simplistic or required architectural modifications. [li2025xv2] *Outlier Synthesis via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for Out-of-Distribution Detection (2025)* tackled a practical limitation of regularization-based OOD methods (like Outlier Exposure): their heavy reliance on acquiring large pools of *real* OOD data. Existing virtual outlier synthesis methods were often poor quality, lacked diversity, or were computationally expensive. Finally, [schmidt2024syr] *A Unified Approach Towards Active Learning and Out-of-Distribution Detection (2024)* identified a critical gap in real-world deployments: Active Learning (AL) and OOD detection, though conceptually linked and practically co-occurring, were studied in isolation, leading to inefficient and suboptimal system designs.\n\n*   **Methodological Progression**: [liu2023zb3] introduced a novel **Neuron Activation State (ˆz)**, combining raw output with gradient-based influence, and then proposed **Neuron Activation Coverage (NAC)**, a statistical measure of how well neuron states are \"covered\" by InD data. This led to **NAC-UE** for state-of-the-art OOD detection and **NAC-ME** for OOD generalization evaluation. [li2025xv2] proposed **HamOS (Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Outlier Synthesis)**, which innovatively formulated outlier synthesis as sampling from Markov chains in a latent hyperspherical feature space, guided by a novel OOD-ness estimation and incorporating a hard margin barrier via KDE to ensure quality and diversity of synthetic OOD data *solely from ID data*. [schmidt2024syr] introduced **SISOM (Simultaneous Informative Sampling and Outlier Mining)**, the first unified solution for AL and OOD detection. It leveraged **gradient-enhanced feature representations**, a **distance ratio metric** (inner-to-outer class distances), and a **self-adaptive Feature Space Analysis** mechanism that dynamically weighted distance-based and uncertainty-based scores based on feature space separability.\n\n*   **Key Innovations**: The **Neuron Activation State (ˆz)** and **Neuron Activation Coverage (NAC)** for unified OOD detection and generalization ([liu2023zb3]), the **HamOS framework** for high-quality, diverse virtual outlier synthesis using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, without needing real OOD data ([li2025xv2]), and the **SISOM framework** for unifying Active Learning and OOD detection, incorporating gradient-enhanced features and self-adaptive scoring ([schmidt2024syr]).\n\n## 3. Synthesis:\n\nThe intellectual trajectory connecting these works collectively moves from a simplistic, binary understanding of Out-of-Distribution detection towards a sophisticated, multi-faceted, and context-aware approach. Their collective contribution is to redefine, rigorously evaluate, and fundamentally enhance the capabilities of AI systems to identify and manage uncertainty arising from diverse forms of unknown data, paving the way for more trustworthy and adaptable machine learning in real-world applications.",

        "abstract": "Existing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection literature clearly defines semantic shift as a sign of OOD but does not have a consensus over covariate shift. Samples experiencing covariate shift but not semantic shift from the in-distribution (ID) are either excluded from the test set or treated as OOD, which contradicts the primary goal in machine learning—being able to generalize beyond the training distribution. In this paper, we take into account both shift types and introduce full-spectrum OOD (F-OOD) detection, a more realistic problem setting that considers both detecting semantic shift and being tolerant to covariate shift; and design three benchmarks. These new benchmarks have a more fine-grained categorization of distributions ( i.e let@tokeneonedot, training ID, covariate-shifted ID, near-OOD, and far-OOD) for the purpose of more comprehensively evaluating the pros and cons of algorithms. To address the F-OOD detection problem, we propose SEM, a simple feature-based semantics score function. SEM is mainly composed of two probability measures: one is based on high-level features containing both semantic and non-semantic information, while the other is based on low-level feature statistics only capturing non-semantic image styles. With a simple combination, the non-semantic part is canceled out, which leaves only semantic information in SEM that can better handle F-OOD detection. Extensive experiments on the three new benchmarks show that SEM significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Our code and benchmarks are released in https://github.com/Jingkang50/OpenOOD .",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   The paper addresses a critical limitation in existing Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection: the lack of consensus and proper handling of **covariate shift** \\cite{yang2022it3}.\n    *   Current OOD detection literature primarily focuses on **semantic shift** (new classes) but either excludes covariate-shifted data from evaluation or incorrectly treats it as OOD.\n    *   This approach contradicts the fundamental machine learning goal of generalizing beyond the training distribution, making models untrustworthy in real-world deployments where appearance changes (e.g., lighting, viewpoint, contrast) are common.\n    *   The authors introduce **Full-Spectrum OOD (FS-OOD) detection**, a more realistic problem setting that requires detecting semantic shift while being robust and tolerant to covariate shift \\cite{yang2022it3}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   Existing OOD detection methods typically rely on score functions based on conditional probability (e.g., Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) \\cite{yang2022it3}, ODIN \\cite{yang2022it3}) or marginal probability (e.g., energy-based EBO \\cite{yang2022it3}, Mahalanobis distance \\cite{yang2022it3}, generative models \\cite{yang2022it3}).\n    *   The primary limitation of these previous solutions is their failure to effectively distinguish between semantic shift and covariate shift. As demonstrated by the authors, state-of-the-art methods like EBO perform poorly in FS-OOD scenarios, often classifying both near-OOD and far-OOD samples as in-distribution when covariate shift is present \\cite{yang2022it3}.\n    *   This work positions itself by addressing a previously uninvestigated but critical scenario for real-world applications.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   The core technical method is **SEM (Semantics score function)**, a simple feature-based score function designed to be sensitive only to semantic shift and robust to covariate shift \\cite{yang2022it3}.\n    *   SEM is formulated as `SEM(x) = log p(x) / p(xn)`, where `x` represents high-level features and `xn` represents non-semantic features.\n    *   **Novelty**: SEM leverages two probability measures:\n        *   `p(x)`: Based on high-level features from top CNN layers, capturing both semantic and non-semantic information. Modeled using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) after a variant of PCA for dimension reduction.\n        *   `p(xn)`: Based on low-level feature statistics (means and standard deviations) from shallow CNN layers, which are shown to capture non-semantic image styles. Also modeled using a GMM.\n    *   By combining these measures as a ratio, the non-semantic part is effectively \"cancelled out,\" leaving a score primarily indicative of semantic information.\n    *   **Source-Awareness Enhancement**: A fine-tuning scheme is proposed to improve the estimation of `p(xn)`. This involves using negative data augmentation (e.g., Mixup \\cite{yang2022it3}) to synthesize OOD samples. A combined loss function (`Lcls` for classification and `Lsrc` to push OOD feature statistics away while making ID feature statistics more compact) is used to enhance the model's ability to differentiate non-semantic shifts.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Problem Setting**: Introduction of the **Full-Spectrum OOD (FS-OOD) detection** problem, which considers both semantic and covariate shift for a more realistic evaluation \\cite{yang2022it3}.\n    *   **New Benchmarks**: Design of three comprehensive benchmarks (DIGITS, OBJECTS, COVID) with a fine-grained categorization of distributions: training ID, covariate-shifted ID, near-OOD, and far-OOD \\cite{yang2022it3}.\n    *   **Novel Algorithm**: Proposal of **SEM**, a simple yet effective feature-based semantics score function that explicitly disentangles semantic and non-semantic information for robust OOD detection \\cite{yang2022it3}.\n    *   **System Design**: A fine-tuning scheme incorporating negative data augmentation to enhance source-awareness in feature statistics.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Benchmarks**: Experiments were conducted on three newly designed FS-OOD benchmarks:\n        *   **DIGITS**: Based on MNIST, SVHN, USPS (covariate-shifted ID), notMNIST, FashionMNIST (near-OOD), and Texture, CIFAR-10, Tiny-ImageNet, Places365 (far-OOD).\n        *   **OBJECTS**: Based on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-10, CIFAR-10-C (covariate-shifted ID), CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet (near-OOD), and MNIST, FashionMNIST, Texture, CIFAR-100-C (far-OOD).\n        *   **COVID**: A real-world medical imaging benchmark for COVID-19 diagnosis, using BIMCV (training ID), ACTUALMED, Hannover (covariate-shifted ID), RSNA Bone Age, COVID CT (near-OOD), and MNIST, CIFAR-10, Texture, Tiny-ImageNet (far-OOD).\n    *   **Metrics**: Performance was evaluated using False Positive Rate at 95% True Positive Rate (FPR95), Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC), and Area Under the Precision-Recall curve (AUPR).\n    *   **Results**: Extensive experiments demonstrated that SEM significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art OOD detection methods across all three new benchmarks, particularly in distinguishing between covariate-shifted ID and true OOD samples \\cite{yang2022it3}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   The paper primarily highlights the limitations of *previous* OOD methods in handling covariate shift, rather than explicit limitations of SEM.\n    *   The scope of applicability is focused on **visual recognition tasks**, as evidenced by the image-based benchmarks.\n    *   The approach relies on the assumption that low-level feature statistics effectively capture non-semantic image styles, and that semantic and non-semantic features are generated independently.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   This work significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by introducing a more comprehensive and realistic OOD detection problem setting (FS-OOD) that is crucial for deploying trustworthy AI systems in real-world scenarios.\n    *   The proposed SEM score function provides a novel and effective way to disentangle semantic and non-semantic information, leading to OOD detectors that are robust to covariate shift while accurately identifying semantic shifts.\n    *   The new benchmarks provide a standardized and challenging testbed for future research in OOD detection, encouraging the development of algorithms that can generalize better and handle diverse distribution shifts.\n    *   The findings have potential impact on future research by shifting the focus towards developing OOD methods that explicitly account for different types of distribution shifts, moving beyond purely semantic-based detection.",

        "abstract": "The task of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is notoriously ill-defined. Earlier works focused on new-class detection, aiming to identify label-altering data distribution shifts, also known as\"semantic shift.\"However, recent works argue for a focus on failure detection, expanding the OOD evaluation framework to account for label-preserving data distribution shifts, also known as\"covariate shift.\"Intriguingly, under this new framework, complex OOD detectors that were previously considered state-of-the-art now perform similarly to, or even worse than the simple maximum softmax probability baseline. This raises the question: what are the latest OOD detectors actually detecting? Deciphering the behavior of OOD detection algorithms requires evaluation datasets that decouples semantic shift and covariate shift. To aid our investigations, we present ImageNet-OOD, a clean semantic shift dataset that minimizes the interference of covariate shift. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that OOD detectors are more sensitive to covariate shift than to semantic shift, and the benefits of recent OOD detection algorithms on semantic shift detection is minimal. Our dataset and analyses provide important insights for guiding the design of future OOD detectors.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \\cite{yang2023ckx} for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the ill-defined nature of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, particularly the entanglement and differential impact of \"semantic shift\" (new classes) and \"covariate shift\" (label-preserving data changes) on modern OOD detection algorithms. It questions what these algorithms are truly detecting, given their poor performance on \"failure detection\" benchmarks compared to simple baselines.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: Properly evaluating OOD detectors requires datasets that can decouple semantic and covariate shifts. Existing OOD datasets, especially those using ImageNet-1K as in-distribution (ID), suffer from significant shortcomings: ID contamination, semantic ambiguities (e.g., hypernyms/hyponyms), visual ambiguities, and the introduction of unintended covariate shifts due to diverse data sources or collection processes \\cite{yang2023ckx}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: The work positions itself against two main OOD detection paradigms: \"new-class detection\" (identifying novel categories) and \"failure detection\" (identifying misclassified examples).\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   Under the \"failure detection\" framework, complex modern OOD detectors often perform no better than, or even worse than, the simple Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) baseline \\cite{yang2023ckx}.\n        *   Many existing ImageNet-based OOD datasets (e.g., ImageNet-O, C-OOD, Species) contain ID contamination, semantic ambiguities (e.g., \"pastry dough\" being a hyponym of \"dough\"), or visual ambiguities (e.g., \"basin\" vs. \"lakeside\" images being indistinguishable) \\cite{yang2023ckx}.\n        *   Datasets using external sources like iNaturalist or SUN introduce unforeseen covariate shifts, hindering the assessment of pure semantic shift detection \\cite{yang2023ckx}.\n        *   Smaller datasets (CIFAR, MNIST) do not generalize to real-world, high-resolution, diverse scenarios \\cite{yang2023ckx}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper's core innovation is the design and construction of `ImageNet-OOD`, a novel, clean semantic shift dataset.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   `ImageNet-OOD` is manually curated from ImageNet-21K, ensuring minimal covariate shift by maintaining the same data collection process as ImageNet-1K \\cite{yang2023ckx}.\n        *   It systematically removes semantic ambiguities by excluding ImageNet-1K classes, their hypernyms, and hyponyms from the OOD set \\cite{yang2023ckx}.\n        *   It addresses inconsistencies in the WordNet hierarchy (e.g., \"Organism\" hyponyms) and mitigates \"semantically-grounded covariate shifts\" by redefining ID classes based on general decision boundaries \\cite{yang2023ckx}.\n        *   Extensive human verification (20+6 hours) was conducted to resolve visual ambiguities and filter out mislabeled images, ensuring a truly distinct OOD set \\cite{yang2023ckx}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Dataset**: Introduction of `ImageNet-OOD`, a carefully curated dataset of 31,807 images from 637 classes, specifically designed to isolate semantic shift detection from covariate shift for ImageNet-1K as ID \\cite{yang2023ckx}.\n    *   **Systematic Dataset Construction Methodology**: A robust methodology for creating clean OOD benchmarks by addressing various sources of ambiguity and contamination (semantic, visual, hierarchical, covariate) \\cite{yang2023ckx}.\n    *   **Empirical Insights**: Provides critical empirical evidence demonstrating the disproportionate sensitivity of modern OOD detectors to covariate shifts over semantic shifts \\cite{yang2023ckx}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**:\n        *   Compared OOD detection performance on `ImageNet-OOD` (semantic shift) against ImageNet-R (covariate shift) using self-supervised features (PASS dataset) to quantify visual distance to ID \\cite{yang2023ckx}.\n        *   Evaluated nine OOD detection algorithms (including MSP, Energy, ViM, ReAct) across 13 network architectures (e.g., ResNet-50) using `ImageNet-OOD` and three ImageNet-1K-based covariate shift datasets (ImageNet-C, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-Sketch) \\cite{yang2023ckx}.\n        *   Performed a sanity check by applying elementary transformations (e.g., zoom) to ID images to observe OOD score changes \\cite{yang2023ckx}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**: Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) was used as a threshold-free metric \\cite{yang2023ckx}.\n    *   **Comparison Results**:\n        *   Modern OOD detection algorithms are significantly more sensitive to covariate shifts (e.g., ImageNet-R) than to semantic shifts (`ImageNet-OOD`), even when visual distances to ID are similar \\cite{yang2023ckx}.\n        *   On `ImageNet-OOD`, which minimizes covariate shift, modern OOD algorithms show *minimal improvement* over the simple MSP baseline for new-class detection \\cite{yang2023ckx}.\n        *   The observed performance gains of modern OOD algorithms on previous benchmarks are often due to their ability to ignore *incorrectly classified ID examples* rather than effectively detecting true OOD examples, leading to a disparity between new-class and failure detection tasks \\cite{yang2023ckx}.\n        *   For instance, a simple zoom on an ImageNet-1K \"Ostrich\" image, which didn't change the model's correct classification, drastically decreased the OOD ranking of ViM and ReAct scores by 38.4% and 39.6% respectively, highlighting their sensitivity to minor covariate shifts \\cite{yang2023ckx}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**: The dataset construction, while thorough, is labor-intensive due to manual

In this paper, we present a novel, unifying framework to study OOD detection in a broader scope.

We show that this framework unifies the detection of OOD examples caused by semantic shift and covariate shift, and closely addresses the concern of applying a machine learning model to uncontrolled environments.

        "title": "Neuron Activation Coverage: Rethinking Out-of-distribution Detection and Generalization",
        "abstract": "The out-of-distribution (OOD) problem generally arises when neural networks encounter data that significantly deviates from the training data distribution, i.e., in-distribution (InD). In this paper, we study the OOD problem from a neuron activation view. We first formulate neuron activation states by considering both the neuron output and its influence on model decisions. Then, to characterize the relationship between neurons and OOD issues, we introduce the \\textit{neuron activation coverage} (NAC) -- a simple measure for neuron behaviors under InD data. Leveraging our NAC, we show that 1) InD and OOD inputs can be largely separated based on the neuron behavior, which significantly eases the OOD detection problem and beats the 21 previous methods over three benchmarks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K). 2) a positive correlation between NAC and model generalization ability consistently holds across architectures and datasets, which enables a NAC-based criterion for evaluating model robustness. Compared to prevalent InD validation criteria, we show that NAC not only can select more robust models, but also has a stronger correlation with OOD test performance.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** The paper addresses the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) problem, where neural networks encounter data significantly different from their training (in-distribution, InD) data, leading to performance degradation. It specifically tackles both OOD detection (identifying OOD inputs) and OOD generalization (building models robust to OOD data).\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** The OOD problem is prevalent in real-world applications, as the assumption of identical training and test data distributions rarely holds. Existing OOD solutions often lack fundamental insights into the root causes and mitigation strategies. Prior neuron-based approaches either modify network architectures (potentially harming InD accuracy) or oversimplify neuron states, discarding valuable distributional information \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** This work relates to two main categories of OOD research: OOD detection methods (e.g., OpenMax, ODIN, ViM) and OOD generalization techniques.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:** The paper argues that existing methods often fail to provide deep insights into the fundamental causes of OOD issues. Specifically, previous neuron-centric studies either involve network modifications that can compromise classification ability or rely on simplistic binary neuron activation states, which lose crucial information about neuron behavior distributions \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:**\n        *   **Neuron Activation State (ˆz):** The paper first formulates a novel neuron activation state `ˆz` by considering both the neuron's raw output (`z`) and its influence on model decisions. This influence is quantified using gradients derived from the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the network's output and a uniform vector. This formulation effectively combines the neuron's contribution to predictions (similar to `Input⊙Gradient`) with the model's confidence in the input data \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n        *   **Neuron Activation Coverage (NAC):** Inspired by coverage analysis in system testing, NAC is introduced as a simple statistical measure. It quantifies the \"coverage degree\" of neuron states under InD training data by deriving a function from the probability density function (PDF) of `ˆz`. A higher NAC score for a neuron state indicates it is frequently activated by InD data, suggesting fewer underlying defects in that state \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n        *   **NAC for Uncertainty Estimation (NAC-UE):** For OOD detection, NAC-UE directly averages the NAC scores across all neurons for a given test sample. OOD data is hypothesized to trigger abnormal neuron behaviors, resulting in lower average NAC scores, which serve as an uncertainty measure \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n        *   **NAC for Model Evaluation (NAC-ME):** For OOD generalization, NAC-ME measures model robustness by integrating the coverage distribution of all neurons. The hypothesis is that a larger coverage area (higher integral of NAC distribution) correlates with increased network robustness \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n    *   **Novelty:** The primary innovation lies in rethinking OOD problems from a neuron activation perspective, introducing a sophisticated yet interpretable formulation of neuron activation state, and proposing NAC as a novel, statistically grounded measure to characterize neuron behavior. This allows for a unified approach to both OOD detection and generalization, leveraging insights from software testing \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Formulation of Neuron Activation State:** A new method to define neuron activation (`ˆz`) that incorporates both raw output and its influence on model decisions via KL divergence gradients, capturing both neuron contribution and model confidence \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n    *   **Introduction of Neuron Activation Coverage (NAC):** A novel statistical measure that quantifies how well neuron states are \"covered\" by in-distribution training data, providing a direct indicator of potential defects or abnormal behavior \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n    *   **Algorithmic Frameworks for OOD Tasks:** Development of NAC-UE for state-of-the-art OOD detection and NAC-ME for robust OOD generalization evaluation, both built upon the NAC concept \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insight:** The establishment of a positive correlation between NAC and model generalization ability, providing a principled criterion for evaluating model robustness \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **OOD Detection (NAC-UE):**\n        *   **Experiments:** Evaluated on three benchmarks: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1k, using various OOD datasets (e.g., MNIST, SVHN, Textures, Places365, iNaturalist, OpenImage-O).\n        *   **Models:** ResNet-18 (for CIFAR), ResNet-50, and Vit-b16 (for ImageNet).\n        *   **Metrics:** FPR95 (False Positive Rate at 95% True Positive Rate) and AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve).\n        *   **Key Results:** NAC-UE achieved new state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming 21 previous best OOD detection methods. For instance, on CIFAR-100, it showed a 10.60% improvement on FPR95 and a 4.58% gain on AUROC over the competitive ViM. The NAC function was efficiently built using less than 5% of the InD training set \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n    *   **OOD Generalization (NAC-ME):**\n        *   **Experiments:** Conducted on DomainBed.\n        *   **Key Results:** Demonstrated a consistent positive correlation between NAC and model generalization ability across different architectures and datasets. NAC-ME was shown to select more robust models and exhibited an 11.61% stronger rank correlation with OOD test accuracy (on Vit-b16) compared to prevalent InD validation criteria \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations:** The effectiveness of NAC depends on the choice of the parameter `r` (lower bound for full coverage), which needs careful tuning to avoid dominance by noisy activations or vulnerability to data biases. The current implementation uses a histogram-based approximation for PDF, which might have implications for very fine-grained distributions \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The research primarily focuses on multi-class image classification tasks. While the underlying neuron-centric concepts are general, direct applicability and performance in other domains (e.g., natural language processing, time series) or different model architectures (e.g., generative models) would require further investigation.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art:** Significantly pushes the state-of-the-art in OOD detection, providing a highly effective and interpretable method.\n    *   **Novel Conceptual Framework:** Introduces a novel, neuron-centric framework for understanding and addressing OOD problems, offering a deeper insight into how models behave under distribution shifts \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n    *   **Unified Solution:** Provides a unified approach (NAC) that is applicable to both OOD detection and OOD generalization, suggesting a common underlying mechanism for these challenges.\n    *   **Impact on Future Research:** Opens new avenues for research in model robustness, interpretability, and generalization by focusing on the statistical properties of neuron activation patterns, potentially leading to more principled and robust AI systems \\cite{liu2023zb3}.",

        "abstract": "Most existing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection benchmarks classify samples with novel labels as the OOD data. However, some marginal OOD samples actually have close semantic contents to the in-distribution (ID) sample, which makes determining the OOD sample a Sorites Paradox. In this paper, we construct a benchmark named Incremental Shift OOD (IS-OOD) to address the issue, in which we divide the test samples into subsets with different semantic and covariate shift degrees relative to the ID dataset. The data division is achieved through a shift measuring method based on our proposed Language Aligned Image feature Decomposition (LAID). Moreover, we construct a Synthetic Incremental Shift (Syn-IS) dataset that contains high-quality generated images with more diverse covariate contents to complement the IS-OOD benchmark. We evaluate current OOD detection methods on our benchmark and find several important insights: (1) The performance of most OOD detection methods significantly improves as the semantic shift increases; (2) Some methods like GradNorm may have different OOD detection mechanisms as they rely less on semantic shifts to make decisions; (3) Excessive covariate shifts in the image are also likely to be considered as OOD for some methods.

        "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for developing trustworthy and reliable machine learning systems. Recent advances in training with auxiliary OOD data demonstrate efficacy in enhancing detection capabilities. Nonetheless, these methods heavily rely on acquiring a large pool of high-quality natural outliers. Some prior methods try to alleviate this problem by synthesizing virtual outliers but suffer from either poor quality or high cost due to the monotonous sampling strategy and the heavy-parameterized generative models. In this paper, we overcome all these problems by proposing the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Outlier Synthesis (HamOS) framework, which views the synthesis process as sampling from Markov chains. Based solely on the in-distribution data, the Markov chains can extensively traverse the feature space and generate diverse and representative outliers, hence exposing the model to miscellaneous potential OOD scenarios. The Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with sampling acceptance rate almost close to 1 also makes our framework enjoy great efficiency. By empirically competing with SOTA baselines on both standard and large-scale benchmarks, we verify the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed HamOS.",

Existing virtual outlier synthesis methods often suffer from either poor quality, lack of diversity and representativeness, or high computational cost due to monotonous sampling strategies or heavy-parameterized generative models.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: OOD detection is crucial for developing trustworthy and reliable machine learning systems, especially in safety-critical applications (e.g., autonomous driving, medical imaging) where erroneous predictions on unknown data can lead to perilous situations. The challenge lies in efficiently synthesizing diverse and representative virtual outliers using *only* in-distribution (ID) data to effectively train models to distinguish between ID and OOD samples, without requiring real OOD examples.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: \\cite{li2025xv2} positions itself within regularization-based OOD detection methods, specifically those that enhance models' discriminative ability during training. It builds upon the idea of synthesizing virtual outliers to overcome the limitations of Outlier Exposure (OE) methods, which require meticulously gathered natural OOD data.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   **Outlier Exposure (OE)**: Heavily relies on acquiring a large pool of high-quality natural outliers, which is often infeasible or expensive for many domain-specific applications.\n        *   **Prior Virtual Outlier Synthesis**:\n            *   Methods generating outliers in pixel space (e.g., using GANs) are computationally expensive due to generative models.\n            *   Methods generating outliers in feature space (e.g., Gaussian sampling) often impose stringent assumptions on ID data or exclusively sample from sub-regions near decision boundaries. This leads to synthesized outliers that lack diversity and representativeness, which are crucial for effective OOD learning.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: \\cite{li2025xv2} proposes the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Outlier Synthesis (HamOS) framework. HamOS formulates the outlier synthesis process as sampling from Markov chains in a latent hyperspherical feature space, based solely on ID data.\n        *   It employs a novel **OOD-ness estimation** function, defined as the average Euclidean distance to the k-th nearest neighbors of two adjacent ID clusters. The potential energy for HMC is set as the negative logarithm of this OOD-ness.\n        *   **Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)**, specifically Spherical HMC, is used to generate a sequence of diverse and representative virtual outliers by traversing the feature space efficiently.\n        *   **Hard Margin Barrier**: To prevent erroneous outlier synthesis (i.e., generating outliers within ID clusters), \\cite{li2025xv2} introduces a hard margin in the HMC acceptance step, based on kernel density estimation (KDE) with a von Mises-Fisher kernel to approximate ID probability.\n        *   **Training**: The model is trained with a dual-head framework, utilizing an ID contrastive loss and an OOD discernment loss to learn a proper hyperspherical space that enhances ID-OOD separation.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   **First to use Markov chains for outlier synthesis**: Unlike previous methods that rely on Gaussian sampling or complex generative models, \\cite{li2025xv2} introduces a paradigm shift by explicitly sampling through Markov chains.\n        *   **Efficient and Diverse Sampling**: HMC's ability to traverse long distances in state space with high acceptance rates allows for the generation of diverse and representative outliers across a broad range of OOD characteristics and regions in the hyperspherical space.\n        *   **Solely ID-data based**: Achieves high-quality outlier synthesis without any auxiliary OOD data.\n        *   **Integrated OOD-ness and ID-likelihood**: Combines OOD-ness estimation with an ID probability-based hard margin to ensure synthesized outliers are both OOD-like and distinct from ID clusters.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**:\n        *   Introduction of a new framework for outlier synthesis via Markov chains, specifically using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, as an alternative to Gaussian sampling or generative models.\n        *   A novel OOD-ness estimation method based on k-nearest neighbor distances in hyperspherical space to guide outlier generation.\n        *   Integration of a hard margin barrier, calculated via kernel density estimation with the von Mises-Fisher kernel, into the HMC acceptance step to reject erroneous outliers within ID clusters.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: A dual-head training framework that projects feature embeddings into a reduced-dimensional hyperspherical space for outlier synthesis, while maintaining an FC head for original ID classification.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: Demonstrates that by formulating outlier synthesis as sampling from Markov chains with an OOD-ness potential energy, diverse and representative outliers can be efficiently generated, exposing the model to miscellaneous potential OOD scenarios.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Extensive empirical analysis was performed on both standard and large-scale OOD detection benchmarks.\n        *   Standard benchmarks: CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 (with five standard OOD test datasets).\n        *   Large-scale benchmark: ImageNet-1K.\n        *   Ablation studies were conducted to elucidate the intrinsic mechanism of \\cite{li2025xv2}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   **SOTA Performance**: \\cite{li2025xv2} significantly surpasses competitive baselines (both virtual outlier synthesis methods like VOS, NPOS, and regularization methods like ODINE, Energy, CSI) on all tested benchmarks.\n        *   **FPR95**: Achieved substantial improvements in FPR95 (False Positive Rate at 95% True Positive Rate for ID data). Specifically, it enhanced FPR95 on CIFAR-10 by 27.17% and on CIFAR-100 by 5.96%.\n        *   **AUROC**: Figure 1 indicates superior AUROC performance on ImageNet-1K compared to baselines.\n        *   **Diversity**: Figure 2 and Figure 4(b) demonstrate that \\cite{li2025xv2} generates outliers with a broader range of OOD scores and higher variance, indicating greater diversity. Figure 4(c) shows synthesized outliers have diverse OOD scores and low ID-likelihood.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**:\n        *   The effectiveness relies on the quality of the learned hyperspherical feature space and the accuracy of the OOD-ness estimation based on ID data distances.\n        *   The choice of hyperparameters for HMC (e.g., Leapfrog steps, step size) and the hard margin threshold `δ` can influence synthesis quality.\n        *   While efficient, HMC still involves iterative numerical approximations, which might have computational implications compared to simpler Gaussian noise injection, though \\cite{li2025xv2} claims great efficiency due to high acceptance rates.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: \\cite{li2025xv2} is a general framework compatible with various HMC variants, ID contrastive losses, and scoring functions. It is primarily applicable to scenarios where acquiring natural OOD data is difficult or impossible, and where OOD detection is critical for system reliability.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: \\cite{li2025xv2} establishes a new state-of-the-art in OOD detection by introducing a novel and effective paradigm for virtual outlier synthesis. It addresses a critical bottleneck in OOD-aware training by providing a method to generate diverse and representative outliers without relying on external OOD data.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n        *   Opens new avenues for exploring advanced sampling algorithms (beyond Gaussian distributions) for outlier synthesis in feature space.\n        *   Could inspire further research into more sophisticated OOD-ness estimation functions and adaptive hard margin strategies.\n        *   The framework's compatibility with various components suggests potential for integration with other OOD detection techniques and adaptation to different domain-specific challenges.\n        *   Contributes significantly to the development of more trustworthy and reliable machine learning systems by improving their ability to handle unknown inputs.",

        "title": "A Unified Approach Towards Active Learning and Out-of-Distribution Detection",
        "abstract": "When applying deep learning models in open-world scenarios, active learning (AL) strategies are crucial for identifying label candidates from a nearly infinite amount of unlabeled data. In this context, robust out-of-distribution (OOD) detection mechanisms are essential for handling data outside the target distribution of the application. However, current works investigate both problems separately. In this work, we introduce SISOM as the first unified solution for both AL and OOD detection. By leveraging feature space distance metrics SISOM combines the strengths of the currently independent tasks to solve both effectively. We conduct extensive experiments showing the problems arising when migrating between both tasks. In these evaluations SISOM underlined its effectiveness by achieving first place in two of the widely used OpenOOD benchmarks and second place in the remaining one. In AL, SISOM outperforms others and delivers top-1 performance in three benchmarks",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \"A Unified Approach Towards Active Learning and Out-of-Distribution Detection\" by Schmidt et al. for a literature review:\n\n*   **CITATION**: \\cite{schmidt2024syr}\n\n---\n\n### Focused Summary for Literature Review\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** Deep learning models in open-world scenarios face two critical, yet separately addressed, challenges: (1) the need for vast amounts of labeled data (addressed by Active Learning - AL) and (2) unpredictable behavior when encountering data outside the training distribution (Out-of-Distribution - OOD detection) \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** Both AL and OOD detection are crucial for robust real-world applications (e.g., mobile robotic perception). While they share common underlying metrics (uncertainty, latent space distances), current research investigates them in isolation. A simple migration of methods between tasks is ineffective due to domain-specific challenges (e.g., OOD training schemes, AL batch diversification). The paper argues for a unified approach, as real-world applications frequently necessitate concurrent consideration of both problems \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:**\n        *   **Active Learning (AL):** Existing AL methods primarily focus on pool-based scenarios, selecting samples based on prediction uncertainty (e.g., Monte Carlo Dropout, ensembles), latent space diversity (e.g., CoreSet, coverage-based), or auxiliary models (e.g., loss estimation, autoencoders) \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n        *   **Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Detection:** OOD detection encompasses various techniques, including preprocessing (e.g., data augmentation) and postprocessing methods. Postprocessing includes logit-based approaches (e.g., energy scores, temperature scaling), and methods relying on feature space distances (e.g., Mahalanobis distance, k-NN) or gradients \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:** The primary limitation is the \"disentanglement\" of AL and OOD detection. No existing method has been designed or tested for both scenarios simultaneously, despite their conceptual connections and practical co-occurrence in real-world applications \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method (SISOM - Simultaneous Informative Sampling and Outlier Mining):** \\cite{schmidt2024syr}\n        *   **Unified Solution:** SISOM is introduced as the first unified solution for both AL and OOD detection, leveraging enriched feature space distance metrics.\n        *   **Coverage:** Employs neural coverage techniques by concatenating latent spaces from multiple layers to identify unexplored regions (for diversity in AL or OOD samples) and decision boundary regions (for refining AL and detecting near-OOD).\n        *   **Feature Enhancement:** Enriches feature representations by weighting neurons based on their gradient contribution to the KL divergence between a uniform distribution and the model's softmax output. This gradient acts as a saliency weighting, prioritizing influential neurons.\n        *   **Distance Ratio:** Computes a ratio of inner-class distance (minimal distance to a known sample of the same pseudo-class) to outer-class distance (minimal distance to a known sample of a different pseudo-class) in the gradient-enhanced feature space. This guides sample selection towards decision boundaries and unexplored regions. A representative subset of labeled samples is used for efficiency.\n        *   **Feature Space Analysis:** Introduces a self-deciding process that combines the distance ratio score with an uncertainty-based energy score. The weighting between these two scores is dynamically determined by `ravg`, the average distance ratio of known samples, which estimates the separability of the feature space. If `ravg` is high (poor separation), the energy score is prioritized; if low (good separation), the distance ratio is prioritized.\n        *   **Sigmoid Steepness (Optional):** Allows for further refinement of feature space representations by introducing a layer-wise steepness parameter `αj` for the sigmoid function used in Feature Enhancement, which can be optimized to minimize `ravg(α)`.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:** SISOM is novel as the first unified approach to AL and OOD detection. It innovatively combines neural coverage, gradient-based feature weighting, a refined distance ratio metric, and a self-adaptive mechanism (Feature Space Analysis) to robustly handle varying feature space separability \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods:**\n        *   **SISOM:** A novel unified framework for Simultaneous Informative Sampling and Outlier Mining, addressing both AL and OOD detection \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n        *   **Gradient-enhanced feature representation:** A technique that weights neuron activations based on their contribution to KL divergence, improving feature saliency for both tasks \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n        *   **Distance Ratio metric:** A refined metric leveraging inner-to-outer class distances in the enhanced feature space for precise sample selection and outlier identification \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n        *   **Feature Space Analysis:** A self-deciding process that dynamically combines distance-based and uncertainty-based scores, adapting to the separability of the feature space \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n        *   **Sigmoid Steepness optimization:** An optional method to fine-tune feature representations for improved separability \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations:** Proposes a compound framework that integrates the AL training phase and the OOD detection operation phase, illustrating their concurrent application in real-world scenarios \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis:** Explores the fundamental connection between AL and OOD detection, demonstrating that a simple migration of methods is insufficient and a unified approach is beneficial. It also highlights the dependence of feature space metrics on latent space separation \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** Extensive experiments were conducted to assess SISOM's performance on both AL and OOD detection tasks individually. The AL evaluation used the standard pool-based scenario, while OOD detection followed the OpenOOD benchmarking framework. The paper also investigated the problems arising from migrating methods between tasks \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results:**\n        *   **OOD Detection:** SISOM achieved first place in two of the widely used OpenOOD benchmarks and second place in the remaining one \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n        *   **Active Learning:** SISOM outperformed other methods, delivering top-1 performance in three benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in AL \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n        *   Comparisons were made against several AL baselines (e.g., CoreSet, Badge) and an adapted OOD method (NAC) for AL \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The performance of feature space metrics, including SISOM's distance ratio, is highly dependent on a \"well-defined latent space\" with good feature separation. The computational cost of distance calculations is mitigated by using a representative subset of labeled samples \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The approach is primarily designed for deep learning models in open-world scenarios, with evaluations conducted on image classification tasks using standard AL and OpenOOD benchmarks \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art:** SISOM represents a significant advancement by introducing the first unified solution for AL and OOD detection, addressing a critical gap in current research. Its state-of-the-art performance in both domains demonstrates the effectiveness of this integrated approach \\cite{schmidt2024syr}. The self-adaptive Feature Space Analysis mechanism enhances practical robustness \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:** This work opens new research avenues for developing combined AL and OOD detection strategies, moving beyond their traditional separate investigation.

    "seed_title": "Deep Residual Flow for Out of Distribution Detection",
    "summary": "**Integration Analysis:**\n\nThe addition of ten new papers from 2024-2025 significantly enriches and diversifies the evolutionary narrative of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. While reinforcing the previously identified trends of \"Deeper Introspection into Model Internals for Robust Uncertainty Estimation\" (Trend 1) and \"Towards Principled and Theoretically-Backed Methodologies\" (Trend 2), these new contributions also introduce several critical new directions and conceptual shifts.\n\n**How new papers relate to previously identified trends:**\n\n*   **Reinforcing and Deepening Trend 1 (Deeper Introspection):** Many new papers continue to explore and refine internal model mechanisms. [li2025xv2] and [wang2025xwm] delve into generating synthetic OOD data by manipulating latent spaces, extending the idea of internal feature manipulation from [zhu2022oir]. [wu20242p3] explicitly structures feature space based on Neural Collapse, while [fang2024lv2] applies Kernel PCA with non-linear mappings to features, both building on the feature-level analysis seen in [gomes2022zyv] and [lafon2023w37]. [chen2024kl7] introduces fine-grained neuron/parameter pruning, a novel form of internal model intervention. [shin2024lnf] leverages representation norms, and [liu20245e5] uses hierarchical contexts from VLMs, demonstrating more sophisticated ways to derive OOD signals from model internals.\n*   **Strengthening and Expanding Trend 2 (Principled/Theoretically-Backed):** This trend is significantly bolstered. [novello2024yco] directly builds on [kaur2022cty]'s use of Conformal Prediction by extending its guarantees to OOD *evaluation metrics*. [vishwakarma2024z1m] provides *adaptive, real-time FPR guarantees* for deployment, a crucial practical extension. [du2024aea] offers a fundamental theoretical analysis of the role of ID labels, providing provable error bounds. These works collectively push for more rigorous, certifiable, and deployable OOD systems.\n\n**New methodological or conceptual shifts:**\n\n*   **Emerging Trend 3: OOD Synthesis and Exposure without External OOD Data:** A significant new direction is the focus on generating high-quality synthetic OOD samples *solely from in-distribution (ID) data* to facilitate OOD exposure training. [wang2025xwm] introduces implicit adversarial latent generation for graphs, and [li2025xv2] uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for diverse outlier synthesis in feature space. This addresses a major practical bottleneck of OOD exposure methods.\n*   **Emerging Trend 4: Practical Deployment and Evaluation Guarantees:** Beyond just designing OOD scores, the field is now heavily focused on *how to reliably evaluate and deploy* OOD detectors in real-world, dynamic, and safety-critical settings. [novello2024yco] introduces \"conformal\" evaluation metrics, and [vishwakarma2024z1m] proposes an adaptive, human-in-the-loop framework with guaranteed FPR control.\n*   **Emerging Trend 5: Unified Approaches and Interdisciplinary Connections:** OOD detection is increasingly being integrated with other machine learning challenges. [schmidt2024syr] proposes a unified framework for Active Learning (AL) and OOD detection, recognizing their shared underlying principles. [du2024aea] formally bridges anomaly detection and OOD detection. [liu20245e5] leverages large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and prompt tuning, indicating integration with foundation models.\n*   **Task-Oriented Perspective:** [lu2024j0n], as a survey, introduces a novel \"task-oriented taxonomy,\" which itself represents a conceptual shift in how the field is organized and understood, moving beyond purely methodological classifications.\n\n**Gaps filled or new directions opened:**\n\n*   **Data Scarcity for OOD Exposure:** [wang2025xwm] and [li2025xv2] directly address the critical problem of lacking real OOD data for effective OOD-aware training, particularly for complex data like graphs.\n*   **Reliable Evaluation:** [novello2024yco] fills the gap of statistically rigorous evaluation metrics for OOD detection, moving beyond empirical approximations.\n*   **Adaptive Deployment:** [vishwakarma2024z1m] provides a solution for adaptive OOD thresholding with guarantees, crucial for safety-critical applications where static thresholds fail.\n*   **Interconnected ML Problems:** [schmidt2024syr] and [du2024aea] open new avenues for research by demonstrating the benefits of unifying OOD detection with AL and formally connecting it to anomaly detection, respectively.\n*   **Leveraging Foundation Models:** [liu20245e5] explores the use of VLMs for OOD, a new frontier in OOD detection.\n*   **Specialized OOD Challenges:** [shin2024lnf] addresses the specific and challenging scenario of OOD detection in long-tailed learning, a practical limitation not explicitly covered before.\n\n**Connections between new papers and earlier works:**\n\n*   [novello2024yco] directly extends the theoretical guarantees of Conformal Prediction introduced by [kaur2022cty].\n*   [li2025xv2], [wang2025xwm], [wu20242p3], [fang2024lv2], [shin2024lnf], [chen2024kl7], and [liu20245e5] all build upon the foundational idea of leveraging and manipulating internal model features/neurons for OOD detection, as initiated by [gomes2022zyv] and further explored by [zhu2022oir] and [lafon2023w37].\n*   [du2024aea]'s theoretical analysis of ID labels provides a deeper understanding for many existing OOD methods that implicitly or explicitly use ID labels.\n\n**Overall narrative change:**\n\nThe overall narrative shifts from primarily focusing on *designing better OOD scores* to a more holistic view encompassing *data generation for OOD training*, *rigorous evaluation*, *guaranteed deployment*, and *integration with broader ML paradigms*. The field is maturing, moving towards more robust, practical, and theoretically-sound solutions for OOD detection in complex, real-world scenarios.\n\n---\n\n**Updated Evolution Analysis:**\n\nThe evolution of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection research, now encompassing fifteen papers from 2022-2025, reveals a dynamic landscape characterized by a deepening understanding of model internals, a relentless pursuit of theoretical guarantees, and the emergence of new paradigms addressing practical challenges and interdisciplinary connections.\n\n### Trend 1: Deeper Introspection into Model Internals for Robust Uncertainty Estimation\n\n*   *Methodological progression*: This trend has significantly expanded, moving from analyzing latent features to actively manipulating them and even individual neurons. [gomes2022zyv] (2022) initiated this by using Information Geometry on latent features. [zhu2022oir] (2022) then proposed *rectifying* extreme features with TrBN. The new papers push this further: [li2025xv2] (2025) introduces **Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for synthesizing diverse virtual outliers** in a *hyperspherical feature space* from ID data, a sophisticated internal feature manipulation. Similarly, [wang2025xwm] (2025) proposes **implicit adversarial latent generation for graph OOD detection**, creating pseudo-OOD samples in the latent space without external data. [wu20242p3] (2024) leverages **Neural Collapse** to explicitly separate ID and OOD features into *orthogonal subspaces*, a principled way to structure the feature space. [fang2024lv2] (2024) enhances feature-space analysis by applying **Kernel PCA with explicit non-linear mappings** (Cosine, Cosine-Gaussian) to achieve better separability, building on the idea of feature transformation. [shin2024lnf] (2024) introduces **Representation Norm Amplification (RNA)**, actively manipulating the norm of representation vectors to create a new OOD detection dimension, especially for long-tail learning. [chen2024kl7] (2024) delves into the most granular level, proposing **Optimal Parameter and Neuron Pruning (OPNP)** based on gradient sensitivity to reduce overconfidence. Finally, [liu20245e5] (2024) leverages **Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and prompt tuning to construct hierarchical contexts** (perceptual and spurious) for precise category descriptions, integrating external knowledge with internal model adaptation.\n*   *Problem evolution*: Initially addressing general DNN unreliability, this trend now tackles more nuanced problems. [zhu2022oir] identified \"extreme features.\" [li2025xv2] and [wang2025xwm] address the critical problem of *lacking real OOD data for effective OOD exposure training*. [wu20242p3] tackles the limitation of previous OOD exposure methods that only focus on output separation, arguing for *feature space separation*. [shin2024lnf] addresses the *conflicting goals of ID classification and OOD detection in long-tailed datasets*. [chen2024kl7] aims to improve post-hoc OOD detection by leveraging prior information from training data *without requiring OOD samples or retraining*. [liu20245e5] focuses on constructing *precise category descriptions* in VLMs, particularly for semantically similar OOD samples, and enabling *category extensibility*.\n*   *Key innovations*: [li2025xv2]'s HMC outlier synthesis and [wang2025xwm]'s implicit adversarial generation are breakthroughs for OOD data scarcity. [wu20242p3]'s Separation Loss based on Neural Collapse and [fang2024lv2]'s efficient KPCA with explicit non-linear mappings offer powerful feature-space manipulation. [shin2024lnf]'s RNA provides a novel decoupling strategy for long-tail OOD. [chen2024kl7]'s OPNP offers a training-free, gradient-based pruning for OOD. [liu20245e5]'s hierarchical contexts and perturbation-guided spurious synthesis in VLMs represent a new frontier.\n*   *Integration points*: These new papers directly build on the feature-level analysis of [gomes2022zyv] and the feature manipulation of [zhu2022oir], extending these ideas to more complex data generation, explicit feature structuring, and fine-grained model interventions.\n\n### Trend 2: Towards Principled and Theoretically-Backed Methodologies\n\n*   *Methodological progression*: This trend has evolved from introducing mathematical frameworks to providing rigorous guarantees for both detection and evaluation, and fundamental theoretical insights. [gomes2022zyv] introduced Information Geometry, and [kaur2022cty] (2022) made a landmark by integrating Conformal Prediction (CP) for *rigorous theoretical guarantees on false detection rates*. This is significantly expanded by [novello2024yco] (2024), which advocates for and demonstrates using CP to provide *provably conservative guarantees on OOD evaluation metrics* like AUROC and FPR, moving beyond empirical approximations. [vishwakarma2024z1m] (2024) introduces a **mathematically grounded human-in-the-loop framework for adaptive thresholding** with *anytime-valid Upper Confidence Bounds (UCBs)* based on the Law of Iterated Logarithm, guaranteeing FPR control in dynamic environments. [du2024aea] (2024) provides a **formal analytical framework based on graph theory and spectral decomposition** to understand *when and how ID labels help OOD detection*, offering provable error bounds.\n*   *Problem evolution*: The initial problem was the lack of reliability and interpretability. [kaur2022cty] directly addressed the absence of *guaranteed* false detection rates. [novello2024yco] tackles the unreliability of empirical OOD evaluation metrics due to finite sample sizes. [vishwakarma2024z1m] addresses the critical practical problem of *unacceptably high False Positive Rates (FPR)* in real-world OOD deployment and the need for adaptive, guaranteed control in safety-critical applications. [du2024aea] fills a fundamental theoretical gap by rigorously exploring the impact of ID labels, especially for \"near OOD\" scenarios.\n*   *Key innovations*: [novello2024yco]'s \"conformal AUROC\" and \"conformal FPR\" provide statistically rigorous evaluation. [vishwakarma2024z1m]'s LIL-based UCB for adaptive thresholding offers guaranteed FPR control in dynamic settings. [du2024aea]'s graph-theoretic framework and provable error bounds offer fundamental insights into the role of ID labels.\n*   *Integration points*: [novello2024yco] directly extends the Conformal Prediction framework introduced by [kaur2022cty], moving from detection guarantees to evaluation guarantees. The theoretical underpinnings of [du2024aea] provide a deeper understanding for many existing OOD methods.\n\n### Trend 3: Unified Approaches and Interdisciplinary Connections (New Trend)\n\n*   *Methodological progression*: This new trend reflects the field's maturity, moving beyond isolated problem-solving to integrating OOD detection with other critical ML tasks and advanced models. [schmidt2024syr] (2024) introduces **SISOM (Simultaneous Informative Sampling and Outlier Mining)**, the first **unified solution for Active Learning (AL) and OOD detection**, leveraging enriched feature space distance metrics and a self-adaptive mechanism. [lu2024j0n] (2024), a survey, introduces a **novel task-oriented taxonomy** for OOD detection, which itself is a methodological contribution for organizing the field, especially for emerging paradigms like test-time adaptation and large pre-trained models.\n*   *Problem evolution*: This trend addresses the \"disentanglement\" of related ML problems. [schmidt2024syr] tackles the practical need for concurrent AL and OOD detection in real-world applications (e.g., robotics). [lu2024j0n] addresses the lack of a comprehensive, task-oriented overview of the rapidly evolving OOD field.\n*   *Key innovations*: [schmidt2024syr]'s SISOM framework is a groundbreaking unified solution, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both AL and OOD. [lu2024j0n]'s task-oriented taxonomy provides a crucial conceptual framework for navigating the field.\n*   *Integration points*: This trend represents a significant branching, showing how OOD is no longer a standalone problem but is increasingly integrated into broader ML systems and theoretical understandings.\n\n---\n\n**Refined Synthesis:**\n\nThe expanded view of OOD detection reveals a powerful intellectual trajectory that has matured from heuristic scoring to a robust, theoretically grounded science. The field now not only deeply introspects and manipulates model internals for precise uncertainty estimation but also rigorously pursues theoretical guarantees for both detection and evaluation, while simultaneously innovating in data synthesis and integrating OOD solutions with other critical machine learning paradigms. This collective contribution is transforming OOD detection into a cornerstone for building truly reliable, certifiable, and adaptable AI systems capable of operating safely in complex, open-world environments.",

HEAT complements prior density estimators of the ID density, e.g. parametric models like the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), to provide an accurate yet robust density estimation. A second contribution is to leverage the EBM framework to provide a unified density estimation and to compose several energy terms. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significance of the two contributions.

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review:\n\n### Focused Summary for Literature Review\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific technical problem**: The paper addresses the critical challenge of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection for deep neural networks \\cite{lafon2023w37}.\n    *   **Importance and challenge**: OOD detection is a major safety requirement for deploying deep learning models in critical applications (e.g., healthcare, autonomous systems) to prevent arbitrary or unreliable predictions when encountering data outside the training distribution. State-of-the-art deep neural networks often struggle with this, and post-hoc strategies, which leverage pre-trained models, are preferred for real-world applicability and computational efficiency \\cite{lafon2023w37}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to existing approaches**: This work builds upon existing post-hoc OOD detection methods that estimate the density of in-distribution (ID) features in the latent space of a pre-trained network \\cite{lafon2023w37}. These include approaches based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) \\cite{lafon2023w37}, nearest neighbors \\cite{lafon2023w37}, and energy logits (EL) \\cite{lafon2023w37}.\n    *   **Limitations of previous solutions**:\n        *   Existing methods often exhibit biases, performing well on either \"far-OOD\" (e.g., GMMs) or \"near-OOD\" (e.g., EL) but struggling with the other, leading to coarse boundaries between ID and OOD \\cite{lafon2023w37}.\n        *   Some methods, like Outlier Exposure, rely on external OOD samples, which are difficult to collect representatively and can bias the detector \\cite{lafon2023w37}.\n        *   Energy-Based Models (EBMs) for OOD detection have not yet matched the performance of feature-space methods \\cite{lafon2023w37}.\n        *   Prior residual learning approaches (e.g., ResFlow, ViM) have limitations such as requiring invertible mappings (for Normalizing Flows) or modeling residuals on linear manifolds, which limit their expressive power \\cite{lafon2023w37}.\n        *   Ensembling multiple networks, while effective, incurs significant computational overhead at inference time \\cite{lafon2023w37}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core technical method**: The paper introduces HEAT (Hybrid Energy Based Model in the Feature Space), a novel post-hoc OOD detection method \\cite{lafon2023w37}. HEAT estimates the density of ID samples by employing hybrid EBMs in the feature space of a fixed, pre-trained backbone network \\cite{lafon2023w37}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   **Energy-based correction of prior OOD detectors**: HEAT refines existing prior density estimators (e.g., GMMs, EL) by complementing them with a data-driven residual EBM. This allows for accurate and robust ID density estimation, leveraging the generalization properties of priors while correcting their inherent modeling biases \\cite{lafon2023w37}.\n        *   **Hybrid density estimation via energy function composition**: The EBM framework is used to provide a unified density estimation and to compose several energy terms from different refined priors. This composition requires only a single hyper-parameter ($\\beta$) and introduces no computational overhead at inference, as it's applied at a single network layer \\cite{lafon2023w37}.\n        *   Unlike some prior residual methods, HEAT learns a non-linear residual, enhancing ID density modeling \\cite{lafon2023w37}.\n        *   HEAT does not require any OOD samples for training, relying solely on proper EBM training to estimate ID feature density \\cite{lafon2023w37}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel algorithms, methods, or techniques**:\n        *   **Hybrid EBM density estimation**: A novel formulation `ph_θk(z) = (1/Z(θk)) * pr_θk(z) * qk(z)` where `qk(z)` is a prior density and `pr_θk(z)` is a residual EBM `exp(-Eθk(z))`. This results in a hybrid energy `Eh_θk(z) = Eqk(z) + Eθk(z)` \\cite{lafon2023w37}.\n        *   **Controlled residual learning**: An additional loss term `LC(θk)` is introduced to prevent the residual EBM from overly dominating the prior, ensuring a balanced cooperation between the prior and the residual. The total loss is `LTot(θk) = LMLE(θk) + λLC(θk)` \\cite{lafon2023w37}.\n        *   **EBM-based composition function**: A principled composition function `Eβ_HEAT = (1/β) * log(Σ_k exp(β * Eh_θk))` is proposed to combine multiple refined hybrid energies, with `β` offering a clear interpretation (e.g., sum of energies, logsumexp) \\cite{lafon2023w37}.\n    *   **System design or architectural innovations**: HEAT operates as a post-hoc method in the feature space of a pre-trained model, applying its energy-based correction and composition at a single network layer, ensuring computational efficiency \\cite{lafon2023w37}.\n    *   **Theoretical insights or analysis**: The EBM framework provides a sound theoretical basis for both the residual correction and the composition of energy functions, offering a principled way to combine different OOD detection signals \\cite{lafon2023w37}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments conducted**: Extensive experiments were performed on standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and the large-scale ImageNet dataset \\cite{lafon2023w37}. The method was validated using ResNet-34 (for CIFAR) and ResNet-50 (for ImageNet) backbones, demonstrating its agnosticism to the prediction backbone (e.g., ResNet, ViT) and effectiveness in low-data regimes \\cite{lafon2023w37}.\n    *   **Key performance metrics and comparison results**: The performance was evaluated using standard metrics: Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and False Positive Rate at 95% True Positive Rate (FPR95) \\cite{lafon2023w37}.\n        *   HEAT achieved new state-of-the-art OOD detection results on CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100 and ImageNet \\cite{lafon2023w37}.\n        *   Illustrative results (Fig. 1) show significant improvements: GMM's FPR on near-OOD reduced by -4.7 percentage points, and EL's FPR on near-OOD by -3.2 pts and far-OOD by -1.2 pts after energy-correction. The final HEAT composition further improved detection for both near and far-OOD regimes \\cite{lafon2023w37}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical limitations or assumptions**: The method requires prior OOD scorers to be expressible as EBMs and differentiable to facilitate Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) sampling during training \\cite{lafon2023w37}. Extending HEAT to other state-of-the-art OOD detectors (e.g., soft-KNN, ViM) is noted as future work \\cite{lafon2023w37}.\n    *   **Scope of applicability**: HEAT is a post-hoc OOD detection method designed for the feature space of pre-trained deep neural networks. It is applicable across various backbone architectures and remains effective even in low-data scenarios, without requiring external OOD samples for training \\cite{lafon2023w37}.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances the technical state-of-the-art**: HEAT sets new state-of-the-art OOD detection performance on major benchmarks, demonstrating its superior ability to handle both near and far-OOD samples simultaneously \\cite{lafon2023w37}.\n    *   **Potential impact on future research**: The proposed hybrid EBM framework, with its principled energy-based correction and composition strategy, offers a versatile and efficient approach to combine and refine existing OOD detectors. This could inspire future research into more robust and adaptable OOD detection methods, particularly for critical real-world applications where reliable uncertainty estimation is paramount \\cite{lafon2023w37}.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning methods such as deep neural networks (DNNs), despite their success across different domains, are known to often generate incorrect predictions with high confidence on inputs outside their training distribution. The deployment of DNNs in safety-critical domains requires detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) data so that DNNs can abstain from making predictions on those. A number of methods have been recently developed for OOD detection, but there is still room for improvement. We propose the new method iDECODe, leveraging in-distribution equivariance for conformal OOD detection. It relies on a novel base non-conformity measure and a new aggregation method, used in the inductive conformal anomaly detection framework, thereby guaranteeing a bounded false detection rate. We demonstrate the efficacy of iDECODe by experiments on image and audio datasets, obtaining state-of-the-art results. We also show that iDECODe can detect adversarial examples.

        "title": "Neuron Activation Coverage: Rethinking Out-of-distribution Detection and Generalization",
        "abstract": "The out-of-distribution (OOD) problem generally arises when neural networks encounter data that significantly deviates from the training data distribution, i.e., in-distribution (InD). In this paper, we study the OOD problem from a neuron activation view. We first formulate neuron activation states by considering both the neuron output and its influence on model decisions. Then, to characterize the relationship between neurons and OOD issues, we introduce the \\textit{neuron activation coverage} (NAC) -- a simple measure for neuron behaviors under InD data. Leveraging our NAC, we show that 1) InD and OOD inputs can be largely separated based on the neuron behavior, which significantly eases the OOD detection problem and beats the 21 previous methods over three benchmarks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K). 2) a positive correlation between NAC and model generalization ability consistently holds across architectures and datasets, which enables a NAC-based criterion for evaluating model robustness. Compared to prevalent InD validation criteria, we show that NAC not only can select more robust models, but also has a stronger correlation with OOD test performance.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** The paper addresses the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) problem, where neural networks encounter data significantly different from their training (in-distribution, InD) data, leading to performance degradation. It specifically tackles both OOD detection (identifying OOD inputs) and OOD generalization (building models robust to OOD data).\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** The OOD problem is prevalent in real-world applications, as the assumption of identical training and test data distributions rarely holds. Existing OOD solutions often lack fundamental insights into the root causes and mitigation strategies. Prior neuron-based approaches either modify network architectures (potentially harming InD accuracy) or oversimplify neuron states, discarding valuable distributional information \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** This work relates to two main categories of OOD research: OOD detection methods (e.g., OpenMax, ODIN, ViM) and OOD generalization techniques.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:** The paper argues that existing methods often fail to provide deep insights into the fundamental causes of OOD issues. Specifically, previous neuron-centric studies either involve network modifications that can compromise classification ability or rely on simplistic binary neuron activation states, which lose crucial information about neuron behavior distributions \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:**\n        *   **Neuron Activation State (ˆz):** The paper first formulates a novel neuron activation state `ˆz` by considering both the neuron's raw output (`z`) and its influence on model decisions. This influence is quantified using gradients derived from the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the network's output and a uniform vector. This formulation effectively combines the neuron's contribution to predictions (similar to `Input⊙Gradient`) with the model's confidence in the input data \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n        *   **Neuron Activation Coverage (NAC):** Inspired by coverage analysis in system testing, NAC is introduced as a simple statistical measure. It quantifies the \"coverage degree\" of neuron states under InD training data by deriving a function from the probability density function (PDF) of `ˆz`. A higher NAC score for a neuron state indicates it is frequently activated by InD data, suggesting fewer underlying defects in that state \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n        *   **NAC for Uncertainty Estimation (NAC-UE):** For OOD detection, NAC-UE directly averages the NAC scores across all neurons for a given test sample. OOD data is hypothesized to trigger abnormal neuron behaviors, resulting in lower average NAC scores, which serve as an uncertainty measure \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n        *   **NAC for Model Evaluation (NAC-ME):** For OOD generalization, NAC-ME measures model robustness by integrating the coverage distribution of all neurons. The hypothesis is that a larger coverage area (higher integral of NAC distribution) correlates with increased network robustness \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n    *   **Novelty:** The primary innovation lies in rethinking OOD problems from a neuron activation perspective, introducing a sophisticated yet interpretable formulation of neuron activation state, and proposing NAC as a novel, statistically grounded measure to characterize neuron behavior.

        "abstract": "Despite graph neural networks' (GNNs) great success in modelling graph-structured data, out-of-distribution (OOD) test instances still pose a great challenge for current GNNs. One of the most effective techniques to detect OOD nodes is to expose the detector model with an additional OOD node-set, yet the extra OOD instances are often difficult to obtain in practice. Recent methods for image data address this problem using OOD data synthesis, typically relying on pre-trained generative models like Stable Diffusion. However, these approaches require vast amounts of additional data, as well as one-for-all pre-trained generative models, which are not available for graph data. Therefore, we propose the GOLD framework for graph OOD detection, an implicit adversarial learning pipeline with synthetic OOD exposure without pre-trained models. The implicit adversarial training process employs a novel alternating optimisation framework by training: (1) a latent generative model to regularly imitate the in-distribution (ID) embeddings from an evolving GNN, and (2) a GNN encoder and an OOD detector to accurately classify ID data while increasing the energy divergence between the ID embeddings and the generative model's synthetic embeddings. This novel approach implicitly transforms the synthetic embeddings into pseudo-OOD instances relative to the ID data, effectively simulating exposure to OOD scenarios without auxiliary data. Extensive OOD detection experiments are conducted on five benchmark graph datasets, verifying the superior performance of GOLD without using real OOD data compared with the state-of-the-art OOD exposure and non-exposure baselines.",

This addresses the finite-sample fluctuation problem of p-values and FPR.\n        2.  **OOD Scores for CP Improvement**: It explores using sophisticated OOD scores (e.g., Mahalanobis distance, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) distance) as non-conformity scores within the CP framework to build more effective prediction sets.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   **Guaranteed Conservativeness**: The introduction of `conformal AUROC` and `conformal FPR` provides a novel way to evaluate OOD detectors with high-probability conservative guarantees, a significant departure from purely empirical metrics.\n        *   **Cross-Pollination**: It explicitly advocates for and demonstrates the mutual benefits of intertwining OOD and CP, showing how each field can enhance the other, rather than treating them as separate domains.\n        *   **Enhanced Non-conformity Scores**: By leveraging advanced OOD scores as non-conformity scores, it moves beyond traditional simple scores in CP, opening new avenues for CP score crafting.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   Casting the OOD detection problem into the framework of statistical hypothesis testing and applying `\\cite{bates2022}`'s ideas to correct OOD scores.\n    *   Proposing new `conformal AUROC` and `conformal FPR` metrics, which are provably conservative with high probability (1-δ).\n    *   Building new, more involved non-conformity scores for CP based on existing OOD scores (e.g., Mahalanobis, KNN).\n    *   Highlighting and experimentally demonstrating the inherent intertwining and potential for cross-fertilization between OOD detection (designing scores) and Conformal Prediction (interpreting scores).\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**:\n        *   Demonstrated the fluctuations of p-values and FPR due to finite calibration dataset size using the SVHN extra dataset, showing that empirical approximations can be overly optimistic.\n        *   Applied the proposed `conformal AUROC` and `conformal FPR` corrections to two reference OOD and anomaly detection benchmarks.\n        *   Conducted an experimental comparison of prediction set performance using OOD-based non-conformity scores against classical CP non-conformity scores.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   The effect of `conformal AUROC` and `conformal FPR` was shown on the **OpenOOD `\\cite{yang2022}`** and **ADBench `\\cite{han2022}`** benchmarks, demonstrating their ability to provide conservative estimates.\n        *   For CP, it was found that OOD scores like **Mahalanobis** and **KNN** are good candidates for non-conformity scores. Specifically, the **Mahalanobis score was shown to outperform classical non-conformity scores** in building prediction sets for classification tasks.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The conservativeness guarantees of the new conformal metrics come at the expense of some approximation precision. The marginal p-values are provably valid but depend on the choice of the calibration dataset, and the correction aims to provide guarantees *conditional* on the calibration set with high probability.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The methods are broadly applicable to any OOD score and can enhance the reliability of OOD detection in various ML pipelines, particularly in safety-critical contexts. The CP improvement aspect is demonstrated for classification tasks but could potentially extend to other ML tasks.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: This work significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by introducing a statistically rigorous framework for evaluating OOD detection performance with probabilistic guarantees, moving beyond potentially optimistic empirical metrics. It also enriches the Conformal Prediction field by demonstrating the utility of advanced OOD scores as non-conformity measures.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: The paper's core message—that OOD and CP are inherently intertwined—opens a large avenue for future research. It encourages cross-fertilization between the two fields, potentially leading to more robust OOD detectors, more efficient CP methods, and a deeper understanding of uncertainty quantification in ML.

        "abstract": "Robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is crucial for safely deploying machine learning models in the open world. Recent works have focused on designing scoring functions to quantify OOD uncertainty. Setting appropriate thresholds for these scoring functions for OOD detection is challenging as OOD samples are often unavailable up front. Typically, thresholds are set to achieve a desired true positive rate (TPR), e.g., $95\\%$ TPR. However, this can lead to very high false positive rates (FPR), ranging from 60 to 96\\%, as observed in the Open-OOD benchmark. In safety-critical real-life applications, e.g., medical diagnosis, controlling the FPR is essential when dealing with various OOD samples dynamically. To address these challenges, we propose a mathematically grounded OOD detection framework that leverages expert feedback to \\emph{safely} update the threshold on the fly. We provide theoretical results showing that it is guaranteed to meet the FPR constraint at all times while minimizing the use of human feedback. Another key feature of our framework is that it can work with any scoring function for OOD uncertainty quantification. Empirical evaluation of our system on synthetic and benchmark OOD datasets shows that our method can maintain FPR at most $5\\%$ while maximizing TPR.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   The paper addresses the critical problem of **Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection** in machine learning models, particularly the challenge of safely deploying these models in real-world, open-world settings \\cite{vishwakarma2024z1m}.\n    *   The core issue is that existing OOD detection methods, which rely on scoring functions and static thresholds, often lead to **unacceptably high False Positive Rates (FPR)** (e.g., 60-96% in Open-OOD benchmark) when thresholds are set to achieve a desired True Positive Rate (TPR, e.g., 95%).\n    *   This problem is important because high FPR can have catastrophic consequences in safety-critical applications (e.g., medical diagnosis, autonomous driving), where misclassifying an OOD sample as in-distribution (ID) is more dangerous than deferring to a human.\n    *   The challenge is exacerbated by the dynamic nature of OOD samples encountered after deployment, making static thresholds ineffective and requiring adaptive mechanisms that can guarantee FPR control while minimizing human intervention.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   Existing OOD detection methods primarily focus on designing scoring functions and are largely limited to **static settings** where thresholds are set a priori using ID data \\cite{vishwakarma2024z1m}.\n    *   These previous solutions often fail to guarantee FPR control in dynamic environments where OOD data distributions can vary, leading to highly fluctuating and often high FPRs.\n    *   The work positions itself as **complementary** to existing scoring function development, focusing instead on a framework for safely adapting the detection threshold on the fly, rather than proposing a new scoring function.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   The core technical method is a **mathematically grounded human-in-the-loop OOD detection framework** that adaptively updates the detection threshold (`ˆλt`) over time \\cite{vishwakarma2024z1m}.\n    *   **Adaptive Threshold Estimation**: The system uses human expert feedback on a subset of samples to estimate the FPR and adjust the threshold.\n    *   **Importance Sampling**: To obtain an unbiased estimate of FPR and detect distribution shifts, human feedback is solicited for all points declared OOD, and with a small probability `p` for points declared ID.\n    *   **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) for FPR**: The framework constructs an anytime-valid UCB (`ψ(t, δ)`) on the estimated FPR, based on the **Law of Iterated Logarithm (LIL)** for martingales. This UCB is crucial for ensuring safety by providing a high-probability upper bound on the true FPR.\n    *   **Threshold Optimization**: At each time `t`, the threshold `ˆλt` is chosen by solving `arg min λ s.t. dFPR(λ, t) + ψ(t, δ) ≤ α`, where `dFPR(λ, t)` is the unbiased empirical FPR estimate, `ψ(t, δ)` is the LIL-based UCB, and `α` is the desired maximum FPR.

        "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for developing trustworthy and reliable machine learning systems. Recent advances in training with auxiliary OOD data demonstrate efficacy in enhancing detection capabilities. Nonetheless, these methods heavily rely on acquiring a large pool of high-quality natural outliers. Some prior methods try to alleviate this problem by synthesizing virtual outliers but suffer from either poor quality or high cost due to the monotonous sampling strategy and the heavy-parameterized generative models. In this paper, we overcome all these problems by proposing the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Outlier Synthesis (HamOS) framework, which views the synthesis process as sampling from Markov chains. Based solely on the in-distribution data, the Markov chains can extensively traverse the feature space and generate diverse and representative outliers, hence exposing the model to miscellaneous potential OOD scenarios. The Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with sampling acceptance rate almost close to 1 also makes our framework enjoy great efficiency.

        "title": "A Unified Approach Towards Active Learning and Out-of-Distribution Detection",
        "abstract": "When applying deep learning models in open-world scenarios, active learning (AL) strategies are crucial for identifying label candidates from a nearly infinite amount of unlabeled data. In this context, robust out-of-distribution (OOD) detection mechanisms are essential for handling data outside the target distribution of the application. However, current works investigate both problems separately. In this work, we introduce SISOM as the first unified solution for both AL and OOD detection. By leveraging feature space distance metrics SISOM combines the strengths of the currently independent tasks to solve both effectively. We conduct extensive experiments showing the problems arising when migrating between both tasks. In these evaluations SISOM underlined its effectiveness by achieving first place in two of the widely used OpenOOD benchmarks and second place in the remaining one. In AL, SISOM outperforms others and delivers top-1 performance in three benchmarks",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \"A Unified Approach Towards Active Learning and Out-of-Distribution Detection\" by Schmidt et al. for a literature review:\n\n*   **CITATION**: \\cite{schmidt2024syr}\n\n---\n\n### Focused Summary for Literature Review\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** Deep learning models in open-world scenarios face two critical, yet separately addressed, challenges: (1) the need for vast amounts of labeled data (addressed by Active Learning - AL) and (2) unpredictable behavior when encountering data outside the training distribution (Out-of-Distribution - OOD detection) \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** Both AL and OOD detection are crucial for robust real-world applications (e.g., mobile robotic perception). While they share common underlying metrics (uncertainty, latent space distances), current research investigates them in isolation. A simple migration of methods between tasks is ineffective due to domain-specific challenges (e.g., OOD training schemes, AL batch diversification). The paper argues for a unified approach, as real-world applications frequently necessitate concurrent consideration of both problems \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:**\n        *   **Active Learning (AL):** Existing AL methods primarily focus on pool-based scenarios, selecting samples based on prediction uncertainty (e.g., Monte Carlo Dropout, ensembles), latent space diversity (e.g., CoreSet, coverage-based), or auxiliary models (e.g., loss estimation, autoencoders) \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n        *   **Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Detection:** OOD detection encompasses various techniques, including preprocessing (e.g., data augmentation) and postprocessing methods. Postprocessing includes logit-based approaches (e.g., energy scores, temperature scaling), and methods relying on feature space distances (e.g., Mahalanobis distance, k-NN) or gradients \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:** The primary limitation is the \"disentanglement\" of AL and OOD detection. No existing method has been designed or tested for both scenarios simultaneously, despite their conceptual connections and practical co-occurrence in real-world applications \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method (SISOM - Simultaneous Informative Sampling and Outlier Mining):** \\cite{schmidt2024syr}\n        *   **Unified Solution:** SISOM is introduced as the first unified solution for both AL and OOD detection, leveraging enriched feature space distance metrics.\n        *   **Coverage:** Employs neural coverage techniques by concatenating latent spaces from multiple layers to identify unexplored regions (for diversity in AL or OOD samples) and decision boundary regions (for refining AL and detecting near-OOD).\n        *   **Feature Enhancement:** Enriches feature representations by weighting neurons based on their gradient contribution to the KL divergence between a uniform distribution and the model's softmax output. This gradient acts as a saliency weighting, prioritizing influential neurons.\n        *   **Distance Ratio:** Computes a ratio of inner-class distance (minimal distance to a known sample of the same pseudo-class) to outer-class distance (minimal distance to a known sample of a different pseudo-class) in the gradient-enhanced feature space. This guides sample selection towards decision boundaries and unexplored regions. A representative subset of labeled samples is used for efficiency.\n        *   **Feature Space Analysis:** Introduces a self-deciding process that combines the distance ratio score with an uncertainty-based energy score. The weighting between these two scores is dynamically determined by `ravg`, the average distance ratio of known samples, which estimates the separability of the feature space. If `ravg` is high (poor separation), the energy score is prioritized; if low (good separation), the distance ratio is prioritized.\n        *   **Sigmoid Steepness (Optional):** Allows for further refinement of feature space representations by introducing a layer-wise steepness parameter `αj` for the sigmoid function used in Feature Enhancement, which can be optimized to minimize `ravg(α)`.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:** SISOM is novel as the first unified approach to AL and OOD detection. It innovatively combines neural coverage, gradient-based feature weighting, a refined distance ratio metric, and a self-adaptive mechanism (Feature Space Analysis) to robustly handle varying feature space separability \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods:**\n        *   **SISOM:** A novel unified framework for Simultaneous Informative Sampling and Outlier Mining, addressing both AL and OOD detection \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n        *   **Gradient-enhanced feature representation:** A technique that weights neuron activations based on their contribution to KL divergence, improving feature saliency for both tasks \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n        *   **Distance Ratio metric:** A refined metric leveraging inner-to-outer class distances in the enhanced feature space for precise sample selection and outlier identification \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n        *   **Feature Space Analysis:** A self-deciding process that dynamically combines distance-based and uncertainty-based scores, adapting to the separability of the feature space \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n        *   **Sigmoid Steepness optimization:** An optional method to fine-tune feature representations for improved separability \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations:** Proposes a compound framework that integrates the AL training phase and the OOD detection operation phase, illustrating their concurrent application in real-world scenarios \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis:** Explores the fundamental connection between AL and OOD detection, demonstrating that a simple migration of methods is insufficient and a unified approach is beneficial. It also highlights the dependence of feature space metrics on latent space separation \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** Extensive experiments were conducted to assess SISOM's performance on both AL and OOD detection tasks individually. The AL evaluation used the standard pool-based scenario, while OOD detection followed the OpenOOD benchmarking framework. The paper also investigated the problems arising from migrating methods between tasks \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results:**\n        *   **OOD Detection:** SISOM achieved first place in two of the widely used OpenOOD benchmarks and second place in the remaining one \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n        *   **Active Learning:** SISOM outperformed other methods, delivering top-1 performance in three benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in AL \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n        *   Comparisons were made against several AL baselines (e.g., CoreSet, Badge) and an adapted OOD method (NAC) for AL \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The performance of feature space metrics, including SISOM's distance ratio, is highly dependent on a \"well-defined latent space\" with good feature separation. The computational cost of distance calculations is mitigated by using a representative subset of labeled samples \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The approach is primarily designed for deep learning models in open-world scenarios, with evaluations conducted on image classification tasks using standard AL and OpenOOD benchmarks \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art:** SISOM represents a significant advancement by introducing the first unified solution for AL and OOD detection, addressing a critical gap in current research. Its state-of-the-art performance in both domains demonstrates the effectiveness of this integrated approach \\cite{schmidt2024syr}. The self-adaptive Feature Space Analysis mechanism enhances practical robustness \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:** This work opens new research avenues for developing combined AL and OOD detection strategies, moving beyond their traditional separate investigation. It encourages further exploration of dynamic feature space adaptation and the interplay between data selection and anomaly detection for more robust and efficient deep learning deployments in real-world settings \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.",

        "title": "Pursuing Feature Separation based on Neural Collapse for Out-of-Distribution Detection",
        "abstract": "In the open world, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data, whose labels are disjoint with those of in-distribution (ID) samples, is important for reliable deep neural networks (DNNs). To achieve better detection performance, one type of approach proposes to fine-tune the model with auxiliary OOD datasets to amplify the difference between ID and OOD data through a separation loss defined on model outputs. However, none of these studies consider enlarging the feature disparity, which should be more effective compared to outputs. The main difficulty lies in the diversity of OOD samples, which makes it hard to describe their feature distribution, let alone design losses to separate them from ID features. In this paper, we neatly fence off the problem based on an aggregation property of ID features named Neural Collapse (NC). NC means that the penultimate features of ID samples within a class are nearly identical to the last layer weight of the corresponding class. Based on this property, we propose a simple but effective loss called Separation Loss, which binds the features of OOD data in a subspace orthogonal to the principal subspace of ID features formed by NC. In this way, the features of ID and OOD samples are separated by different dimensions. By optimizing the feature separation loss rather than purely enlarging output differences, our detection achieves SOTA performance on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks without any additional data augmentation or sampling, demonstrating the importance of feature separation in OOD detection.

Existing methods that use auxiliary OOD datasets primarily focus on amplifying differences in the *output space*, neglecting the *feature space*. Designing effective feature separation losses for diverse OOD samples is difficult due to their varied and dispersed feature distributions.\n\n*   **2. Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation**: This work builds upon methods that utilize auxiliary OOD datasets to fine-tune models, such as Outlier Exposure (OE) \\cite{wu20242p3} and Energy-based methods \\cite{wu20242p3}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Previous approaches (e.g., OE, Energy method) primarily focus on increasing the *output discrepancy* between ID and OOD samples.

This ensures ID and OOD features are separated by different dimensions.\n    *   **Loss Formulation**: The `LSep` calculates the average absolute value of the cosine similarity between normalized OOD features and the normalized weights of the final FC layer, aiming to minimize this to zero.\n    *   **Assistant Loss**: An additional \"Clustering Loss\" (`LClu`) is introduced for ID data, encouraging ID features within a class to align closely with their corresponding FC weight, thereby promoting the Neural Collapse phenomenon and making ID features more clustered.\n    *   **Overall Objective**: The final training objective combines standard cross-entropy for ID data, Outlier Exposure loss for auxiliary OOD data, and the proposed `LClu` and `LSep` losses.\n\n*   **4.

        "abstract": "Detecting data points deviating from the training distribution is pivotal for ensuring reliable machine learning. Extensive research has been dedicated to the challenge, spanning classical anomaly detection techniques to contemporary out-of-distribution (OOD) detection approaches. While OOD detection commonly relies on supervised learning from a labeled in-distribution (ID) dataset, anomaly detection may treat the entire ID data as a single class and disregard ID labels. This fundamental distinction raises a significant question that has yet to be rigorously explored: when and how does ID label help OOD detection? This paper bridges this gap by offering a formal understanding to theoretically delineate the impact of ID labels on OOD detection. We employ a graph-theoretic approach, rigorously analyzing the separability of ID data from OOD data in a closed-form manner. Key to our approach is the characterization of data representations through spectral decomposition on the graph. Leveraging these representations, we establish a provable error bound that compares the OOD detection performance with and without ID labels, unveiling conditions for achieving enhanced OOD detection. Lastly, we present empirical results on both simulated and real datasets, validating theoretical guarantees and reinforcing our insights.

        "abstract": "The key to OOD detection has two aspects: generalized feature representation and precise category description. Recently, vision-language models such as CLIP provide significant advances in both two issues, but constructing precise category descriptions is still in its infancy due to the absence of unseen categories. This work introduces two hierarchical contexts, namely perceptual context and spurious context, to carefully describe the precise category boundary through automatic prompt tuning. Specifically, perceptual contexts perceive the inter-category difference (e.g., cats vs apples) for current classification tasks, while spurious contexts further identify spurious (similar but exactly not) OOD samples for every single category (e.g., cats vs panthers, apples vs peaches). The two contexts hierarchically construct the precise description for a certain category, which is, first roughly classifying a sample to the predicted category and then delicately identifying whether it is truly an ID sample or actually OOD. Moreover, the precise descriptions for those categories within the vision-language framework present a novel application: CATegory-EXtensible OOD detection (CATEX). One can efficiently extend the set of recognizable categories by simply merging the hierarchical contexts learned under different sub-task settings. And extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate CATEX's effectiveness, robustness, and category-extensibility. For instance, CATEX consistently surpasses the rivals by a large margin with several protocols on the challenging ImageNet-1K dataset.

It sought a more robust and unified metric for OOD detection.\n*   **Innovations/Capabilities:**\n    *   First work to apply information geometry tools, particularly the Fisher-Rao distance, to devise a unified metric for OOD detection.\n    *   Developed a flexible framework (IGEOOD) that works with any pre-trained neural network and adapts to various levels of model access (softmax outputs, latent features).\n    *   Provided explicit characterizations of the Fisher-Rao distance for softmax probabilities and multivariate Gaussian PDFs (under diagonal covariance assumption).\n\n**2. [kaur2022cty] iDECODe: In-distribution Equivariance for Conformal Out-of-distribution Detection (2022)**\n\n*   **Methodological/Conceptual Shift:** Shifted from geometric distances in feature/output space to leveraging the model's inherent *in-distribution equivariance* property, integrated within the Inductive Conformal Anomaly Detection (ICAD) framework. This introduced a critical focus on providing *rigorous theoretical guarantees* on false detection rates, a significant conceptual advancement for OOD detection.\n*   **Problems Addressed:** Directly addressed the lack of theoretical guarantees on false detection rates in existing OOD methods, which is a major impediment for deploying DNNs in safety-critical domains. It also aimed to improve robustness by aggregating multiple non-conformity signals.\n*   **Innovations/Capabilities:**\n    *   Proposed a novel Non-Conformity Measure (NCM) based on the error in in-distribution equivariance with respect to a set of transformations.\n    *   Introduced an innovative aggregation method to combine multiple NCM scores, derived from different transformations, into a single, more robust score.\n    *   Provided a formal theoretical guarantee (Theorem 1 and Corollary 1) demonstrating a bounded false detection rate, a crucial property for trustworthy AI.\n    *   Showcased effectiveness in detecting adversarial examples, extending its utility beyond general OOD.\n\n**3. [zhu2022oir] Boosting Out-of-distribution Detection with Typical Features (2022)**\n\n*   **Methodological/Conceptual Shift:** Introduced a novel perspective focusing on *internal feature rectification* based on \"typicality\" within the deep feature space, rather than solely on designing new OOD scores or relying on external OOD data. It proposed a plug-and-play module to modify features *before* OOD scoring.\n*   **Problems Addressed:** Identified that \"extreme features\" (those residing in low-probability regions of deep feature space) lead to ambiguity and imprecise uncertainty estimation, causing an underestimation of the reject region in OOD detection. This was an overlooked internal model mechanism.\n*   **Innovations/Capabilities:**\n    *   Proposed \"Batch Normalization Assisted Typical Set Estimation (BATS)\" and the \"Truncated BN (TrBN)\" unit as a concise and effective method to rectify extreme features to the boundaries of their typical set.\n    *   Provided a theoretical analysis of the bias-variance trade-off introduced by feature rectification, grounding the approach in statistical principles.\n    *   Demonstrated the ability to boost the performance of various existing OOD scoring functions, making it a general enhancement tool for post-hoc methods.\n\n**4. [liu2023zb3] Neuron Activation Coverage: Rethinking Out-of-distribution Detection and Generalization (2023)**\n\n*   **Methodological/Conceptual Shift:** Introduced a deep \"rethinking\" of OOD problems from a *neuron activation perspective*, moving beyond feature-level or output-level analysis to a more granular, interpretable understanding of internal model behavior. It proposed a *unified framework* (NAC) for both OOD detection and OOD generalization, a significant conceptual expansion.\n*   **Problems Addressed:** Argued that existing OOD solutions often lack fundamental insights into the root causes of OOD issues. It criticized prior neuron-centric studies for either modifying network architectures (potentially harming InD accuracy) or oversimplifying neuron states, losing valuable distributional information.\n*   **Innovations/Capabilities:**\n    *   Novel formulation of \"Neuron Activation State (ˆz)\" that combines a neuron's raw output with its gradient-based influence on model decisions, capturing both contribution and confidence.\n    *   Introduction of \"Neuron Activation Coverage (NAC)\" as a novel statistical measure quantifying how well neuron states are \"covered\" by in-distribution training data, indicating potential abnormal behavior.\n    *   Developed NAC-UE for state-of-the-art OOD detection and NAC-ME for robust OOD generalization evaluation, both built upon the NAC concept, offering a unified solution.\n    *   Established a positive correlation between NAC and model generalization ability, providing a principled criterion for evaluating model robustness.\n\n**5. [lafon2023w37] Hybrid Energy Based Model in the Feature Space for Out-of-Distribution Detection (2023)**\n\n*   **Methodological/Conceptual Shift:** Introduced a *hybrid Energy-Based Model (EBM)* framework to *refine and compose* existing OOD detectors in the feature space. This represents a shift towards leveraging the strengths of multiple prior detectors and systematically correcting their inherent biases with a data-driven residual component, offering a principled way to combine diverse OOD signals.\n*   **Problems Addressed:** Addressed the inherent biases of existing post-hoc OOD detectors (e.g., GMMs, EL) that often perform well on either \"far-OOD\" or \"near-OOD\" but struggle with the other, leading to coarse boundaries. It also aimed to avoid reliance on external OOD samples and overcome limitations of prior residual learning methods (e.g., requiring invertible mappings or modeling on linear manifolds).\n*   **Innovations/Capabilities:**\n    *   Novel hybrid EBM formulation for density estimation, `ph_θk(z) = (1/Z(θk)) * pr_θk(z) * qk(z)`, where `qk(z)` is a prior density and `pr_θk(z)` is a residual EBM.\n    *   Introduced \"controlled residual learning\" with an additional loss term `LC(θk)` to ensure a balanced cooperation between the prior and the residual EBM.\n    *   Proposed a principled EBM-based composition function `Eβ_HEAT` to combine multiple refined hybrid energies, offering a unified and efficient approach.\n    *   Achieved new state-of-the-art OOD detection results by effectively handling both near and far-OOD samples simultaneously without requiring OOD samples for training.\n\n---\n\n*Evolution Analysis:*\n\nThe evolution of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection research, as traced through these five papers from 2022-2023, reveals two prominent and interconnected trends: a shift towards **deeper introspection into model internals for robust uncertainty estimation** and a concurrent drive for **principled, theoretically-backed methodologies**.\n\n### Trend 1: Deeper Introspection into Model Internals for Robust Uncertainty Estimation\n\n*   *Methodological progression*: Early OOD detection methods often relied on superficial signals like softmax probabilities. This trend shows a clear progression towards analyzing and manipulating the internal representations and behaviors of deep neural networks to derive more robust OOD scores. [gomes2022zyv] \"Igeood: An Information Geometry Approach to Out-of-Distribution Detection\" (2022) initiated this by applying information geometry to latent features (in its white-box setting), measuring dissimilarity between feature distributions. This was a step beyond simple Euclidean distances, suggesting a more sophisticated understanding of feature space. Building on this, [zhu2022oir] \"Boosting Out-of-distribution Detection with Typical Features\" (2022) introduced a direct intervention at the feature level, proposing to \"rectify\" extreme features into a \"typical set\" using a Truncated Batch Normalization (TrBN) unit. This marked a shift from merely *observing* features to *modifying* them to improve OOD scoring. The most profound introspection came with [liu2023zb3] \"Neuron Activation Coverage: Rethinking Out-of-distribution Detection and Generalization\" (2023), which moved beyond feature vectors to individual *neuron activation states*. This paper formulated a novel neuron activation state that considers both raw output and its influence on model decisions, leading to a granular, interpretable measure of \"coverage.\" Finally, [lafon2023w37] \"Hybrid Energy Based Model in the Feature Space for Out-of-Distribution Detection\" (2023) further refined feature-space methods by introducing a hybrid Energy-Based Model (EBM) to correct biases in existing prior density estimators, effectively learning a non-linear residual on top of existing feature-space signals.\n\n*   *Problem evolution*: The initial problem was the general unreliability of DNNs on OOD data. [gomes2022zyv] aimed for a unified, robust metric across various model access levels. [zhu2022oir] pinpointed a specific internal \"obstacle factor\": extreme features leading to imprecise uncertainty. This highlighted a limitation of existing OOD scores that failed to account for the quality of the features themselves. [liu2023zb3] took this introspection further, arguing that prior neuron-centric studies were either too simplistic or detrimental to InD accuracy. It sought a fundamental understanding of OOD issues from neuron behavior, aiming for a unified solution for *both* OOD detection and generalization. [lafon2023w37] tackled the problem of existing post-hoc detectors exhibiting biases, performing well on either \"near-OOD\" or \"far-OOD\" but not both, and the computational overhead of ensembling. It aimed to create more robust and comprehensive detectors by combining and refining existing signals.\n\n*   *Key innovations*: [gomes2022zyv]'s use of Fisher-Rao distance provided a theoretically richer way to compare distributions. [zhu2022oir]'s TrBN unit was a simple yet effective plug-and-play module for feature rectification, boosting various existing OOD scores. [liu2023zb3]'s \"Neuron Activation State\" and \"Neuron Activation Coverage (NAC)\" offered a novel, interpretable, and statistically grounded framework for understanding and addressing OOD from a neuron-level perspective, leading to state-of-the-art results in both detection and generalization. [lafon2023w37]'s hybrid EBM framework, with its residual learning and principled composition function, provided a powerful mechanism to overcome the near/far-OOD trade-off and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.\n\n### Trend 2: Towards Principled and Theoretically-Backed Methodologies\n\n*   *Methodological progression*: This trend emphasizes moving beyond empirical heuristics to methods grounded in stronger theoretical foundations, offering guarantees or principled ways of combining information. [gomes2022zyv] laid groundwork by introducing Information Geometry, a field with deep mathematical roots, to OOD detection. This was a significant departure from ad-hoc scoring functions. [kaur2022cty] \"iDECODe: In-distribution Equivariance for Conformal Out-of-distribution Detection\" (2022) made a direct and impactful leap by integrating the Inductive Conformal Anomaly Detection (ICAD) framework. This allowed them to provide *rigorous theoretical guarantees* on the false detection rate, a critical requirement for safety-critical applications. [zhu2022oir] provided a theoretical analysis of the bias-variance trade-off introduced by its feature rectification, grounding its empirical success in a principled understanding. [liu2023zb3] introduced \"Neuron Activation Coverage\" as a *statistical measure* derived from probability density functions, establishing a positive correlation between NAC and model generalization ability, thus providing a principled criterion for robustness. Finally, [lafon2023w37] leveraged the robust theoretical framework of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) for both residual correction and principled composition of multiple OOD signals, offering a sound basis for combining different OOD detection mechanisms.\n\n*   *Problem evolution*: The core problem addressed here was the lack of reliability and interpretability in OOD detection. [gomes2022zyv] sought a unified, mathematically sound metric. [kaur2022cty] directly addressed the absence of *guaranteed* false detection rates, a major hurdle for deploying OOD systems in high-stakes environments. [zhu2022oir] aimed to improve the precision of uncertainty estimation by understanding the statistical properties of features. [liu2023zb3] sought a principled criterion for evaluating model robustness and generalization, moving beyond empirical observations. [lafon2023w37] aimed to combine the strengths of diverse OOD detectors in a principled, theoretically sound manner to overcome their individual biases.\n\n*   *Key innovations*: [gomes2022zyv]'s use of Fisher-Rao distance provided a mathematically elegant way to quantify distribution differences. [kaur2022cty]'s integration of ICAD and its novel NCM provided the first theoretical guarantees on bounded false detection rates for single-point OOD detection, a landmark achievement. [zhu2022oir]'s theoretical analysis of bias-variance trade-off for feature rectification provided a deeper understanding of its impact. [liu2023zb3]'s NAC, as a statistical measure, offered a principled way to quantify neuron behavior and correlate it with generalization. [lafon2023w37]'s EBM framework provided a theoretically sound and flexible approach for combining and refining multiple OOD signals, leading to superior performance across various OOD types.\n\n---\n\n*Synthesis:*\n\nThese works collectively demonstrate a powerful intellectual trajectory in OOD detection, moving from heuristic scoring towards a deeper, more principled understanding and manipulation of internal model mechanisms. Their collective contribution is the advancement of OOD detection from an empirical art to a more robust, theoretically grounded science, capable of providing reliable uncertainty estimates and even guarantees for critical applications."

[miao20246mk] *OpenCIL: Benchmarking Out-of-Distribution Detection in Class-Incremental Learning (2024)* introduces OOD detection in class-incremental learning (CIL), highlighting catastrophic forgetting as a new challenge.\n    *   **Unified Frameworks and Interdisciplinary Approaches:** [schmidt2024syr] *A Unified Approach Towards Active Learning and Out-of-Distribution Detection (2024)* represents a major conceptual shift by integrating OOD detection with Active Learning (AL). This moves beyond viewing OOD as a standalone problem to a component of a broader data acquisition and model improvement strategy.\n    *   **Advanced Outlier Synthesis (without real OOD data):** [li2025xv2] *Outlier Synthesis via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for Out-of-Distribution Detection (2025)* addresses a fundamental limitation of many training-driven OOD methods (like Outlier Exposure) by proposing a novel, efficient method for synthesizing diverse and representative virtual outliers using *only* in-distribution data. This is a new direction for overcoming data scarcity.\n    *   **Gradient-based Regularization for Robustness:** [sharifi2024gok] *Gradient-Regularized Out-of-Distribution Detection (2024)* introduces gradient regularization to promote local smoothness of the OOD score function, enhancing robustness. This builds on the idea of using gradients (seen in [chen2023za1] GAIA) but applies it as a *regularization strategy* during training.\n    *   **Meta-Analysis and Benchmarking:** [lu2024j0n] *Out-of-Distribution Detection: A Task-Oriented Survey of Recent Advances (2024)* is a meta-contribution, providing a novel \"task-oriented\" taxonomy. This validates the emergence of specialized OOD challenges and helps organize the field, aligning with the new papers focusing on specific learning paradigms.\n\n3.  **Gaps Filled and New Directions Opened:**\n    *   The new papers fill the gap of addressing OOD detection in complex, real-world learning scenarios (long-tail, incremental learning) which were not explicitly covered in the previous synthesis.\n    *   They open entirely new directions in integrating OOD with other ML tasks (Active Learning) and in sophisticated data synthesis techniques (HMC for outliers).\n    *   The explicit focus on *training-time feature separation* based on intrinsic properties ([wu20242p3]) is a deeper dive into model internals than previously seen.\n\n4.  **Connections between New and Earlier Works:**\n    *   [wu20242p3] directly connects to [ammar2023pr1] by evolving the use of Neural Collapse.\n    *   [shin2024lnf] and [miao2024318] relate to [yu2022egq]'s use of feature norms and energy-based methods, but apply them to the long-tail context and introduce active manipulation/adaptation.\n    *   [fang2024lv2] refines feature-based methods, conceptually linking to [anthony2023slf]'s Mahalanobis distance but with a focus on non-linear transformations.\n    *   [schmidt2024syr] leverages gradient-enhanced features, reminiscent of [chen2023za1] and [liu2023zb3], but for a unified AL+OOD task.\n    *   [sharifi2024gok]'s gradient regularization builds on the idea of using gradients as a signal, but for robustness during training.\n    *   [li2025xv2] addresses the data dependency of methods like Outlier Exposure, which is a common technique underlying many OOD approaches.\n\n5.  **Overall Narrative Change:** The addition of these papers significantly broadens the narrative. While the initial synthesis highlighted a shift from heuristics to principled properties and an expansion of OOD signals, the new papers introduce a strong emphasis on:\n    *   **Contextualized OOD:** Addressing OOD in specific, challenging learning paradigms.\n    *   **Integrated OOD:** Combining OOD with other machine learning tasks.\n    *   **Proactive OOD:** Developing advanced training strategies (feature separation, gradient regularization, outlier synthesis) to build OOD-aware models from the ground up, rather than solely relying on post-hoc analysis.\n    *   The field is maturing from fundamental signal discovery to robust, efficient, and context-aware deployment.\n\n**Temporal Positioning:**\nAll new papers are from 2024 (except [li2025xv2] from 2025, indicating forward-looking research), making them the latest developments in the field. They build upon the 2022-2023 papers, showcasing the rapid evolution and diversification of OOD detection research.\n\n---\n\n2. *Updated Evolution Analysis:*\n\nThe progression of research in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, now encompassing 14 papers from 2022-2025, reveals a deepening exploration of model internals, a significant expansion into challenging learning paradigms, and a push towards integrated, proactive, and data-efficient solutions.\n\n**Trend 1: From Heuristic Feature/Activation Manipulation to Principled Intrinsic Properties (Deepening)**\n\n*   *Methodological progression*: This trend, initially marked by [song2022f5d] *RankFeat: Rank-1 Feature Removal for Out-of-distribution Detection (2022)* using spectral analysis and [yu2022egq] *Block Selection Method for Using Feature Norm in Out-of-Distribution Detection (2022)* for optimal block selection, has profoundly deepened. [ammar2023pr1] *NECO: NEural Collapse Based Out-of-distribution detection (2023)* introduced leveraging Neural Collapse (NC) for post-hoc scoring. This is significantly advanced by [wu20242p3] *Pursuing Feature Separation based on Neural Collapse for Out-of-Distribution Detection (2024)*, which moves beyond post-hoc analysis to *actively train* models for feature separation. It constrains OOD features to be orthogonal to the ID feature subspace, directly exploiting NC properties during training. Similarly, [xu2023767] *VRA: Variational Rectified Activation for Out-of-distribution Detection (2023)* provided a theoretical derivation for optimal activation functions. Further refining feature space analysis, [fang2024lv2] *Kernel PCA for Out-of-Distribution Detection (2024)* introduces principled non-linear feature mappings (CoP, CoRP) for Kernel PCA, addressing the linear inseparability of features and enhancing a classic technique with modern insights.\n*   *Problem evolution*: While earlier works tackled over-confidence ([song2022f5d]) and optimal feature extraction ([yu2022egq]), [ammar2023pr1] sought to leverage fundamental geometric properties. [wu20242p3] addresses the limitation of existing training methods (like Outlier Exposure) that primarily focus on output discrepancy, arguing for and solving the problem of explicit *feature space separation* for OOD data. [fang2024lv2] tackles the computational inefficiency and linear separability issues of traditional PCA for OOD detection, providing a robust and efficient non-linear alternative.\n*   *Key innovations*: [wu20242p3] innovates with `Separation Loss` (`LSep`) and `Clustering Loss` (`LClu`) to enforce feature orthogonality and compactness based on Neural Collapse. [fang2024lv2] introduces novel explicit feature mappings (CoP, CoRP) for efficient Kernel PCA, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced inference complexity.\n*   *Integration points*: [wu20242p3] directly builds on the theoretical foundation of Neural Collapse established by [ammar2023pr1], evolving it into a training-time mechanism. [fang2024lv2] refines feature-based OOD detection, conceptually linking to earlier feature analysis methods while introducing advanced mathematical tools.\n\n**Trend 2: Expanding the Spectrum of OOD Signals: From Global Features to Neuron States and Explanations (Refined and Contextualized)**\n\n*   *Methodological progression*: This trend began with [anthony2023slf] *On the use of Mahalanobis distance for out-of-distribution detection with neural networks for medical imaging (2023)*, which introduced fine-grained layer-wise analysis. [liu2023zb3] *Neuron Activation Coverage: Rethinking Out-of-distribution Detection and Generalization (2023)* shifted to individual neuron states, and [chen2023za1] *GAIA: Delving into Gradient-based Attribution Abnormality for Out-of-distribution Detection (2023)* pioneered gradient-based attribution abnormality as a signal. [schmidt2024syr] *A Unified Approach Towards Active Learning and Out-of-Distribution Detection (2024)* refines the use of feature space distances and introduces *gradient-enhanced feature representations* by weighting neurons based on their gradient contribution, demonstrating a sophisticated way to leverage existing signal types for a broader purpose.\n*   *Problem evolution*: While earlier papers sought deeper insights into OOD root causes ([liu2023zb3]) or novel signals from interpretability ([chen2023za1]), [schmidt2024syr] addresses the problem of integrating OOD detection with Active Learning, recognizing their shared underlying metrics and the need for a unified solution in open-world scenarios.\n*   *Key innovations*: [schmidt2024syr] introduces SISOM, the first unified framework for Active Learning and OOD detection, featuring gradient-enhanced features, a novel distance ratio metric, and a self-deciding feature space analysis.\n*   *Integration points*: [schmidt2024syr]'s use of gradient-enhanced features conceptually links to [chen2023za1]'s and [liu2023zb3]'s exploration of gradients and neuron states as OOD signals, but applies them within an integrated framework for data acquisition.\n\n**New Trend 3: OOD in Challenging Learning Paradigms (Contextualized and Specialized)**\n\n*   *Methodological progression*: This trend marks a significant shift towards addressing OOD detection in specific, complex real-world scenarios. [shin2024lnf] *Representation Norm Amplification for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Long-Tail Learning (2024)* introduces RNA, a training method that decouples ID classification and OOD detection by actively amplifying ID representation norms. [miao2024318] *Long-Tailed Out-of-Distribution Detection via Normalized Outlier Distribution Adaptation (2024)* proposes AdaptOD, combining Dynamic Outlier Distribution Adaptation (DODA) at inference with a Dual-Normalized Energy Loss (DNE) during training to handle distribution shifts and class imbalance in long-tail settings. [miao20246mk] *OpenCIL: Benchmarking Out-of-Distribution Detection in Class-Incremental Learning (2024)* establishes a benchmark and proposes Bi-directional Energy Regularization (BER) to mitigate biases in CIL models.\n*   *Problem evolution*: These papers address the critical problem of OOD detection in long-tailed datasets, where tail-class ID samples are easily confused with OODs ([shin2024lnf], [miao2024318]), and in class-incremental learning, where catastrophic forgetting hinders OOD performance ([miao20246mk]). They highlight the inadequacy of general OOD methods in these specialized contexts.\n*   *Key innovations*: RNA ([shin2024lnf]) provides a novel training method for norm amplification. AdaptOD ([miao2024318]) introduces dynamic outlier distribution adaptation and a novel DNE loss. OpenCIL ([miao20246mk]) provides the first comprehensive benchmark for CIL-OOD and proposes BER to address specific CIL biases.\n*   *Integration points*: These papers collectively expand the scope of OOD research by demonstrating that the problem is not monolithic but requires tailored solutions for different learning paradigms.\n\n**New Trend 4: Proactive OOD-Aware Training and Data Efficiency**\n\n*   *Methodological progression*: This trend focuses on enhancing models' inherent OOD robustness during training. [sharifi2024gok] *Gradient-Regularized Out-of-Distribution Detection (2024)* introduces Gradient Regularization (GReg) to promote local smoothness of the OOD score function, ensuring robustness to perturbations. It also proposes an energy-based sampling method for auxiliary OOD data. Crucially, [li2025xv2] *Outlier Synthesis via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for Out-of-Distribution Detection (2025)* addresses the fundamental reliance on auxiliary OOD data by proposing HamOS, a novel framework for synthesizing diverse virtual outliers using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and only in-distribution data.\n*   *Problem evolution*: [sharifi2024gok] addresses the failure of auxiliary-data methods to fully exploit local information and the need for smoother OOD score manifolds. [li2025xv2] tackles the critical problem of acquiring high-quality natural OOD data, a bottleneck for many effective training-driven OOD methods.\n*   *Key innovations*: [sharifi2024gok] introduces `L∇S` for gradient regularization and a two-stage energy-based OOD sampling. [li2025xv2] pioneers the use of Markov chains (HMC) for efficient, diverse, and representative virtual outlier synthesis without real OOD data, along with a novel OOD-ness estimation and hard margin barrier.\n*   *Integration points*: These papers represent a proactive approach to OOD, moving beyond post-hoc analysis or simple auxiliary data use to fundamentally improve model training for OOD robustness and address data scarcity.\n\nFinally, [lu2024j0n] *Out-of-Distribution Detection: A Task-Oriented Survey of Recent Advances (2024)* serves as a meta-contribution, providing a novel task-oriented taxonomy that validates and organizes these emerging trends, particularly the focus on specific learning paradigms and the distinction between training-driven and training-agnostic methods.\n\n3. *Refined Synthesis*\nThe unified intellectual trajectory connecting all 14 works is a continuous and deepening quest for robust, efficient, and context-aware Out-of-Distribution detection. My understanding has been updated to recognize a significant maturation of the field, moving from foundational signal discovery and principled internal exploitation to addressing OOD within complex learning paradigms, integrating it with other ML tasks, and developing advanced, data-efficient training strategies. Collectively, this expanded view highlights a field rapidly evolving towards building inherently OOD-aware deep learning systems capable of reliable and safe deployment in diverse, open-world applications.",

        "abstract": "The task of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying machine learning models in real-world settings. In this paper, we observe that the singular value distributions of the in-distribution (ID) and OOD features are quite different: the OOD feature matrix tends to have a larger dominant singular value than the ID feature, and the class predictions of OOD samples are largely determined by it. This observation motivates us to propose \\texttt{RankFeat}, a simple yet effective \\texttt{post hoc} approach for OOD detection by removing the rank-1 matrix composed of the largest singular value and the associated singular vectors from the high-level feature (\\emph{i.e.,} $\\mathbf{X}{-} \\mathbf{s}_{1}\\mathbf{u}_{1}\\mathbf{v}_{1}^{T}$). \\texttt{RankFeat} achieves the \\emph{state-of-the-art} performance and reduces the average false positive rate (FPR95) by 17.90\\% compared with the previous best method.

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \"RankFeat: Rank-1 Feature Removal for Out-of-distribution Detection\" by Song, Sebe, and Wang \\cite{song2022f5d} for a literature review:\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of \"RankFeat: Rank-1 Feature Removal for Out-of-distribution Detection\" \\cite{song2022f5d}\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the critical challenge of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, where machine learning models often make over-confident predictions for samples that do not belong to the training data distribution.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge**: Safe and reliable deployment of deep learning models in real-world applications necessitates understanding when a test sample is OOD. The main challenge is that current deep learning models are prone to giving high-confidence, yet incorrect, predictions for OOD data.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Previous OOD detection methods typically rely on feature distance, activation abnormality, or gradient norms.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: While not explicitly detailed as limitations of *all* previous solutions, the paper positions its work as tackling the problem from a novel perspective (spectral analysis) compared to these existing categories. It also highlights that methods like ReAct \\cite{song2022f5d} use manually defined thresholds and require statistics of the whole ID set, which can be sub-optimal and less direct.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: \\cite{song2022f5d} proposes **RankFeat**, a simple yet effective post-hoc approach. It observes that OOD features tend to have a significantly larger dominant singular value compared to in-distribution (ID) features.\n        *   **Mechanism**: For a given high-level feature map `X`, RankFeat performs Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to obtain `X = USV^T`. It then removes the rank-1 matrix formed by the largest singular value `s1` and its corresponding singular vectors `u1` and `v1` (i.e., `X' = X - s1u1v1^T`).\n        *   **Scoring**: The perturbed feature `X'` is fed into the rest of the network to generate new logits `y'`, from which an OOD score (specifically, the Energy score `log(sum(exp(y')))` is computed.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   **Spectral Analysis**: The core innovation is the use of spectral analysis (SVD) of high-level features to identify and remove the dominant rank-1 component, which is observed to disproportionately influence OOD predictions.\n        *   **Direct Subtraction**: Unlike methods that clip activations, RankFeat directly subtracts the identified problematic rank-1 component.\n        *   **Acceleration**: It incorporates Power Iteration (PI) for efficient approximation of the dominant singular value and vectors, avoiding the computational cost of full SVD.\n        *   **Multi-scale Fusion**: Allows for combining scores from features at different network depths (e.g., Block 3 and Block 4) to leverage diverse semantic information.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithm/Method**: Introduction of **RankFeat**, a post-hoc OOD detection method based on removing the rank-1 matrix from high-level features, motivated by observed differences in singular value distributions between ID and OOD data.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights**:\n        *   Demonstrates that removing a rank-1 feature with a larger `s1` reduces the upper bound of the RankFeat score more, explaining why it disproportionately affects OOD samples.\n        *   Shows, using Random Matrix Theory (RMT), that removing the rank-1 matrix makes the statistics of OOD features closer to random matrices, suggesting OOD features become less informative.\n        *   Provides a theoretical connection to ReAct \\cite{song2022f5d}, showing both methods optimize an upper bound determined by `s1`, but RankFeat does so directly by subtraction, while ReAct uses indirect clipping.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: Integration of Power Iteration for acceleration and multi-scale feature fusion strategies.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Extensive evaluations were performed on large-scale ImageNet-1k \\cite{song2022f5d} as the ID dataset, with four challenging OOD datasets: iNaturalist, SUN, Places, and Textures \\cite{song2022f5d}. Additional validation was done on Species and CIFAR benchmarks. Ablation studies explored the impact of rank-1 vs. rank-n removal, application at various network depths, Power Iteration iterations, and fusion strategies.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**: False Positive Rate at 95% True Positive Rate (FPR95) and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC).\n    *   **Comparison Results**:\n        *   RankFeat achieved state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks and models.\n        *   It reduced the average FPR95 by **17.90%** and improved the average AUROC by **5.44%** compared to the previous best method (ReAct \\cite{song2022f5d}) on the ImageNet-1k benchmark with ResNetv2-101.\n        *   The method was validated across different architectures, including ResNetv2-101, SqueezeNet, and T2T-ViT-24.\n        *   Power Iteration achieved competitive performance with full SVD but with significantly less time overhead.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**:\n        *   RankFeat is a **post-hoc** approach, meaning it does not modify the model training process.\n        *   It relies on the empirical observation that OOD features have a larger dominant singular value, and that removing this component effectively mitigates over-confidence.\n        *   The theoretical bounds provided are for \"improving understanding\" rather than \"strict guarantee\" of the score.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: Applicable to various deep learning architectures (ResNets, Vision Transformers) and effective on large-scale, realistic datasets.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: RankFeat significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in post-hoc OOD detection, particularly on challenging large-scale benchmarks, by achieving substantial improvements in FPR95 and AUROC.\n    *   **Potential Impact**:\n        *   Introduces a novel perspective for OOD detection based on spectral properties of features, opening new avenues for research in understanding model behavior for OOD inputs.\n        *   Provides a simple, effective, and theoretically grounded method that can be easily integrated into existing deployed models without retraining.\n        *   The insights into the role of dominant singular values in OOD over-confidence could inspire further research into feature representation learning for OOD robustness.",

        "abstract": "Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs during the inference stage is crucial for deploying neural networks in the real world. Previous methods typically relied on the highly activated feature map outputted by the network. In this study, we revealed that the norm of the feature map obtained from a block other than the last block can serve as a better indicator for OOD detection. To leverage this insight, we propose a simple framework that comprises two metrics: FeatureNorm, which computes the norm of the feature map, and NormRatio, which calculates the ratio of FeatureNorm for ID and OOD samples to evaluate the OOD detection performance of each block. To identify the block that provides the largest difference between FeatureNorm of ID and FeatureNorm of OOD, we create jigsaw puzzles as pseudo OOD from ID training samples and compute NormRatio, selecting the block with the highest value. After identifying the suitable block, OOD detection using FeatureNorm outperforms other methods by reducing FPR95 by up to 52.77% on CIFAR10 benchmark and up to 48.53% on ImageNet benchmark. We demonstrate that our framework can generalize to various architectures and highlight the significance of block selection, which can also improve previous OOD detection methods.

        "abstract": "Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is a critical challenge in machine learning due to model overconfidence, often without awareness of their epistemological limits. We hypothesize that ``neural collapse'', a phenomenon affecting in-distribution data for models trained beyond loss convergence, also influences OOD data. To benefit from this interplay, we introduce NECO, a novel post-hoc method for OOD detection, which leverages the geometric properties of ``neural collapse'' and of principal component spaces to identify OOD data. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that NECO achieves state-of-the-art results on both small and large-scale OOD detection tasks while exhibiting strong generalization capabilities across different network architectures. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical explanation for the effectiveness of our method in OOD detection. Code is available at https://gitlab.com/drti/neco",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review, adhering to your requirements:\n\n### NECO: NEURAL COLLAPSE BASED OUT-OF-DISTRIBUTION DETECTION \\cite{ammar2023pr1}\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Problem**: Deep learning models exhibit unwarranted overconfidence when confronted with Out-of-Distribution (OOD) inputs, failing to recognize data outside their training distribution.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge**: This vulnerability poses significant safety implications in critical applications like medical imaging, industrial inspection, and autonomous driving, where models must not only classify known In-Distribution (ID) samples but also reliably flag OOD inputs as \"unknown.\" The challenge lies in developing effective, post-hoc OOD detection methods that do not alter the network training or harm performance.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing OOD Approaches**: The paper categorizes existing OOD detection methods into confidence-based (e.g., Softmax, Energy, ODIN), features/logits-based, and distance/density-based (e.g., Mahalanobis, nearest-neighbor). It specifically focuses on *post-hoc (unsupervised)* methods, which are desirable for seamless integration into production models without increased training cost.\n    *   **Neural Collapse (NC)**: Previous studies have identified \"Neural Collapse\" (NC) as a phenomenon in DNNs trained beyond loss convergence, characterized by within-class variability collapse (NC1), convergence of class means to a Simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) (NC2), self-duality (NC3), and simplification to nearest class-center classification (NC4).\n    *   **Limitations of Previous NC-OOD Work**: While Haas et al. (2023) demonstrated that collapsed models exhibit improved OOD detection, no prior work has directly leveraged the emergent geometric properties of NC for OOD detection.\n    *   **Positioning NECO**: NECO falls within the feature/logit-based post-hoc OOD methods. It relates to methods like NuSA and ViM, which also leverage principal/null spaces for OOD detection, but introduces a novel approach based on a newly observed NC property.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: NECO (NEural Collapse-based Out-of-distribution detection) is a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that leverages the geometric properties of Neural Collapse, particularly a newly identified property, and principal component spaces.\n    *   **Novel Observation (NC5)**: The paper introduces and empirically validates a novel property of Neural Collapse: **ID/OOD Orthogonality (NC5)**. This property states that as training progresses, OOD and ID data tend to become increasingly orthogonal to each other, meaning OOD data clusters become more perpendicular to the Simplex ETF configuration adopted by ID data. Mathematically, `∀c,⟨µc, µOOD_G⟩ / (∥µc∥2∥µOOD_G∥2) → 0`.\n    *   **NECO Score Calculation**: Building on NC5, NECO computes an OOD score for a sample `x` by calculating the relative norm of its feature vector `hω(x)` within the subspace occupied by the Simplex ETF structure. This is achieved by projecting `hω(x)` onto the principal component space derived from the ID training data's feature covariance matrix.\n        *   `NECO(x) = ∥P hω(x)∥ / ∥hω(x)∥ = sqrt(hω(x)⊤ PP⊤ hω(x)) / sqrt(hω(x)⊤ hω(x))`\n        *   Here, `P` is the projection matrix onto the `d` principal components extracted from the ID data's feature space `H`.\n    *   **Innovation over Related Work**: Unlike NuSA and ViM, which identify and utilize the *null space* (the component of the feature vector that does not directly impact classification) for OOD detection, NECO directly leverages the *principal component space* of the ID data. The hypothesis is that if NC1, NC2, and NC5 hold, OOD data, being orthogonal to ID data, will have a near-null projection onto the ID-derived principal space, while ID data will have a significant projection.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Theoretical Insight**: Introduction and empirical validation of the **ID/OOD Orthogonality (NC5)** property of Neural Collapse, demonstrating that OOD data becomes increasingly orthogonal to ID data's class means during the Terminal Phase of Training.\n    *   **Novel Algorithm/Method**: Proposal of **NECO**, a straightforward yet highly efficient post-hoc OOD detection method that directly leverages the geometric implications of Neural Collapse and the principal component space of ID data.\n    *   **Theoretical Analysis**: The paper provides a theoretical explanation for the effectiveness of NECO in OOD detection, linking its mechanism to the established and newly proposed NC properties.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Validation of NC5**: Experiments were conducted to validate the ID/OOD orthogonality (NC5) using CIFAR-10 as the ID dataset and CIFAR-100/SVHN as OOD datasets, employing ResNet-18 and ViT architectures. Results (Figure 1) show the `OrthoDev classes −OOD` metric consistently decreasing towards zero, confirming the convergence to ID/OOD orthogonality during training.\n    *   **NECO Performance**: The abstract states that NECO achieves **state-of-the-art results** on both small and large-scale OOD detection tasks.\n    *   **Generalization**: NECO exhibits **strong generalization capabilities** across different network architectures, including ResNet-18 on CIFAR10/CIFAR100 and Vision Transformer (ViT) networks on ImageNet-1K.\n    *   **Key Metrics**: While specific metrics are not detailed in the provided text, OOD detection performance is typically evaluated using metrics like AUROC, AUPR, and FPR@95%TPR.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Scope**: The method is specifically designed as a *post-hoc (unsupervised)* OOD detection approach, meaning it does not require modifications to the network training procedure or access to OOD samples during training.\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The effectiveness of NECO relies on the assumption that the underlying DNN exhibits Neural Collapse properties (NC1, NC2) and the newly proposed ID/OOD orthogonality (NC5). The paper does not explicitly state other technical limitations in the provided text.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: NECO advances the technical state-of-the-art in post-hoc OOD detection by introducing a novel, theoretically grounded approach that leverages the intrinsic geometric properties of deep neural networks during their terminal training phase.\n    *   **Impact on Future Research**: The discovery and empirical validation of ID/OOD orthogonality (NC5) provide a new fundamental insight into DNN behavior in the presence of OOD data, potentially opening new avenues for research in OOD detection, robustness, and understanding deep learning generalization. Its simplicity and efficiency make it a promising candidate for integration into safety-critical applications.",

Researchers have proposed various strategies to reduce model overconfidence on OOD data. Among them, ReAct is a typical and effective technique to deal with model overconfidence, which truncates high activations to increase the gap between in-distribution and OOD. Despite its promising results, is this technique the best choice for widening the gap? To answer this question, we leverage the variational method to find the optimal operation and verify the necessity of suppressing abnormally low and high activations and amplifying intermediate activations in OOD detection, rather than focusing only on high activations like ReAct. This motivates us to propose a novel technique called ``Variational Rectified Activation (VRA)'', which simulates these suppression and amplification operations using piecewise functions. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing post-hoc strategies.

The current VRA and VRA+ are approximations, and further research into better functional forms for `g*` is suggested.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** VRA is a post-hoc strategy, meaning it operates on pre-trained models without requiring additional training. It is compatible with various scoring functions and network architectures, making it broadly applicable to existing classification models for OOD detection.\n\n*   **7. Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** The paper significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in post-hoc OOD detection by providing a theoretical foundation for optimal activation rectification, moving beyond heuristic approaches like ReAct \\cite{xu2023767}. It demonstrates that a more comprehensive rectification (suppressing both low and high, amplifying intermediate) leads to superior performance.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:** The theoretical derivation of `g*` and the empirical success of VRA/VRA+ open new avenues for research into designing more effective and theoretically grounded activation functions for OOD detection. It encourages exploring more sophisticated functional approximations of `g*` and potentially integrating density estimation techniques to better estimate `pin` and `pout` for even higher performance. The compatibility with existing scoring functions also suggests its potential as a foundational component for future OOD detection systems.",

The community has developed several methods for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, within which distance-based approaches - such as Mahalanobis distance - have shown potential. This paper challenges the prevailing community understanding that there is an optimal layer, or combination of layers, of a neural network for applying Mahalanobis distance for detection of any OOD pattern. Using synthetic artefacts to emulate OOD patterns, this paper shows the optimum layer to apply Mahalanobis distance changes with the type of OOD pattern, showing there is no one-fits-all solution. This paper also shows that separating this OOD detector into multiple detectors at different depths of the network can enhance the robustness for detecting different OOD patterns. These insights were validated on real-world OOD tasks, training models on CheXpert chest X-rays with no support devices, then using scans with unseen pacemakers (we manually labelled 50% of CheXpert for this research) and unseen sex as OOD cases.

        "abstract": "The out-of-distribution (OOD) problem generally arises when neural networks encounter data that significantly deviates from the training data distribution, i.e., in-distribution (InD). In this paper, we study the OOD problem from a neuron activation view. We first formulate neuron activation states by considering both the neuron output and its influence on model decisions. Then, to characterize the relationship between neurons and OOD issues, we introduce the \\textit{neuron activation coverage} (NAC) -- a simple measure for neuron behaviors under InD data. Leveraging our NAC, we show that 1) InD and OOD inputs can be largely separated based on the neuron behavior, which significantly eases the OOD detection problem and beats the 21 previous methods over three benchmarks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K). 2) a positive correlation between NAC and model generalization ability consistently holds across architectures and datasets, which enables a NAC-based criterion for evaluating model robustness. Compared to prevalent InD validation criteria, we show that NAC not only can select more robust models, but also has a stronger correlation with OOD test performance.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** The paper addresses the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) problem, where neural networks encounter data significantly different from their training (in-distribution, InD) data, leading to performance degradation. It specifically tackles both OOD detection (identifying OOD inputs) and OOD generalization (building models robust to OOD data).\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** The OOD problem is prevalent in real-world applications, as the assumption of identical training and test data distributions rarely holds. Existing OOD solutions often lack fundamental insights into the root causes and mitigation strategies. Prior neuron-based approaches either modify network architectures (potentially harming InD accuracy) or oversimplify neuron states, discarding valuable distributional information \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** This work relates to two main categories of OOD research: OOD detection methods (e.g., OpenMax, ODIN, ViM) and OOD generalization techniques.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:** The paper argues that existing methods often fail to provide deep insights into the fundamental causes of OOD issues. Specifically, previous neuron-centric studies either involve network modifications that can compromise classification ability or rely on simplistic binary neuron activation states, which lose crucial information about neuron behavior distributions \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:**\n        *   **Neuron Activation State (ˆz):** The paper first formulates a novel neuron activation state `ˆz` by considering both the neuron's raw output (`z`) and its influence on model decisions. This influence is quantified using gradients derived from the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the network's output and a uniform vector. This formulation effectively combines the neuron's contribution to predictions (similar to `Input⊙Gradient`) with the model's confidence in the input data \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n        *   **Neuron Activation Coverage (NAC):** Inspired by coverage analysis in system testing, NAC is introduced as a simple statistical measure. It quantifies the \"coverage degree\" of neuron states under InD training data by deriving a function from the probability density function (PDF) of `ˆz`. A higher NAC score for a neuron state indicates it is frequently activated by InD data, suggesting fewer underlying defects in that state \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n        *   **NAC for Uncertainty Estimation (NAC-UE):** For OOD detection, NAC-UE directly averages the NAC scores across all neurons for a given test sample. OOD data is hypothesized to trigger abnormal neuron behaviors, resulting in lower average NAC scores, which serve as an uncertainty measure \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n        *   **NAC for Model Evaluation (NAC-ME):** For OOD generalization, NAC-ME measures model robustness by integrating the coverage distribution of all neurons. The hypothesis is that a larger coverage area (higher integral of NAC distribution) correlates with increased network robustness \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n    *   **Novelty:** The primary innovation lies in rethinking OOD problems from a neuron activation perspective, introducing a sophisticated yet interpretable formulation of neuron activation state, and proposing NAC as a novel, statistically grounded measure to characterize neuron behavior. This allows for a unified approach to both OOD detection and generalization, leveraging insights from software testing \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Formulation of Neuron Activation State:** A new method to define neuron activation (`ˆz`) that incorporates both raw output and its influence on model decisions via KL divergence gradients, capturing both neuron contribution and model confidence \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n    *   **Introduction of Neuron Activation Coverage (NAC):** A novel statistical measure that quantifies how well neuron states are \"covered\" by in-distribution training data, providing a direct indicator of potential defects or abnormal behavior \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n    *   **Algorithmic Frameworks for OOD Tasks:** Development of NAC-UE for state-of-the-art OOD detection and NAC-ME for robust OOD generalization evaluation, both built upon the NAC concept \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insight:** The establishment of a positive correlation between NAC and model generalization ability, providing a principled criterion for evaluating model robustness \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **OOD Detection (NAC-UE):**\n        *   **Experiments:** Evaluated on three benchmarks: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1k, using various OOD datasets (e.g., MNIST, SVHN, Textures, Places365, iNaturalist, OpenImage-O).\n        *   **Models:** ResNet-18 (for CIFAR), ResNet-50, and Vit-b16 (for ImageNet).\n        *   **Metrics:** FPR95 (False Positive Rate at 95% True Positive Rate) and AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve).\n        *   **Key Results:** NAC-UE achieved new state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming 21 previous best OOD detection methods. For instance, on CIFAR-100, it showed a 10.60% improvement on FPR95 and a 4.58% gain on AUROC over the competitive ViM. The NAC function was efficiently built using less than 5% of the InD training set \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n    *   **OOD Generalization (NAC-ME):**\n        *   **Experiments:** Conducted on DomainBed.\n        *   **Key Results:** Demonstrated a consistent positive correlation between NAC and model generalization ability across different architectures and datasets. NAC-ME was shown to select more robust models and exhibited an 11.61% stronger rank correlation with OOD test accuracy (on Vit-b16) compared to prevalent InD validation criteria \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations:** The effectiveness of NAC depends on the choice of the parameter `r` (lower bound for full coverage), which needs careful tuning to avoid dominance by noisy activations or vulnerability to data biases. The current implementation uses a histogram-based approximation for PDF, which might have implications for very fine-grained distributions \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The research primarily focuses on multi-class image classification tasks. While the underlying neuron-centric concepts are general, direct applicability and performance in other domains (e.g., natural language processing, time series) or different model architectures (e.g., generative models) would require further investigation.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art:** Significantly pushes the state-of-the-art in OOD detection, providing a highly effective and interpretable method.\n    *   **Novel Conceptual Framework:** Introduces a novel, neuron-centric framework for understanding and addressing OOD problems, offering a deeper insight into how models behave under distribution shifts \\cite{liu2023zb3}.\n    *   **Unified Solution:** Provides a unified approach (NAC) that is applicable to both OOD detection and OOD generalization, suggesting a common underlying mechanism for these challenges.\n    *   **Impact on Future Research:** Opens new avenues for research in model robustness, interpretability, and generalization by focusing on the statistical properties of neuron activation patterns, potentially leading to more principled and robust AI systems \\cite{liu2023zb3}.",

The challenge arises because methods designed for long-tailed recognition (LTR) and OOD detection often have conflicting goals in the logit space, leading to trade-offs between ID classification accuracy (especially for tail classes) and OOD detection performance \\cite{shin2024lnf}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** Previous work in OOD detection for long-tail learning (LT-OOD) includes training methodologies like PASCL \\cite{shin2024lnf} and BEL \\cite{shin2024lnf} (often using two-branch architectures), post-hoc scoring techniques \\cite{shin2024lnf}, and abstention class learning methods like EAT \\cite{shin2024lnf} and COCL \\cite{shin2024lnf}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n        *   Simply combining existing LTR methods (e.g., Logit Adjustment - LA) with OOD methods (e.g., Outlier Exposure - OE) results in performance trade-offs, where improving one metric (e.g., OOD detection) degrades the other (e.g., tail-class classification accuracy) \\cite{shin2024lnf}.\n        *   Methods like PASCL and BEL often rely on two-branch architectures, increasing model complexity.\n        *   While some methods utilize representation norms for OOD scoring (e.g., Objectosphere \\cite{shin2024lnf}, CSI \\cite{shin2024lnf}, NAN \\cite{shin2024lnf}), they generally lack a dedicated training method to *actively widen the gap* between ID and OOD representation norms.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper introduces Representation Norm Amplification (RNA) \\cite{shin2024lnf}, a novel training method that decouples ID classification and OOD detection. It uses the norm of the representation vector as a new dimension for OOD detection, while classification is handled in the logit space.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:**\n        *   RNA \\cite{shin2024lnf} intentionally induces a noticeable discrepancy in the representation norm between ID and OOD data.\n        *   It achieves this by training the classifier to minimize classification loss *only for ID samples*, regularized by a loss that *enlarges the norm of ID representations*.\n        *   Crucially, auxiliary OOD samples are passed through the network to regularize Batch Normalization (BN) layers using both ID and OOD data. This process indirectly reduces OOD representation norms and creates a discernible difference in activation ratios and representation norms.\n        *   The key innovation is that *only ID data is involved in the gradient for updating model parameters* for the classification objective, ensuring that feature learning for ID classification is not perturbed by OOD regularization.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Training Method:** RNA \\cite{shin2024lnf} provides a unique training methodology that disentangles ID classification and OOD detection in long-tail learning by leveraging representation norms.\n    *   **Decoupling Strategy:** It proposes a novel strategy to decouple these two problems, performing classification in the logit space and OOD detection in the embedding space using representation norms.\n    *   **Mechanism for Norm Discrepancy:** The method introduces a specific mechanism involving ID norm amplification and BN layer regularization with OOD data to create a clear separation in representation norms.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** RNA \\cite{shin2024lnf} was evaluated on standard OOD detection benchmarks in long-tail settings.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison:**\n        *   **Metrics:** FPR95 (False Positive Rate at 95% True Positive Rate for OOD detection) and classification accuracy.\n        *   **Datasets:** CIFAR10-LT and ImageNet-LT.\n        *   **Results:** RNA \\cite{shin2024lnf} achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods:\n            *   Improved FPR95 by 1.70% (CIFAR10-LT) and 9.46% (ImageNet-LT).\n            *   Improved classification accuracy by 2.43% (CIFAR10-LT) and 6.87% (ImageNet-LT).\n            *   Demonstrated simultaneous high performance in both OOD detection and classification, effectively overcoming the trade-offs observed in previous methods (e.g., CE+OE, LA+OE, PASCL).\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The method relies on the availability of an auxiliary OOD dataset for training, similar to Outlier Exposure. The effectiveness of the BN regularization mechanism is central to its performance.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** RNA \\cite{shin2024lnf} is specifically designed for OOD detection in the context of *long-tail learning*, where class imbalance is a significant factor.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** RNA \\cite{shin2024lnf} significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing a method that simultaneously achieves high performance in both OOD detection and long-tail classification, resolving a long-standing trade-off.\n    *   **Potential Impact:** It introduces a new paradigm for tackling combined OOD and long-tail problems by decoupling them and leveraging representation norms. This could inspire future research into alternative dimensions or spaces for OOD detection that do not interfere with the primary classification task, particularly in challenging imbalanced data scenarios.",

        "abstract": "One key challenge in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is the absence of ground-truth OOD samples during training. One principled approach to address this issue is to use samples from external datasets as outliers (i.e., pseudo OOD samples) to train OOD detectors. However, we find empirically that the outlier samples often present a distribution shift compared to the true OOD samples, especially in Long-Tailed Recognition (LTR) scenarios, where ID classes are heavily imbalanced, \\ie, the true OOD samples exhibit very different probability distribution to the head and tailed ID classes from the outliers. In this work, we propose a novel approach, namely normalized outlier distribution adaptation (AdaptOD), to tackle this distribution shift problem. One of its key components is dynamic outlier distribution adaptation that effectively adapts a vanilla outlier distribution based on the outlier samples to the true OOD distribution by utilizing the OOD knowledge in the predicted OOD samples during inference. Further, to obtain a more reliable set of predicted OOD samples on long-tailed ID data, a novel dual-normalized energy loss is introduced in AdaptOD, which leverages class- and sample-wise normalized energy to enforce a more balanced prediction energy on imbalanced ID samples. This helps avoid bias toward the head samples and learn a substantially better vanilla outlier distribution than existing energy losses during training. It also eliminates the need of manually tuning the sensitive margin hyperparameters in energy losses. Empirical results on three popular benchmarks for OOD detection in LTR show the superior performance of AdaptOD over state-of-the-art methods.

A key issue is the distribution shift between pseudo OOD samples (outliers from external datasets used for training) and true OOD samples encountered during inference.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**:\n        *   Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are often overconfident about unknown inputs, leading to misclassification of OOD samples.\n        *   In LTR, this problem is amplified: head (majority) ID samples can have high-confidence predictions similar to OOD samples, while tail (minority) ID samples receive low-confidence predictions, making them indistinguishable from OODs or prone to being wrongly detected as OOD.\n        *   The lack of ground-truth OOD samples during training necessitates using external \"outlier\" datasets, but their distribution often mismatches that of true OODs, especially with imbalanced ID data, misleading detector training.\n        *   Existing energy-based OOD detection methods can underestimate tail class distributions and require sensitive hyperparameter tuning for energy margins.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**:\n        *   Builds upon energy-based OOD detection methods \\cite{miao2024318} that use global energy scores.\n        *   Relates to Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) for OOD detection, but differentiates by focusing on outlier distribution calibration rather than model retraining or feature memory augmentation.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   Existing OOD detection methods in LTR assume outlier distributions align well with true OODs, which is often false in practice due to diverse unknown OOD distributions \\cite{miao2024318}.\n        *   TTA methods for OOD detection (e.g., AUTO \\cite{miao2024318}, AdaOOD \\cite{miao2024318}) often require online model retraining or feature memory augmentation, incurring significant overheads and struggling with the large variation in heavily imbalanced LTR data.\n        *   Prior energy loss functions for training OOD detectors underestimate tail class distributions and involve sensitive margin hyperparameters, leading to inaccurate vanilla outlier distributions and OOD filters \\cite{miao2024318}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: `\\cite{miao2024318}` proposes **AdaptOD**, a novel approach for OOD detection in LTR, comprising two key components:\n        *   **Dynamic Outlier Distribution Adaptation (DODA)**: During inference, DODA dynamically adapts a \"vanilla\" outlier distribution (initialized from pseudo OOD data) to the true OOD distribution. It uses an OOD filter (based on Z-score of global energy) to identify predicted OOD samples and then performs a momentum update of the outlier distribution based on these samples. The adapted distribution is then used to calibrate the global energy score for final OOD detection.\n        *   **Dual-Normalized Energy Loss (DNE)**: This novel loss function is introduced during training to learn a better vanilla outlier distribution. DNE consists of:\n            *   **Batch Energy Normalization**: Normalizes logit outputs for each class across a batch of training samples.\n            *   **Class-wise Normalized Energy Loss (DNE-C)**: Balances the sum of energy for all ID samples within each ID class.\n            *   **Sample-wise Normalized Energy Loss (DNE-S)**: Balances the sum of energy across all ID classes for each ID sample.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   First approach to adapt the outlier distribution to the true OOD distribution from both training and inference stages \\cite{miao2024318}.\n        *   DODA performs test-time adaptation by calibrating the outlier distribution without requiring model retraining or additional memory overheads, unlike prior TTA methods.\n        *   DNE addresses the LTR imbalance by enforcing balanced prediction energy on head and tail samples, transferring energy from head to tail, and eliminating the need for manual tuning of sensitive energy margin hyperparameters.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**:\n        *   **AdaptOD Framework**: A holistic approach combining training and inference-time adaptation for OOD detection in LTR.\n        *   **Dynamic Outlier Distribution Adaptation (DODA)**: An online, momentum-based adaptation mechanism for outlier distributions using predicted OOD samples during inference.\n        *   **Dual-Normalized Energy Loss (DNE)**: A novel loss function incorporating Batch Energy Normalization, Class-wise Normalized Energy Loss (DNE-C), and Sample-wise Normalized Energy Loss (DNE-S) to learn balanced energy predictions for long-tailed ID data.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: The integration of DODA and DNE allows for a more robust and adaptive OOD detection system that can handle distribution shifts and class imbalance effectively.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: DNE's design provides a mechanism to balance energy predictions across imbalanced classes, mitigating the bias towards head classes and improving the quality of the vanilla outlier distribution, which is crucial for effective adaptation.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Extensive empirical results were conducted on three popular LTR benchmarks: CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-LT.\n    *   **OOD Datasets**: Six popular OOD datasets were used to evaluate performance.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**: Standard OOD detection metrics (e.g., AUROC, AUPR-In, AUPR-Out, FPR@95TPR) are typically used, though not explicitly listed in the abstract/intro, they are standard for such evaluations.\n    *   **Comparison Results**: AdaptOD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) OOD detection methods across various LTR scenarios \\cite{miao2024318}. The paper highlights that DODA based on predicted OOD samples can well approximate the upper-bound performance obtained with an oracle model (Table 5 in the full paper). Visualizations (Fig. 1) demonstrate better alignment of adapted outlier distributions with true OOD distributions compared to baselines.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**:\n        *   The OOD filter relies on a Z-score-based threshold (hyperparameter α) determined from training ID data, assuming a certain separability of ID and OOD energy distributions.\n        *   The momentum update in DODA assumes that the predicted OOD samples provide reliable \"OOD knowledge\" for adaptation.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: Primarily focused on OOD detection in image classification tasks with long-tailed ID data. While the principles might extend, direct applicability to other data modalities or OOD definitions (e.g., semantic shift vs. novelty detection) is not explicitly discussed.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: `\\cite{miao2024318}` significantly advances OOD detection in LTR by explicitly addressing the critical problem of distribution shift between pseudo and true OOD samples. It provides a novel, efficient, and effective solution that avoids the retraining or memory overheads of previous TTA methods.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n        *   Opens new avenues for research into dynamic outlier distribution adaptation during inference, potentially inspiring similar calibration techniques for other OOD detection challenges.\n        *   The DNE loss function offers a principled way to handle class imbalance in energy-based OOD detection, which could be adopted or extended in other imbalanced learning scenarios.\n        *   The framework's success in LTR suggests its potential for real-world applications where data is inherently imbalanced and unknown inputs are common (e.g., medical diagnosis, autonomous systems).",

Existing works have shown the insufficiency of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) straightforwardly applied on the features of DNNs in detecting OoD data from In-Distribution (InD) data. The failure of PCA suggests that the network features residing in OoD and InD are not well separated by simply proceeding in a linear subspace, which instead can be resolved through proper non-linear mappings. In this work, we leverage the framework of Kernel PCA (KPCA) for OoD detection, and seek suitable non-linear kernels that advocate the separability between InD and OoD data in the subspace spanned by the principal components. Besides, explicit feature mappings induced from the devoted task-specific kernels are adopted so that the KPCA reconstruction error for new test samples can be efficiently obtained with large-scale data. Extensive theoretical and empirical results on multiple OoD data sets and network structures verify the superiority of our KPCA detector in efficiency and efficacy with state-of-the-art detection performance.",

This capability is crucial to the safety of deploying CIL models in open worlds. However, despite remarkable advancements in the respective CIL and OOD detection, there lacks a systematic and large-scale benchmark to assess the capability of advanced CIL models in detecting OOD samples. To fill this gap, in this study we design a comprehensive empirical study to establish such a benchmark, named $\\textbf{OpenCIL}$. To this end, we propose two principled frameworks for enabling four representative CIL models with 15 diverse OOD detection methods, resulting in 60 baseline models for OOD detection in CIL. The empirical evaluation is performed on two popular CIL datasets with six commonly-used OOD datasets. One key observation we find through our comprehensive evaluation is that the CIL models can be severely biased towards the OOD samples and newly added classes when they are exposed to open environments. Motivated by this, we further propose a new baseline for OOD detection in CIL, namely Bi-directional Energy Regularization ($\\textbf{BER}$), which is specially designed to mitigate these two biases in different CIL models by having energy regularization on both old and new classes.

        "abstract": "When applying deep learning models in open-world scenarios, active learning (AL) strategies are crucial for identifying label candidates from a nearly infinite amount of unlabeled data. In this context, robust out-of-distribution (OOD) detection mechanisms are essential for handling data outside the target distribution of the application. However, current works investigate both problems separately. In this work, we introduce SISOM as the first unified solution for both AL and OOD detection. By leveraging feature space distance metrics SISOM combines the strengths of the currently independent tasks to solve both effectively. We conduct extensive experiments showing the problems arising when migrating between both tasks. In these evaluations SISOM underlined its effectiveness by achieving first place in two of the widely used OpenOOD benchmarks and second place in the remaining one. In AL, SISOM outperforms others and delivers top-1 performance in three benchmarks",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \"A Unified Approach Towards Active Learning and Out-of-Distribution Detection\" by Schmidt et al. for a literature review:\n\n*   **CITATION**: \\cite{schmidt2024syr}\n\n---\n\n### Focused Summary for Literature Review\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** Deep learning models in open-world scenarios face two critical, yet separately addressed, challenges: (1) the need for vast amounts of labeled data (addressed by Active Learning - AL) and (2) unpredictable behavior when encountering data outside the training distribution (Out-of-Distribution - OOD detection) \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** Both AL and OOD detection are crucial for robust real-world applications (e.g., mobile robotic perception). While they share common underlying metrics (uncertainty, latent space distances), current research investigates them in isolation. A simple migration of methods between tasks is ineffective due to domain-specific challenges (e.g., OOD training schemes, AL batch diversification). The paper argues for a unified approach, as real-world applications frequently necessitate concurrent consideration of both problems \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:**\n        *   **Active Learning (AL):** Existing AL methods primarily focus on pool-based scenarios, selecting samples based on prediction uncertainty (e.g., Monte Carlo Dropout, ensembles), latent space diversity (e.g., CoreSet, coverage-based), or auxiliary models (e.g., loss estimation, autoencoders) \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n        *   **Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Detection:** OOD detection encompasses various techniques, including preprocessing (e.g., data augmentation) and postprocessing methods. Postprocessing includes logit-based approaches (e.g., energy scores, temperature scaling), and methods relying on feature space distances (e.g., Mahalanobis distance, k-NN) or gradients \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:** The primary limitation is the \"disentanglement\" of AL and OOD detection. No existing method has been designed or tested for both scenarios simultaneously, despite their conceptual connections and practical co-occurrence in real-world applications \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method (SISOM - Simultaneous Informative Sampling and Outlier Mining):** \\cite{schmidt2024syr}\n        *   **Unified Solution:** SISOM is introduced as the first unified solution for both AL and OOD detection, leveraging enriched feature space distance metrics.\n        *   **Coverage:** Employs neural coverage techniques by concatenating latent spaces from multiple layers to identify unexplored regions (for diversity in AL or OOD samples) and decision boundary regions (for refining AL and detecting near-OOD).\n        *   **Feature Enhancement:** Enriches feature representations by weighting neurons based on their gradient contribution to the KL divergence between a uniform distribution and the model's softmax output. This gradient acts as a saliency weighting, prioritizing influential neurons.\n        *   **Distance Ratio:** Computes a ratio of inner-class distance (minimal distance to a known sample of the same pseudo-class) to outer-class distance (minimal distance to a known sample of a different pseudo-class) in the gradient-enhanced feature space. This guides sample selection towards decision boundaries and unexplored regions. A representative subset of labeled samples is used for efficiency.\n        *   **Feature Space Analysis:** Introduces a self-deciding process that combines the distance ratio score with an uncertainty-based energy score. The weighting between these two scores is dynamically determined by `ravg`, the average distance ratio of known samples, which estimates the separability of the feature space. If `ravg` is high (poor separation), the energy score is prioritized; if low (good separation), the distance ratio is prioritized.\n        *   **Sigmoid Steepness (Optional):** Allows for further refinement of feature space representations by introducing a layer-wise steepness parameter `αj` for the sigmoid function used in Feature Enhancement, which can be optimized to minimize `ravg(α)`.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:** SISOM is novel as the first unified approach to AL and OOD detection. It innovatively combines neural coverage, gradient-based feature weighting, a refined distance ratio metric, and a self-adaptive mechanism (Feature Space Analysis) to robustly handle varying feature space separability \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods:**\n        *   **SISOM:** A novel unified framework for Simultaneous Informative Sampling and Outlier Mining, addressing both AL and OOD detection \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n        *   **Gradient-enhanced feature representation:** A technique that weights neuron activations based on their contribution to KL divergence, improving feature saliency for both tasks \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n        *   **Distance Ratio metric:** A refined metric leveraging inner-to-outer class distances in the enhanced feature space for precise sample selection and outlier identification \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n        *   **Feature Space Analysis:** A self-deciding process that dynamically combines distance-based and uncertainty-based scores, adapting to the separability of the feature space \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n        *   **Sigmoid Steepness optimization:** An optional method to fine-tune feature representations for improved separability \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations:** Proposes a compound framework that integrates the AL training phase and the OOD detection operation phase, illustrating their concurrent application in real-world scenarios \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis:** Explores the fundamental connection between AL and OOD detection, demonstrating that a simple migration of methods is insufficient and a unified approach is beneficial. It also highlights the dependence of feature space metrics on latent space separation \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** Extensive experiments were conducted to assess SISOM's performance on both AL and OOD detection tasks individually. The AL evaluation used the standard pool-based scenario, while OOD detection followed the OpenOOD benchmarking framework. The paper also investigated the problems arising from migrating methods between tasks \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results:**\n        *   **OOD Detection:** SISOM achieved first place in two of the widely used OpenOOD benchmarks and second place in the remaining one \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n        *   **Active Learning:** SISOM outperformed other methods, delivering top-1 performance in three benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in AL \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n        *   Comparisons were made against several AL baselines (e.g., CoreSet, Badge) and an adapted OOD method (NAC) for AL \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The performance of feature space metrics, including SISOM's distance ratio, is highly dependent on a \"well-defined latent space\" with good feature separation. The computational cost of distance calculations is mitigated by using a representative subset of labeled samples \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The approach is primarily designed for deep learning models in open-world scenarios, with evaluations conducted on image classification tasks using standard AL and OpenOOD benchmarks \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art:** SISOM represents a significant advancement by introducing the first unified solution for AL and OOD detection, addressing a critical gap in current research. Its state-of-the-art performance in both domains demonstrates the effectiveness of this integrated approach \\cite{schmidt2024syr}. The self-adaptive Feature Space Analysis mechanism enhances practical robustness \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:** This work opens new research avenues for developing combined AL and OOD detection strategies, moving beyond their traditional separate investigation. It encourages further exploration of dynamic feature space adaptation and the interplay between data selection and anomaly detection for more robust and efficient deep learning deployments in real-world settings \\cite{schmidt2024syr}.",

        "title": "Pursuing Feature Separation based on Neural Collapse for Out-of-Distribution Detection",
        "abstract": "In the open world, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data, whose labels are disjoint with those of in-distribution (ID) samples, is important for reliable deep neural networks (DNNs). To achieve better detection performance, one type of approach proposes to fine-tune the model with auxiliary OOD datasets to amplify the difference between ID and OOD data through a separation loss defined on model outputs. However, none of these studies consider enlarging the feature disparity, which should be more effective compared to outputs. The main difficulty lies in the diversity of OOD samples, which makes it hard to describe their feature distribution, let alone design losses to separate them from ID features. In this paper, we neatly fence off the problem based on an aggregation property of ID features named Neural Collapse (NC). NC means that the penultimate features of ID samples within a class are nearly identical to the last layer weight of the corresponding class. Based on this property, we propose a simple but effective loss called Separation Loss, which binds the features of OOD data in a subspace orthogonal to the principal subspace of ID features formed by NC. In this way, the features of ID and OOD samples are separated by different dimensions. By optimizing the feature separation loss rather than purely enlarging output differences, our detection achieves SOTA performance on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks without any additional data augmentation or sampling, demonstrating the importance of feature separation in OOD detection.

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **1. Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Problem**: Detecting Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data is crucial for reliable deep neural networks (DNNs) in open-world scenarios, especially in safety-critical applications.\n    *   **Challenge**: Models trained solely on in-distribution (ID) data often make over-confident predictions on OOD data, and OOD features tend to intermingle with ID features. Existing methods that use auxiliary OOD datasets primarily focus on amplifying differences in the *output space*, neglecting the *feature space*. Designing effective feature separation losses for diverse OOD samples is difficult due to their varied and dispersed feature distributions.\n\n*   **2. Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation**: This work builds upon methods that utilize auxiliary OOD datasets to fine-tune models, such as Outlier Exposure (OE) \\cite{wu20242p3} and Energy-based methods \\cite{wu20242p3}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Previous approaches (e.g., OE, Energy method) primarily focus on increasing the *output discrepancy* between ID and OOD samples. None of these studies explicitly consider enhancing separability in the *feature space*, which is argued to be more effective. Traditional feature separation losses (e.g., dispersion loss, KL divergence) are unsuitable for OOD data due to their inherent diversity and dispersed feature distributions.\n\n*   **3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: \\cite{wu20242p3} proposes a novel \"Separation Loss\" (`LSep`) to explicitly separate ID and OOD features in the feature space.\n    *   **Innovation**: The approach leverages the \"Neural Collapse (NC)\" property \\cite{wu20242p3} of ID features, which states that penultimate features of ID samples within a class are nearly identical to the last layer weight of the corresponding class.\n    *   **Mechanism**: Based on NC, \\cite{wu20242p3} constrains OOD features to lie in a subspace *orthogonal* to the principal subspace of ID features (which is spanned by the FC layer weights). This ensures ID and OOD features are separated by different dimensions.\n    *   **Loss Formulation**: The `LSep` calculates the average absolute value of the cosine similarity between normalized OOD features and the normalized weights of the final FC layer, aiming to minimize this to zero.\n    *   **Assistant Loss**: An additional \"Clustering Loss\" (`LClu`) is introduced for ID data, encouraging ID features within a class to align closely with their corresponding FC weight, thereby promoting the Neural Collapse phenomenon and making ID features more clustered.\n    *   **Overall Objective**: The final training objective combines standard cross-entropy for ID data, Outlier Exposure loss for auxiliary OOD data, and the proposed `LClu` and `LSep` losses.\n\n*   **4. Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Concept**: First to propose the concept of *feature separation* when fine-tuning models with auxiliary OOD data, shifting the focus from output separation.\n    *   **Novel Loss Function**: Introduction of the `Separation Loss` (`LSep`) that leverages the Neural Collapse property of ID features to constrain OOD features to an orthogonal subspace.\n    *   **Assistant Loss**: Development of the `Clustering Loss` (`LClu`) to enhance ID feature compactness and reinforce Neural Collapse.\n    *   **Methodological Framework**: Provides a simple yet effective framework that can be widely applied as a stronger baseline and seamlessly integrated with existing auxiliary OOD data approaches.\n\n*   **5. Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments**: Extensive experiments were conducted on representative OOD detection setups.\n    *   **Benchmarks**: Evaluated on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet datasets.\n    *   **Key Metrics**: Performance was measured using FPR95 (False Positive Rate at 95% True Positive Rate) and AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve).\n    *   **Results**: Achieves State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance without requiring additional data augmentation or sampling algorithms.\n        *   For example, on the CIFAR100 benchmark, \\cite{wu20242p3} achieved an average FPR95 of 29.58% and AUROC of 94.01%, outperforming the traditional Outlier Exposure (OE) method by 8.19% on FPR95.\n    *   **Visualizations**: Feature visualizations (e.g., Figure 2) empirically demonstrate that the proposed method significantly increases the separability between ID and OOD features compared to vanilla and OE-trained models.\n\n*   **6. Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Assumptions**: The method's effectiveness relies on the Neural Collapse property holding for the ID data and model architecture.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: Primarily applicable to scenarios where auxiliary OOD datasets are available for fine-tuning. It can serve as a stronger baseline for methods that currently use OE loss.\n\n*   **7. Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement**: Advances the technical state-of-the-art in OOD detection by achieving SOTA performance on standard benchmarks.\n    *   **New Insights**: Provides new insights into OOD detection by demonstrating the critical importance of feature separation over mere output separation.\n    *   **Future Research Impact**: The proposed feature separation loss can serve as a stronger and more effective baseline for future research in OOD detection, particularly for methods utilizing auxiliary OOD data.

        "abstract": "One of the challenges for neural networks in real-life applications is the overconfident errors these models make when the data is not from the original training distribution. Addressing this issue is known as Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. Many state-of-the-art OOD methods employ an auxiliary dataset as a surrogate for OOD data during training to achieve improved performance. However, these methods fail to fully exploit the local information embedded in the auxiliary dataset. In this work, we propose the idea of leveraging the information embedded in the gradient of the loss function during training to enable the network to not only learn a desired OOD score for each sample but also to exhibit similar behavior in a local neighborhood around each sample. We also develop a novel energy-based sampling method to allow the network to be exposed to more informative OOD samples during the training phase. This is especially important when the auxiliary dataset is large. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on several OOD benchmarks, improving the existing state-of-the-art FPR95 by 4% on our ImageNet experiment.

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **CITATION**: \\cite{sharifi2024gok}\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   Neural networks exhibit overconfident errors when encountering Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data, which is a significant barrier to their safe and robust deployment in real-world applications \\cite{sharifi2024gok}.\n    *   Existing state-of-the-art OOD detection methods, particularly those that utilize auxiliary OOD datasets during training, often fail to fully exploit the rich local information embedded within these datasets \\cite{sharifi2024gok}.\n    *   The problem is challenging because the OOD space is vast and diverse, making it difficult for models to generalize robustly without explicit mechanisms to understand local data behavior and efficiently utilize potentially large auxiliary datasets \\cite{sharifi2024gok}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   OOD detection methods are broadly categorized into post-hoc approaches (e.g., MSP, ODIN, Energy) that do not use auxiliary data, and methods that leverage auxiliary OOD data during training (e.g., OE, Energy, OpenMix) \\cite{sharifi2024gok}. The latter generally achieve superior performance.\n    *   Previous auxiliary-data-based methods primarily focus on optimizing the value of a scoring function (e.g., energy score) to separate ID and OOD samples, often overlooking the local behavior or smoothness of this score function around data points \\cite{sharifi2024gok}.\n    *   While some works address outlier sampling (e.g., NTOM, POEM, DOS) for large auxiliary datasets, greedy sampling can introduce bias. This work positions itself by addressing the lack of local information exploitation and proposing a more robust sampling strategy \\cite{sharifi2024gok}. The paper explicitly contrasts its goal of decreasing the norm of the score function with `[52]` which aims to increase the Jacobian norm difference.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Gradient Regularization (GReg):** The core innovation is to leverage the gradient of the OOD score function during training to learn local information and promote a smoother score manifold \\cite{sharifi2024gok}.\n        *   A novel regularization term, `L∇S`, is introduced into the loss function. This term penalizes the norm of the gradient of the score function (`∥∇S(x)∥`) specifically for correctly detected ID and OOD samples \\cite{sharifi2024gok}. This encourages local stability, ensuring that small perturbations around correctly classified samples do not drastically alter their OOD score.\n        *   The formulation `L∇SEn` (Equation 3) is tailored for the energy score, applying regularization only to samples whose energy scores are already at desired levels (low for ID, high for OOD) \\cite{sharifi2024gok}.\n    *   **Energy-Based OOD Sampling (part of GReg+):** A novel two-stage sampling method is developed to select more informative and diverse OOD samples from large auxiliary datasets \\cite{sharifi2024gok}.\n        *   It first employs **K-Means clustering** on normalized features of OOD samples to ensure that the model is exposed to diverse regions of the feature space, mitigating bias \\cite{sharifi2024gok}.\n        *   Within each cluster, **energy-based selection** is performed: samples with the smallest energy scores are chosen to be pushed towards higher OOD scores (for the main energy loss), while samples with the largest energy scores are chosen to enforce local smoothness where scores are already high (for the gradient regularization loss) \\cite{sharifi2024gok}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Gradient Regularization Method:** Introduction of `L∇S`, a gradient regularization term that explicitly penalizes the norm of the score function's gradient for correctly classified samples, thereby promoting local smoothness and robustness around ID and OOD data points \\cite{sharifi2024gok}.\n    *   **Novel Energy-Based Sampling Algorithm:** A sophisticated two-stage sampling strategy that combines K-Means clustering on normalized features for diversity, followed by energy-score-based selection within clusters to identify the most informative samples for both the primary OOD loss and the gradient regularization loss \\cite{sharifi2024gok}.\n    *   **Theoretical Analysis:** Provides a theoretical foundation for gradient regularization through the lens of certified robustness and Lipschitz analysis, demonstrating that promoting smoothness inherently improves OOD robustness by preventing abrupt changes in score values due to minor input perturbations \\cite{sharifi2024gok}.\n    *   **Integrated System (GReg+):** Proposes GReg+, which systematically integrates the novel gradient regularization with the energy-based sampling method, enhancing existing state-of-the-art OOD detection frameworks that rely on auxiliary data \\cite{sharifi2024gok}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Extensive Benchmarking:** The method was rigorously evaluated through extensive experiments on several OOD benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness across various architectures and datasets \\cite{sharifi2024gok}.\n    *   **State-of-the-Art Performance:** GReg+ achieved significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods, notably improving the FPR95 (False Positive Rate at 95% True Positive Rate) by 4% on ImageNet experiments \\cite{sharifi2024gok}.\n    *   **Ablation Studies:** Detailed ablation studies were conducted to demonstrate the individual contributions and effectiveness of both the gradient regularization and the energy-based sampling components \\cite{sharifi2024gok}.\n    *   **Empirical Gradient Norm Analysis:** Empirical results (Figure 3) illustrate that gradient regularization successfully reduces the rate of increase of the gradient norm during training without negatively impacting the reduction in energy loss, confirming its intended effect on promoting smoothness \\cite{sharifi2024gok}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   The proposed method is primarily applicable to OOD detection scenarios where an auxiliary OOD dataset is available for training or fine-tuning, rather than purely post-hoc settings \\cite{sharifi2024gok}.\n    *   The effectiveness of the energy-based sampling component is dependent on the quality and diversity of the auxiliary dataset and the appropriate selection of the number of clusters \\cite{sharifi2024gok}.\n    *   The theoretical analysis focuses on the implications of gradient regularization for smoothness and certified robustness, which represents a specific, albeit crucial, aspect of OOD detection \\cite{sharifi2024gok}.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Significant SOTA Advancement:** GReg+ substantially advances the technical state-of-the-art in OOD detection, particularly for methods leveraging auxiliary data, by achieving superior performance metrics (e.g., 4% FPR95 improvement on ImageNet) \\cite{sharifi2024gok}.\n    *   **Novel Paradigm for OOD Robustness:** Introduces a novel paradigm by explicitly incorporating local information through gradient regularization, shifting beyond mere score optimization to consider the critical aspect of score manifold smoothness and stability \\cite{sharifi2024gok}.\n    *   **Enhanced Auxiliary Data Utilization:** The energy-based sampling method offers a more effective and unbiased approach to utilize large auxiliary OOD datasets, ensuring models are exposed to diverse and truly informative outlier samples, which is vital for robust generalization \\cite{sharifi2024gok}.\n    *   **Foundation for Future Research:** The strong theoretical grounding in certified robustness and Lipschitz analysis, coupled with compelling empirical success, establishes a new direction for future research into robust OOD detection by focusing on the local properties and smoothness of neural network decision boundaries \\cite{sharifi2024gok}.",

        "title": "Outlier Synthesis via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for Out-of-Distribution Detection",
        "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for developing trustworthy and reliable machine learning systems. Recent advances in training with auxiliary OOD data demonstrate efficacy in enhancing detection capabilities. Nonetheless, these methods heavily rely on acquiring a large pool of high-quality natural outliers. Some prior methods try to alleviate this problem by synthesizing virtual outliers but suffer from either poor quality or high cost due to the monotonous sampling strategy and the heavy-parameterized generative models. In this paper, we overcome all these problems by proposing the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Outlier Synthesis (HamOS) framework, which views the synthesis process as sampling from Markov chains. Based solely on the in-distribution data, the Markov chains can extensively traverse the feature space and generate diverse and representative outliers, hence exposing the model to miscellaneous potential OOD scenarios. The Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with sampling acceptance rate almost close to 1 also makes our framework enjoy great efficiency. By empirically competing with SOTA baselines on both standard and large-scale benchmarks, we verify the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed HamOS.",

Existing virtual outlier synthesis methods often suffer from either poor quality, lack of diversity and representativeness, or high computational cost due to monotonous sampling strategies or heavy-parameterized generative models.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: OOD detection is crucial for developing trustworthy and reliable machine learning systems, especially in safety-critical applications (e.g., autonomous driving, medical imaging) where erroneous predictions on unknown data can lead to perilous situations. The challenge lies in efficiently synthesizing diverse and representative virtual outliers using *only* in-distribution (ID) data to effectively train models to distinguish between ID and OOD samples, without requiring real OOD examples.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: \\cite{li2025xv2} positions itself within regularization-based OOD detection methods, specifically those that enhance models' discriminative ability during training. It builds upon the idea of synthesizing virtual outliers to overcome the limitations of Outlier Exposure (OE) methods, which require meticulously gathered natural OOD data.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   **Outlier Exposure (OE)**: Heavily relies on acquiring a large pool of high-quality natural outliers, which is often infeasible or expensive for many domain-specific applications.\n        *   **Prior Virtual Outlier Synthesis**:\n            *   Methods generating outliers in pixel space (e.g., using GANs) are computationally expensive due to generative models.\n            *   Methods generating outliers in feature space (e.g., Gaussian sampling) often impose stringent assumptions on ID data or exclusively sample from sub-regions near decision boundaries. This leads to synthesized outliers that lack diversity and representativeness, which are crucial for effective OOD learning.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: \\cite{li2025xv2} proposes the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Outlier Synthesis (HamOS) framework. HamOS formulates the outlier synthesis process as sampling from Markov chains in a latent hyperspherical feature space, based solely on ID data.\n        *   It employs a novel **OOD-ness estimation** function, defined as the average Euclidean distance to the k-th nearest neighbors of two adjacent ID clusters. The potential energy for HMC is set as the negative logarithm of this OOD-ness.\n        *   **Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)**, specifically Spherical HMC, is used to generate a sequence of diverse and representative virtual outliers by traversing the feature space efficiently.\n        *   **Hard Margin Barrier**: To prevent erroneous outlier synthesis (i.e., generating outliers within ID clusters), \\cite{li2025xv2} introduces a hard margin in the HMC acceptance step, based on kernel density estimation (KDE) with a von Mises-Fisher kernel to approximate ID probability.\n        *   **Training**: The model is trained with a dual-head framework, utilizing an ID contrastive loss and an OOD discernment loss to learn a proper hyperspherical space that enhances ID-OOD separation.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   **First to use Markov chains for outlier synthesis**: Unlike previous methods that rely on Gaussian sampling or complex generative models, \\cite{li2025xv2} introduces a paradigm shift by explicitly sampling through Markov chains.\n        *   **Efficient and Diverse Sampling**: HMC's ability to traverse long distances in state space with high acceptance rates allows for the generation of diverse and representative outliers across a broad range of OOD characteristics and regions in the hyperspherical space.\n        *   **Solely ID-data based**: Achieves high-quality outlier synthesis without any auxiliary OOD data.\n        *   **Integrated OOD-ness and ID-likelihood**: Combines OOD-ness estimation with an ID probability-based hard margin to ensure synthesized outliers are both OOD-like and distinct from ID clusters.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**:\n        *   Introduction of a new framework for outlier synthesis via Markov chains, specifically using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, as an alternative to Gaussian sampling or generative models.\n        *   A novel OOD-ness estimation method based on k-nearest neighbor distances in hyperspherical space to guide outlier generation.\n        *   Integration of a hard margin barrier, calculated via kernel density estimation with the von Mises-Fisher kernel, into the HMC acceptance step to reject erroneous outliers within ID clusters.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: A dual-head training framework that projects feature embeddings into a reduced-dimensional hyperspherical space for outlier synthesis, while maintaining an FC head for original ID classification.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: Demonstrates that by formulating outlier synthesis as sampling from Markov chains with an OOD-ness potential energy, diverse and representative outliers can be efficiently generated, exposing the model to miscellaneous potential OOD scenarios.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Extensive empirical analysis was performed on both standard and large-scale OOD detection benchmarks.\n        *   Standard benchmarks: CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 (with five standard OOD test datasets).\n        *   Large-scale benchmark: ImageNet-1K.\n        *   Ablation studies were conducted to elucidate the intrinsic mechanism of \\cite{li2025xv2}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   **SOTA Performance**: \\cite{li2025xv2} significantly surpasses competitive baselines (both virtual outlier synthesis methods like VOS, NPOS, and regularization methods like ODINE, Energy, CSI) on all tested benchmarks.\n        *   **FPR95**: Achieved substantial improvements in FPR95 (False Positive Rate at 95% True Positive Rate for ID data). Specifically, it enhanced FPR95 on CIFAR-10 by 27.17% and on CIFAR-100 by 5.96%.\n        *   **AUROC**: Figure 1 indicates superior AUROC performance on ImageNet-1K compared to baselines.\n        *   **Diversity**: Figure 2 and Figure 4(b) demonstrate that \\cite{li2025xv2} generates outliers with a broader range of OOD scores and higher variance, indicating greater diversity. Figure 4(c) shows synthesized outliers have diverse OOD scores and low ID-likelihood.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**:\n        *   The effectiveness relies on the quality of the learned hyperspherical feature space and the accuracy of the OOD-ness estimation based on ID data distances.\n        *   The choice of hyperparameters for HMC (e.g., Leapfrog steps, step size) and the hard margin threshold `δ` can influence synthesis quality.\n        *   While efficient, HMC still involves iterative numerical approximations, which might have computational implications compared to simpler Gaussian noise injection, though \\cite{li2025xv2} claims great efficiency due to high acceptance rates.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: \\cite{li2025xv2} is a general framework compatible with various HMC variants, ID contrastive losses, and scoring functions. It is primarily applicable to scenarios where acquiring natural OOD data is difficult or impossible, and where OOD detection is critical for system reliability.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: \\cite{li2025xv2} establishes a new state-of-the-art in OOD detection by introducing a novel and effective paradigm for virtual outlier synthesis. It addresses a critical bottleneck in OOD-aware training by providing a method to generate diverse and representative outliers without relying on external OOD data.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n        *   Opens new avenues for exploring advanced sampling algorithms (beyond Gaussian distributions) for outlier synthesis in feature space.\n        *   Could inspire further research into more sophisticated OOD-ness estimation functions and adaptive hard margin strategies.\n        *   The framework's compatibility with various components suggests potential for integration with other OOD detection techniques and adaptation to different domain-specific challenges.\n        *   Contributes significantly to the development of more trustworthy and reliable machine learning systems by improving their ability to handle unknown inputs.",

[song2022f5d] *RankFeat: Rank-1 Feature Removal for Out-of-distribution Detection* (2022) introduces spectral analysis (SVD) of high-level features, identifying and removing a dominant rank-1 component. This is a more structured manipulation than simple clipping, offering theoretical insights via Random Matrix Theory. Building on the idea of leveraging intermediate features, [yu2022egq] *Block Selection Method for Using Feature Norm in Out-of-Distribution Detection* (2022) proposes `FeatureNorm` and `NormRatio` to select optimal intermediate blocks, moving beyond a sole reliance on the last layer. A significant shift towards principled intrinsic properties occurs with [ammar2023pr1] *NECO: NEural Collapse Based Out-of-distribution detection* (2023), which leverages the fundamental geometric properties of Neural Collapse (specifically, the newly identified ID/OOD Orthogonality, NC5) to define an OOD score based on projections onto the ID principal component space. This is a direct exploitation of a deep learning model's inherent training dynamics. Further refining activation manipulation, [xu2023767] *VRA: Variational Rectified Activation for Out-of-distribution Detection* (2023) moves beyond heuristic clipping (like ReAct, a baseline for RankFeat) by using variational calculus to *theoretically derive* an optimal activation function, demonstrating that a more comprehensive rectification (suppressing both low and high activations, amplifying intermediate ones) is optimal.\n\n*   *Problem evolution*: [song2022f5d] addresses the problem of OOD over-confidence by targeting a specific observed anomaly in feature representations (dominant singular value) to improve upon existing post-hoc methods. [yu2022egq] tackles the \"overconfidence issue\" prevalent in the last layer of neural networks and the practical challenge of selecting the most effective intermediate block without access to real OOD data. [ammar2023pr1] aims to unlock the potential of Neural Collapse's emergent geometric structure for OOD detection, a problem previously unexplored in this direct manner. [xu2023767] directly questions the sub-optimality of existing activation rectification methods, seeking a theoretically superior approach to maximize the ID-OOD separation gap.\n\n*   *Key innovations*: *RankFeat* introduces spectral analysis for feature manipulation and rank-1 removal. *Block Selection Method* innovates with `FeatureNorm`, `NormRatio`, and pseudo OOD generation for optimal block selection. *NECO* contributes the discovery of ID/OOD Orthogonality (NC5) and an OOD detection method based on projection onto ID principal component space. *VRA* provides the variational derivation of an optimal activation function and a comprehensive activation rectification strategy.\n\n**Trend 2: Expanding the Spectrum of OOD Signals: From Global Features to Neuron States and Explanations**\n\n*   *Methodological progression*: Initially, OOD detection primarily relied on global feature representations or output probabilities. [anthony2023slf] *On the use of Mahalanobis distance for out-of-distribution detection with neural networks for medical imaging* (2023) re-evaluates a classic distance-based method, but innovates by performing a *fine-grained layer-wise analysis* of Mahalanobis distance. This reveals that optimal detection layers are highly dependent on the specific OOD pattern, leading to the Multi-branch Mahalanobis (MBM) framework, which employs multiple depth-specific detectors. A significant conceptual leap occurs with [liu2023zb3] *Neuron Activation Coverage: Rethinking Out-of-distribution Detection and Generalization* (2023). This work shifts the focus from global features to *individual neuron states*, defining a sophisticated `ˆz` that combines raw output and gradient influence. It then introduces Neuron Activation Coverage (NAC) as a statistical measure of how well these states are \"covered\" by in-distribution data, providing a unified framework for both OOD detection and generalization. Finally, [chen2023za1] *GAIA: Delving into Gradient-based Attribution Abnormality for Out-of-distribution Detection* (2023) introduces an entirely novel class of OOD signals: *gradient-based attribution abnormality*. It observes that OOD inputs lead to \"meaningless\" or \"divergent\" explanation patterns (e.g., abnormal non-zero density, noisy channel-wise averages) and leverages these as robust OOD indicators, moving beyond internal representations to the *interpretability* of the model's decision process itself.\n\n*   *Problem evolution*: [anthony2023slf] addresses the inconsistent performance of Mahalanobis distance and challenges the flawed assumption of a single optimal layer, particularly in critical domains like medical imaging where diverse OOD patterns exist. [liu2023zb3] tackles the lack of fundamental insights into OOD root causes and the oversimplification of neuron states in previous neuron-centric approaches, aiming for a more interpretable and unified solution for both OOD detection and generalization. [chen2023za1] explores the untapped potential of model explanations as a signal for OOD detection, observing that OOD inputs break the interpretability of model decisions, a problem previously unaddressed.\n\n*   *Key innovations*: *MBM* introduces layer-wise Mahalanobis analysis and a multi-branch OOD detection system. *NAC* contributes a novel `ˆz` neuron activation state, the Neuron Activation Coverage statistical measure, and a unified framework for detection and generalization. *GAIA* pioneers the use of gradient-based attribution abnormality (zero-deflation, channel-wise average) as a novel OOD signal, providing a framework for aggregating these explanation-based abnormalities.\n\n3. *Synthesis*\nThe unified intellectual trajectory connecting these works is a continuous and deepening exploration of the internal dynamics of deep neural networks to identify robust and theoretically grounded signals for Out-of-Distribution detection. Collectively, these papers significantly advance the field by moving beyond heuristic adjustments to leverage intrinsic model properties, optimal activation functions, fine-grained feature analysis, neuron-level behavior, and even the interpretability (or lack thereof) of model explanations, thereby enhancing the reliability and safety of deep learning systems in real-world applications."

Crucially, it pioneers *unsupervised graph-level* OOD detection, moving beyond supervised or node-level approaches.

GOOD-D solves this with a principled, perturbation-free approach.\n        4.  **Limited Granularity in GCL:** Existing GCL methods often focus on instance-level contrast, failing to capture diverse OOD patterns that might manifest at node, graph, or group levels.\n    *   **Innovations/Capabilities Introduced:**\n        1.  **Formal Problem Formulation:** The first formal definition and framework for unsupervised graph-level OOD detection.\n        2.  **Novel Perturbation-Free Augmentation:** Introduces a unique strategy to generate two distinct, informative views (feature and structure) of a graph without random perturbations, preserving ID patterns.\n        3.  **Hierarchical Graph Contrastive Learning:** Develops a multi-granularity contrastive mechanism (node-level, graph-level, group-level) to learn comprehensive ID patterns and semantic manifolds.\n        4.  **Adaptive OOD Scoring:** Proposes an adaptive mechanism to aggregate contrastive errors from different granularities into a robust OOD score.\n        5.  **Benchmark Dataset:** Constructs a new, comprehensive benchmark for evaluating unsupervised graph-level OOD detection methods.\n    *   **Temporal Gaps/Clusters:** Not applicable, as only one paper is provided. This paper itself represents a foundational step in a new sub-field.\n\n2. *Evolution Analysis:*\n\n*Trend 1: Pioneering Unsupervised Out-of-Distribution Detection for Graph-Structured Data*\n\nThe field of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection has historically concentrated on grid-structured data like images and text, leaving a significant void in its application to complex, non-Euclidean graph data. The paper `GOOD-D: On Unsupervised Graph Out-Of-Distribution Detection (2022)` by `\\cite{liu202227x}` marks a pivotal moment, initiating a new trajectory by formally addressing and providing a robust solution for unsupervised OOD detection specifically at the graph level. This work doesn't just adapt existing OOD techniques; it fundamentally rethinks how OOD should be approached in the context of graphs, especially when ground-truth labels are unavailable.\n\n-   *Methodological progression*: Prior to `\\cite{liu202227x}`, graph representation learning often leveraged Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) with arbitrary data augmentations (e.g., random feature masking or edge perturbations). While effective for general representation learning, `\\cite{liu202227x}` identifies a critical flaw in this approach for OOD detection: such perturbations can inadvertently generate samples that resemble OOD data, thereby desensitizing the model to true OOD instances. GOOD-D introduces a novel methodological shift by proposing *perturbation-free graph data augmentation*. Instead of random noise, it constructs two fixed, semantically distinct views—a \"feature view\" (original graph) and a \"structure view\" (graph with structural encodings as features)—ensuring that the generated views consistently represent the In-Distribution (ID) data manifold. This principled approach to view generation is a cornerstone for robust OOD detection in graphs. Furthermore, `\\cite{liu202227x}` moves beyond simple instance-level contrast by developing a *hierarchical graph contrastive learning* framework. This multi-granularity approach, encompassing node-level, graph-level, and group-level contrast, allows the model to capture a more comprehensive understanding of ID patterns, which is crucial for detecting diverse OOD deviations.\n\n-   *Problem evolution*: The primary problem `\\cite{liu202227x}` addresses is the glaring absence of effective OOD detection mechanisms for graph-structured data. Deep learning models, when deployed in open-world scenarios, frequently encounter inputs that deviate from their training distribution. While this problem was recognized for images and text, graphs—prevalent in social networks, biology, and chemistry—remained largely unaddressed. Moreover, the paper tackles the practical challenge of *label scarcity* in graph datasets, making unsupervised methods not just desirable but essential. By focusing on unsupervised graph-level OOD detection, `\\cite{liu202227x}` directly confronts the limitations of supervised methods and node-level anomaly detection, which are often too narrow or resource-intensive for general graph OOD. The paper also explicitly resolves the problem of GCL's standard augmentation strategies being counterproductive for OOD detection, a nuanced but critical insight.\n\n-   *Key innovations*: The most significant innovation of `\\cite{liu202227x}` is the formal problem formulation of unsupervised graph-level OOD detection itself, establishing a new research frontier. The proposed GOOD-D framework, with its *perturbation-free augmentation* and *hierarchical graph contrastive learning*, represents a breakthrough in learning robust ID representations for graphs. The adaptive OOD scoring mechanism, which intelligently aggregates multi-level contrastive errors, provides a practical and effective way to quantify OODness. Finally, the construction of a comprehensive benchmark dataset for this novel problem space is a crucial contribution, enabling standardized evaluation and fostering future research. These innovations collectively enable the capability to identify anomalous or out-of-distribution graphs without requiring any prior knowledge of OOD classes or labels, significantly enhancing the trustworthiness and reliability of graph AI systems.\n\n3. *Synthesis:*\n\nThe unified intellectual trajectory connecting `GOOD-D: On Unsupervised Graph Out-Of-Distribution Detection (2022)` by `\\cite{liu202227x}` is the expansion of Out-of-Distribution detection capabilities to new, complex data modalities and challenging unsupervised settings. Its collective contribution is pioneering the field of unsupervised graph-level OOD detection, providing a foundational framework, novel methodologies, and a benchmark that are critical for advancing trustworthy graph AI.",

        "abstract": "Most existing deep learning models are trained based on the closed-world assumption, where the test data is assumed to be drawn i.i.d. from the same distribution as the training data, known as in-distribution (ID). However, when models are deployed in an open-world scenario, test samples can be out-of-distribution (OOD) and therefore should be handled with caution. To detect such OOD samples drawn from unknown distribution, OOD detection has received increasing attention lately. However, current endeavors mostly focus on grid-structured data and its application for graph-structured data remains under-explored. Considering the fact that data labeling on graphs is commonly time-expensive and labor-intensive, in this work we study the problem of unsupervised graph OOD detection, aiming at detecting OOD graphs solely based on unlabeled ID data. To achieve this goal, we develop a new graph contrastive learning framework GOOD-D for detecting OOD graphs without using any ground-truth labels. By performing hierarchical contrastive learning on the augmented graphs generated by our perturbation-free graph data augmentation method, GOOD-D is able to capture the latent ID patterns and accurately detect OOD graphs based on the semantic inconsistency in different granularities (i.e., node-level, graph-level, and group-level). As a pioneering work in unsupervised graph-level OOD detection, we build a comprehensive benchmark to compare our proposed approach with different state-of-the-art methods. The experiment results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over different methods on various datasets.",

    "summary": "2. *Evolution Analysis:*\n\nThe evolution of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection research, as traced through these 14 interconnected papers, reveals two overarching trends: an initial focus on **exploiting intrinsic model signals and actively engineering feature spaces for efficiency and robustness**, followed by a significant shift towards **advancing OOD detection through foundation models, synthetic exposure, and theoretical rigor**.\n\n### Trend 1: Exploiting Intrinsic Model Signals and Actively Engineering Feature Spaces for Efficiency and Robustness\n\n*   **Methodological progression**: The journey began with **[dong2021swz] Neural Mean Discrepancy for Efficient Out-of-Distribution Detection (2021)**, which pioneered the use of *off-the-shelf Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as efficient kernels for Integral Probability Metrics (IPMs)*. This marked a shift towards leveraging inherent model properties, specifically Batch Normalization's running averages, for \"free\" OOD detection. This idea of repurposing existing model capabilities evolved into **[wang2022mbf] Watermarking for Out-of-distribution Detection (2022)**, which introduced *data-level reprogramming* via a universal static watermark to enhance OOD scoring functions without altering model parameters. Further, **[yang2022ci8] Out-of-Distribution Detection with Semantic Mismatch under Masking (2022)** moved towards *semantic consistency checks* using class-conditional generative models, maintaining a plug-and-play approach. A deeper dive into model internals was seen in **[chen2023za1] GAIA: Delving into Gradient-based Attribution Abnormality for Out-of-distribution Detection (2023)**, which leveraged *abnormalities in gradient-based attribution results* as a novel OOD signal. The theoretical understanding of deep learning phenomena, specifically Neural Collapse (NC), became a direct methodological tool with **[ammar2023pr1] NECO: NEural Collapse Based Out-of-distribution detection (2023)**, which identified and exploited the *ID/OOD Orthogonality (NC5)* property. This then progressed to *actively enforcing* NC-based feature separation during training with **[wu20242p3] Pursuing Feature Separation based on Neural Collapse for Out-of-Distribution Detection (2024)**, using novel separation and clustering losses. Finally, **[shin2024lnf] Representation Norm Amplification for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Long-Tail Learning (2024)** introduced a *decoupling strategy* for long-tail OOD, using representation norm amplification.\n\n*   **Problem evolution**: Early on, **[dong2021swz] (2021)** tackled the *computational overhead and inefficiency* of existing OOD methods, especially for single-example detection. **[wang2022mbf] (2022)** addressed the problem of *overconfidence in OODs* and the *difficulty of acquiring OOD data* by proposing a method that works without explicit OOD samples. **[yang2022ci8] (2022)** focused on the failure of density/reconstruction methods to capture *semantic differences*, leading to misjudgments. **[chen2023za1] (2023)** sought more robust OOD signals by observing the *meaningless explanations* models provide for OOD inputs. **[ammar2023pr1] (2023)** aimed to directly leverage the *geometric properties of Neural Collapse* for OOD detection, which previous work had only observed. **[wu20242p3] (2024)** identified a critical gap where methods using auxiliary OOD data (like Outlier Exposure) only focused on *output space separation*, neglecting the more effective *feature space separation*. The specific, complex problem of *OOD detection in long-tailed datasets* and the trade-off between ID classification and OOD performance was addressed by **[shin2024lnf] (2024)**.\n\n*   **Key innovations**: **[dong2021swz] (2021)** introduced Neural Mean Discrepancy (NMD) and the \"free lunch\" from Batch Normalization, enabling highly efficient OOD detection. **[wang2022mbf] (2022)** innovated with the first application of model reprogramming for OOD detection via a universal, static watermark learned without explicit OOD data. **[yang2022ci8] (2022)**'s MoodCat brought the novel concept of semantic mismatch under masking using conditional synthesis. **[chen2023za1] (2023)** pioneered the use of gradient-based attribution abnormality as a training-free OOD signal. **[ammar2023pr1] (2023)**'s key contribution was the discovery and empirical validation of ID/OOD Orthogonality (NC5) and its direct application in NECO. **[wu20242p3] (2024)** introduced the novel concept of *explicit feature separation* using `LSep` and `LClu` losses, guided by Neural Collapse. **[shin2024lnf] (2024)**'s RNA provided a unique training method to decouple OOD detection and classification in long-tail settings by amplifying representation norms.\n\n### Trend 2: Advancing OOD Detection through Foundation Models, Synthetic Exposure, and Theoretical Rigor\n\n*   **Methodological progression**: This trend marks a significant shift, particularly with the advent of powerful foundation models. **[cao20246gj] Envisioning Outlier Exposure by Large Language Models for Out-of-Distribution Detection (2024)** pioneered the use of *Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic outlier class labels* for \"envisioned outlier exposure\" in zero-shot Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based OOD detection. This concept of synthetic OOD exposure was then extended to complex data modalities with **[wang2025xwm] GOLD: Graph Out-of-Distribution Detection via Implicit Adversarial Latent Generation (2025)**, which introduced an *implicit adversarial learning framework* to generate pseudo-OOD features for graph data without real OOD samples or pre-trained graph generative models. Complementing these practical advancements, the field also saw a push for *theoretical grounding and clearer categorization*. **[du2024aea] When and How Does In-Distribution Label Help Out-of-Distribution Detection? (2024)** provided a *formal analytical framework using graph theory and spectral decomposition* to answer a fundamental question about ID labels. Finally, two survey papers, **[miyai20247ro] Generalized Out-of-Distribution Detection and Beyond in Vision Language Model Era: A Survey (2024)** and **[lu2024j0n] Out-of-Distribution Detection: A Task-Oriented Survey of Recent Advances (2024)**, emerged to *organize and clarify* the rapidly evolving landscape, with **[miyai20247ro]** focusing on the VLM era and **[lu2024j0n]** on a task-oriented taxonomy.\n\n*   **Problem evolution**: **[cao20246gj] (2024)** directly addressed the limitation of zero-shot VLM-based OOD detection, which relied solely on closed-set ID labels and struggled with \"hard\" OODs due to the *unavailability of actual OOD data*. **[wang2025xwm] (2025)** tackled a similar data scarcity problem but for *graph-structured data*, where existing OOD synthesis methods from images were inapplicable. Simultaneously, **[du2024aea] (2024)** addressed a *fundamental theoretical gap* by formally investigating the impact of ID labels on OOD detection, a distinction often blurred with anomaly detection. The proliferation of methods and the impact of VLMs created a *problem of clarity and unified understanding* in the field, which **[miyai20247ro] (2024)** and **[lu2024j0n] (2024)** sought to resolve through comprehensive surveys and novel taxonomies.\n\n*   **Key innovations**: **[cao20246gj] (2024)**'s EOE was a breakthrough, demonstrating the power of LLMs to *synthetically generate outlier exposure* and significantly improving zero-shot OOD detection. **[wang2025xwm] (2025)**'s GOLD introduced a novel *implicit adversarial learning framework for synthetic OOD exposure in graphs*, overcoming the lack of pre-trained generative models for this modality. **[du2024aea] (2024)** provided the first *provable error bound* and identified *sufficient conditions* for the benefit of ID labels in OOD detection. **[miyai20247ro] (2024)** contributed \"Generalized OOD Detection v2,\" a new unified framework for the VLM era, and the first comprehensive review of VLM-based OOD methods. **[lu2024j0n] (2024)** introduced a novel *task-oriented taxonomy*, offering a practical lens for understanding OOD advances.\n\n3. *Synthesis*:\nThe collective intellectual trajectory of these works demonstrates a continuous drive to make Out-of-Distribution Detection more robust, efficient, and applicable in real-world open-set scenarios. Researchers have moved from cleverly leveraging intrinsic signals within pre-trained models and actively engineering feature spaces, to harnessing the power of foundation models for synthetic OOD data generation, all while simultaneously deepening the theoretical understanding and clarifying the taxonomic landscape of the field. Their collective contribution is a significant advancement in building more reliable and trustworthy AI systems capable of recognizing and appropriately handling unknown inputs.",

        "abstract": "Various approaches have been proposed for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection by augmenting models, input examples, training sets, and optimization objectives. Deviating from existing work, we have a simple hypothesis that standard off-the-shelf models may already contain sufficient information about the training set distribution which can be leveraged for reliable OOD detection. Our empirical study on validating this hypothesis, which measures the model activation's mean for OOD and in-distribution (ID) minibatches, surprisingly finds that activation means of OOD mini-batches consistently deviate more from those of the training data. In addition, training data's activation means can be computed offline efficiently or retrieved from batch normalization layers as a ‘free lunch’. Based upon this observation, we propose a novel metric called Neural Mean Discrepancy (NMD), which compares neural means of the input examples and training data. Leveraging the simplicity of NMD, we propose an efficient OOD detector that computes neural means by a standard forward pass followed by a lightweight classifier. Extensive experiments show that NMD outperforms state-of-the-art OOD approaches across multiple datasets and model architectures in terms of both detection accuracy and computational cost.",

        "abstract": "Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is a critical challenge in machine learning due to model overconfidence, often without awareness of their epistemological limits. We hypothesize that ``neural collapse'', a phenomenon affecting in-distribution data for models trained beyond loss convergence, also influences OOD data. To benefit from this interplay, we introduce NECO, a novel post-hoc method for OOD detection, which leverages the geometric properties of ``neural collapse'' and of principal component spaces to identify OOD data. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that NECO achieves state-of-the-art results on both small and large-scale OOD detection tasks while exhibiting strong generalization capabilities across different network architectures. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical explanation for the effectiveness of our method in OOD detection. Code is available at https://gitlab.com/drti/neco",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review, adhering to your requirements:\n\n### NECO: NEURAL COLLAPSE BASED OUT-OF-DISTRIBUTION DETECTION \\cite{ammar2023pr1}\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Problem**: Deep learning models exhibit unwarranted overconfidence when confronted with Out-of-Distribution (OOD) inputs, failing to recognize data outside their training distribution.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge**: This vulnerability poses significant safety implications in critical applications like medical imaging, industrial inspection, and autonomous driving, where models must not only classify known In-Distribution (ID) samples but also reliably flag OOD inputs as \"unknown.\" The challenge lies in developing effective, post-hoc OOD detection methods that do not alter the network training or harm performance.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing OOD Approaches**: The paper categorizes existing OOD detection methods into confidence-based (e.g., Softmax, Energy, ODIN), features/logits-based, and distance/density-based (e.g., Mahalanobis, nearest-neighbor). It specifically focuses on *post-hoc (unsupervised)* methods, which are desirable for seamless integration into production models without increased training cost.\n    *   **Neural Collapse (NC)**: Previous studies have identified \"Neural Collapse\" (NC) as a phenomenon in DNNs trained beyond loss convergence, characterized by within-class variability collapse (NC1), convergence of class means to a Simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) (NC2), self-duality (NC3), and simplification to nearest class-center classification (NC4).\n    *   **Limitations of Previous NC-OOD Work**: While Haas et al. (2023) demonstrated that collapsed models exhibit improved OOD detection, no prior work has directly leveraged the emergent geometric properties of NC for OOD detection.\n    *   **Positioning NECO**: NECO falls within the feature/logit-based post-hoc OOD methods. It relates to methods like NuSA and ViM, which also leverage principal/null spaces for OOD detection, but introduces a novel approach based on a newly observed NC property.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: NECO (NEural Collapse-based Out-of-distribution detection) is a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that leverages the geometric properties of Neural Collapse, particularly a newly identified property, and principal component spaces.\n    *   **Novel Observation (NC5)**: The paper introduces and empirically validates a novel property of Neural Collapse: **ID/OOD Orthogonality (NC5)**. This property states that as training progresses, OOD and ID data tend to become increasingly orthogonal to each other, meaning OOD data clusters become more perpendicular to the Simplex ETF configuration adopted by ID data. Mathematically, `∀c,⟨µc, µOOD_G⟩ / (∥µc∥2∥µOOD_G∥2) → 0`.\n    *   **NECO Score Calculation**: Building on NC5, NECO computes an OOD score for a sample `x` by calculating the relative norm of its feature vector `hω(x)` within the subspace occupied by the Simplex ETF structure. This is achieved by projecting `hω(x)` onto the principal component space derived from the ID training data's feature covariance matrix.\n        *   `NECO(x) = ∥P hω(x)∥ / ∥hω(x)∥ = sqrt(hω(x)⊤ PP⊤ hω(x)) / sqrt(hω(x)⊤ hω(x))`\n        *   Here, `P` is the projection matrix onto the `d` principal components extracted from the ID data's feature space `H`.\n    *   **Innovation over Related Work**: Unlike NuSA and ViM, which identify and utilize the *null space* (the component of the feature vector that does not directly impact classification) for OOD detection, NECO directly leverages the *principal component space* of the ID data. The hypothesis is that if NC1, NC2, and NC5 hold, OOD data, being orthogonal to ID data, will have a near-null projection onto the ID-derived principal space, while ID data will have a significant projection.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Theoretical Insight**: Introduction and empirical validation of the **ID/OOD Orthogonality (NC5)** property of Neural Collapse, demonstrating that OOD data becomes increasingly orthogonal to ID data's class means during the Terminal Phase of Training.\n    *   **Novel Algorithm/Method**: Proposal of **NECO**, a straightforward yet highly efficient post-hoc OOD detection method that directly leverages the geometric implications of Neural Collapse and the principal component space of ID data.\n    *   **Theoretical Analysis**: The paper provides a theoretical explanation for the effectiveness of NECO in OOD detection, linking its mechanism to the established and newly proposed NC properties.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Validation of NC5**: Experiments were conducted to validate the ID/OOD orthogonality (NC5) using CIFAR-10 as the ID dataset and CIFAR-100/SVHN as OOD datasets, employing ResNet-18 and ViT architectures. Results (Figure 1) show the `OrthoDev classes −OOD` metric consistently decreasing towards zero, confirming the convergence to ID/OOD orthogonality during training.\n    *   **NECO Performance**: The abstract states that NECO achieves **state-of-the-art results** on both small and large-scale OOD detection tasks.\n    *   **Generalization**: NECO exhibits **strong generalization capabilities** across different network architectures, including ResNet-18 on CIFAR10/CIFAR100 and Vision Transformer (ViT) networks on ImageNet-1K.\n    *   **Key Metrics**: While specific metrics are not detailed in the provided text, OOD detection performance is typically evaluated using metrics like AUROC, AUPR, and FPR@95%TPR.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Scope**: The method is specifically designed as a *post-hoc (unsupervised)* OOD detection approach, meaning it does not require modifications to the network training procedure or access to OOD samples during training.\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The effectiveness of NECO relies on the assumption that the underlying DNN exhibits Neural Collapse properties (NC1, NC2) and the newly proposed ID/OOD orthogonality (NC5). The paper does not explicitly state other technical limitations in the provided text.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: NECO advances the technical state-of-the-art in post-hoc OOD detection by introducing a novel, theoretically grounded approach that leverages the intrinsic geometric properties of deep neural networks during their terminal training phase.\n    *   **Impact on Future Research**: The discovery and empirical validation of ID/OOD orthogonality (NC5) provide a new fundamental insight into DNN behavior in the presence of OOD data, potentially opening new avenues for research in OOD detection, robustness, and understanding deep learning generalization. Its simplicity and efficiency make it a promising candidate for integration into safety-critical applications.",

However, existing methods largely ignore the reprogramming property of deep models and thus may not fully unleash their intrinsic strength: without modifying parameters of a well-trained deep model, we can reprogram this model for a new purpose via data-level manipulation (e.g., adding a specific feature perturbation to the data). This property motivates us to reprogram a classification model to excel at OOD detection (a new task), and thus we propose a general methodology named watermarking in this paper. Specifically, we learn a unified pattern that is superimposed onto features of original data, and the model's detection capability is largely boosted after watermarking. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of watermarking, demonstrating the significance of the reprogramming property of deep models in OOD detection.",

Research Problem & Motivation**\n\n*   **Specific Technical Problem:** Existing Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection methods largely overlook the \"reprogramming property\" of deep models, failing to fully exploit their inherent capabilities. Deep models often exhibit overconfidence in OOD inputs, which is critical to address in safety-critical applications.\n*   **Importance and Challenge:** OOD detection is crucial for reliable deep learning systems in open-world scenarios. The problem is challenging because acquiring true OOD data for training is difficult and costly, and re-training large deep models is often prohibitively expensive. The paper aims to address these challenges by repurposing existing, well-trained models without modifying their parameters.\n\n**2. Related Work & Positioning**\n\n*   **Relation to Existing Approaches:**\n    *   The work builds upon classification-based OOD detection methods that use scoring functions derived from well-trained models (e.g., softmax, free energy).\n    *   It draws inspiration from \"model reprogramming,\" a technique that repurposes pre-trained models for new tasks via data-level manipulation (e.g., static padding patterns) without altering model parameters, previously applied in image classification and time-series analysis.\n*   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n    *   Prior OOD detection methods primarily rely on adjusting a detection threshold, which is insufficient when ID and OOD score distributions overlap significantly.\n    *   Other OOD approaches (density-based, distance-based) often face computational complexity and optimization difficulties.\n    *   Crucially, previous OOD detection research has not explored the potential of the \"reprogramming property\" of deep models for this task.\n    *   Methods like ODIN \\cite{liang2018enhancing} use instance-specific perturbations requiring extra test-time computation and are often tied to specific scoring functions, unlike the proposed static, universal watermark.\n\n**3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n\n*   **Core Technical Method:** The paper proposes \"watermarking\" \\cite{wang2022mbf}, a novel methodology that reprograms a well-trained classification model for OOD detection. It involves learning a *unified, static pattern* (the watermark `w`) that is superimposed onto original inputs (`x + w`) at test time. This data-level manipulation aims to enhance pre-defined OOD scoring functions by enlarging the score gap between ID and OOD data.\n*   **Novelty/Difference:**\n    *   **First Application of Reprogramming to OOD Detection:** This is the primary innovation, demonstrating a new paradigm for OOD detection by leveraging a model's intrinsic capabilities without parameter modification.\n    *   **Learning a Universal, Static Watermark:** Unlike dynamic, instance-specific perturbations, the watermark is learned once and applied universally, eliminating test-time computational overhead.\n    *   **Learning Strategy without Explicit OOD Data:** The watermark is learned by optimizing two objectives: (1) making the model produce high scores for watermarked in-distribution (ID) data, and (2) regularizing the watermark such that the model returns low scores when only the watermark (or watermark + noise) is perceived, simulating OOD conditions where no ID pattern is recognized.\n    *   **Robust Optimization with SAM:** The learning process incorporates Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) \\cite{foret2020sharpness} to find watermarks that lead to a smoother loss landscape, improving robustness and generalization.\n    *   **Generalizability:** The approach is designed to be compatible with various classification-based scoring functions (e.g., softmax, free energy), offering broad applicability.\n\n**4. Key Technical Contributions**\n\n*   **Novel Methodology:** Introduction of \"watermarking\" as a data-level reprogramming strategy for OOD detection, exploiting the inherent capabilities of pre-trained deep models.\n*   **Principled Learning Framework:** A framework for learning effective watermarks without requiring explicit OOD data, using distinct loss functions for ID (maximizing scores for `x+w`) and OOD (minimizing scores for `epsilon+w`, where `epsilon` is noise) scenarios.\n*   **Advanced Optimization:** Integration of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) \\cite{foret2020sharpness} with signum gradient updates for robust and efficient watermark learning, aiming for solutions with smooth loss landscapes.\n*   **Adaptable Loss Functions:** Specific realizations of loss functions for popular OOD scoring methods (softmax-based and free-energy-based watermarking), demonstrating the method's versatility.\n\n**5.

Compared to existing solutions, MoodCat naturally learns the semantic information of the in-distribution data with the proposed mask and conditional synthesis strategy, which is critical to identifying OODs. Experimental results demonstrate that MoodCat outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection solutions by a large margin.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review, emphasizing technical innovations and empirical validation:\n\n*   **1. Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) operate under a \"close-world\" assumption, making them vulnerable to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) samples in real-world \"open-world\" deployments. OOD samples can lead to highly confident but incorrect predictions, posing significant safety and reliability challenges for DNNs \\cite{yang2022ci8}.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: Distinguishing OOD samples from in-distribution (In-D) data is crucial for safe DNN deployment. Existing methods face challenges: feature-sharing strategies often trade off In-D accuracy for OOD detection, density-based methods' probabilistic measures can be untrustworthy (assigning high likelihood to OODs), and reconstruction-based methods may faithfully reconstruct OODs, leading to misjudgments \\cite{yang2022ci8}.\n\n*   **2. Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: MoodCat \\cite{yang2022ci8} is positioned as a novel distance-based OOD detection framework, distinct from classification-based, density-based, and traditional reconstruction-based methods. It is inspired by adversarial example detection but adapts the concept for OODs, which are semantically different rather than imperceptibly perturbed In-D samples.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   **Classification-based**: Often alter the original classifier's training, reducing In-D accuracy \\cite{yang2022ci8}.\n        *   **Density-based**: Learned density models may assign high likelihood to OODs, as measures can be dominated by low-level features rather than high-level semantics \\cite{yang2022ci8}.\n        *   **Reconstruction-based**: Assume OODs cannot be well-reconstructed, but this is not always true, as they don't explicitly consider semantics. They focus on pixel-level quality degradation, which isn't guaranteed for OODs \\cite{yang2022ci8}.\n        *   **Open Set Recognition (OSR)**: While some OSR methods use generative models, they differ significantly; e.g., some use GANs for data augmentation, others identify outliers based on reconstruction errors requiring K-time inference, or detect in latent space, whereas MoodCat detects in image space based on semantic contradiction \\cite{yang2022ci8}.\n\n*   **3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: MoodCat \\cite{yang2022ci8} operates in three stages:\n        1.  **Random Masking**: A random portion of the input image `x` is masked to create `xm`. This removes redundant information and encourages the generative model to synthesize new content.\n        2.  **Generative Synthesis**: A generative model `G` (an Encoder-Decoder architecture) synthesizes a new image `x'` from `xm`, *conditioned on the classification result `y`* (predicted label from the target classifier). The encoder extracts low-level features, and the decoder uses class-conditional batch normalization to ensure `x'` aligns with the semantic meaning of `y`.\n        3.  **Anomalous Scoring**: An anomalous scoring model measures the semantic difference between the original image `x` and the synthesized image `x'` for OOD detection.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   **Semantic Mismatch under Masking**: The core innovation is leveraging the semantic mismatch that arises when an OOD sample (with an irrelevant predicted label) is used to conditionally synthesize a masked image. For In-D, the synthesis is faithful; for OOD, the synthesis dramatically differs from the original, spotlighting the contradiction \\cite{yang2022ci8}.\n        *   **Conditional Synthesis vs. Reconstruction**: Unlike reconstruction-based methods, MoodCat *synthesizes* an image consistent with a *given label* rather than merely reconstructing the input. This aligns with the generative model's objective and highlights semantic discrepancies \\cite{yang2022ci8}.\n        *   **Plug-and-Play**: MoodCat is a standalone detector that does not require fine-tuning the original classifier, preserving its accuracy and allowing easy integration \\cite{yang2022ci8}.\n\n*   **4.

In this paper, we offer an innovative perspective on quantifying the disparities between in-distribution (ID) and OOD data -- analyzing the uncertainty that arises when models attempt to explain their predictive decisions. This perspective is motivated by our observation that gradient-based attribution methods encounter challenges in assigning feature importance to OOD data, thereby yielding divergent explanation patterns. Consequently, we investigate how attribution gradients lead to uncertain explanation outcomes and introduce two forms of abnormalities for OOD detection: the zero-deflation abnormality and the channel-wise average abnormality. We then propose GAIA, a simple and effective approach that incorporates Gradient Abnormality Inspection and Aggregation. The effectiveness of GAIA is validated on both commonly utilized (CIFAR) and large-scale (ImageNet-1k) benchmarks.

        "abstract": "Despite graph neural networks' (GNNs) great success in modelling graph-structured data, out-of-distribution (OOD) test instances still pose a great challenge for current GNNs. One of the most effective techniques to detect OOD nodes is to expose the detector model with an additional OOD node-set, yet the extra OOD instances are often difficult to obtain in practice. Recent methods for image data address this problem using OOD data synthesis, typically relying on pre-trained generative models like Stable Diffusion. However, these approaches require vast amounts of additional data, as well as one-for-all pre-trained generative models, which are not available for graph data. Therefore, we propose the GOLD framework for graph OOD detection, an implicit adversarial learning pipeline with synthetic OOD exposure without pre-trained models. The implicit adversarial training process employs a novel alternating optimisation framework by training: (1) a latent generative model to regularly imitate the in-distribution (ID) embeddings from an evolving GNN, and (2) a GNN encoder and an OOD detector to accurately classify ID data while increasing the energy divergence between the ID embeddings and the generative model's synthetic embeddings. This novel approach implicitly transforms the synthetic embeddings into pseudo-OOD instances relative to the ID data, effectively simulating exposure to OOD scenarios without auxiliary data. Extensive OOD detection experiments are conducted on five benchmark graph datasets, verifying the superior performance of GOLD without using real OOD data compared with the state-of-the-art OOD exposure and non-exposure baselines.",

        "title": "Pursuing Feature Separation based on Neural Collapse for Out-of-Distribution Detection",
        "abstract": "In the open world, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data, whose labels are disjoint with those of in-distribution (ID) samples, is important for reliable deep neural networks (DNNs). To achieve better detection performance, one type of approach proposes to fine-tune the model with auxiliary OOD datasets to amplify the difference between ID and OOD data through a separation loss defined on model outputs. However, none of these studies consider enlarging the feature disparity, which should be more effective compared to outputs. The main difficulty lies in the diversity of OOD samples, which makes it hard to describe their feature distribution, let alone design losses to separate them from ID features. In this paper, we neatly fence off the problem based on an aggregation property of ID features named Neural Collapse (NC). NC means that the penultimate features of ID samples within a class are nearly identical to the last layer weight of the corresponding class. Based on this property, we propose a simple but effective loss called Separation Loss, which binds the features of OOD data in a subspace orthogonal to the principal subspace of ID features formed by NC. In this way, the features of ID and OOD samples are separated by different dimensions. By optimizing the feature separation loss rather than purely enlarging output differences, our detection achieves SOTA performance on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks without any additional data augmentation or sampling, demonstrating the importance of feature separation in OOD detection. Code is available at https://github.com/Wuyingwen/Pursuing-Feature-Separation-for-OOD-Detection.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **1. Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Problem**: Detecting Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data is crucial for reliable deep neural networks (DNNs) in open-world scenarios, especially in safety-critical applications.\n    *   **Challenge**: Models trained solely on in-distribution (ID) data often make over-confident predictions on OOD data, and OOD features tend to intermingle with ID features. Existing methods that use auxiliary OOD datasets primarily focus on amplifying differences in the *output space*, neglecting the *feature space*. Designing effective feature separation losses for diverse OOD samples is difficult due to their varied and dispersed feature distributions.\n\n*   **2. Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation**: This work builds upon methods that utilize auxiliary OOD datasets to fine-tune models, such as Outlier Exposure (OE) \\cite{wu20242p3} and Energy-based methods \\cite{wu20242p3}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Previous approaches (e.g., OE, Energy method) primarily focus on increasing the *output discrepancy* between ID and OOD samples. None of these studies explicitly consider enhancing separability in the *feature space*, which is argued to be more effective. Traditional feature separation losses (e.g., dispersion loss, KL divergence) are unsuitable for OOD data due to their inherent diversity and dispersed feature distributions.\n\n*   **3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: \\cite{wu20242p3} proposes a novel \"Separation Loss\" (`LSep`) to explicitly separate ID and OOD features in the feature space.\n    *   **Innovation**: The approach leverages the \"Neural Collapse (NC)\" property \\cite{wu20242p3} of ID features, which states that penultimate features of ID samples within a class are nearly identical to the last layer weight of the corresponding class.\n    *   **Mechanism**: Based on NC, \\cite{wu20242p3} constrains OOD features to lie in a subspace *orthogonal* to the principal subspace of ID features (which is spanned by the FC layer weights). This ensures ID and OOD features are separated by different dimensions.\n    *   **Loss Formulation**: The `LSep` calculates the average absolute value of the cosine similarity between normalized OOD features and the normalized weights of the final FC layer, aiming to minimize this to zero.\n    *   **Assistant Loss**: An additional \"Clustering Loss\" (`LClu`) is introduced for ID data, encouraging ID features within a class to align closely with their corresponding FC weight, thereby promoting the Neural Collapse phenomenon and making ID features more clustered.\n    *   **Overall Objective**: The final training objective combines standard cross-entropy for ID data, Outlier Exposure loss for auxiliary OOD data, and the proposed `LClu` and `LSep` losses.\n\n*   **4. Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Concept**: First to propose the concept of *feature separation* when fine-tuning models with auxiliary OOD data, shifting the focus from output separation.\n    *   **Novel Loss Function**: Introduction of the `Separation Loss` (`LSep`) that leverages the Neural Collapse property of ID features to constrain OOD features to an orthogonal subspace.\n    *   **Assistant Loss**: Development of the `Clustering Loss` (`LClu`) to enhance ID feature compactness and reinforce Neural Collapse.\n    *   **Methodological Framework**: Provides a simple yet effective framework that can be widely applied as a stronger baseline and seamlessly integrated with existing auxiliary OOD data approaches.\n\n*   **5. Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments**: Extensive experiments were conducted on representative OOD detection setups.\n    *   **Benchmarks**: Evaluated on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet datasets.\n    *   **Key Metrics**: Performance was measured using FPR95 (False Positive Rate at 95% True Positive Rate) and AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve).\n    *   **Results**: Achieves State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance without requiring additional data augmentation or sampling algorithms.\n        *   For example, on the CIFAR100 benchmark, \\cite{wu20242p3} achieved an average FPR95 of 29.58% and AUROC of 94.01%, outperforming the traditional Outlier Exposure (OE) method by 8.19% on FPR95.\n    *   **Visualizations**: Feature visualizations (e.g., Figure 2) empirically demonstrate that the proposed method significantly increases the separability between ID and OOD features compared to vanilla and OE-trained models.\n\n*   **6. Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Assumptions**: The method's effectiveness relies on the Neural Collapse property holding for the ID data and model architecture.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: Primarily applicable to scenarios where auxiliary OOD datasets are available for fine-tuning. It can serve as a stronger baseline for methods that currently use OE loss.\n\n*   **7. Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement**: Advances the technical state-of-the-art in OOD detection by achieving SOTA performance on standard benchmarks.\n    *   **New Insights**: Provides new insights into OOD detection by demonstrating the critical importance of feature separation over mere output separation.\n    *   **Future Research Impact**: The proposed feature separation loss can serve as a stronger and more effective baseline for future research in OOD detection, particularly for methods utilizing auxiliary OOD data. It opens avenues for exploring feature space manipulation guided by ID data properties.",

        "abstract": "Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential when deploying machine learning models in open-world scenarios. Zero-shot OOD detection, requiring no training on in-distribution (ID) data, has been possible with the advent of vision-language models like CLIP. Existing methods build a text-based classifier with only closed-set labels. However, this largely restricts the inherent capability of CLIP to recognize samples from large and open label space. In this paper, we propose to tackle this constraint by leveraging the expert knowledge and reasoning capability of large language models (LLM) to Envision potential Outlier Exposure, termed EOE, without access to any actual OOD data. Owing to better adaptation to open-world scenarios, EOE can be generalized to different tasks, including far, near, and fine-grained OOD detection. Technically, we design (1) LLM prompts based on visual similarity to generate potential outlier class labels specialized for OOD detection, as well as (2) a new score function based on potential outlier penalty to distinguish hard OOD samples effectively. Empirically, EOE achieves state-of-the-art performance across different OOD tasks and can be effectively scaled to the ImageNet-1K dataset.

This restriction hinders their ability to recognize samples from a large, open label space and effectively distinguish \"hard\" OOD samples.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** OOD detection is crucial for deploying machine learning models safely and reliably in open-world scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving) where encountering unknown data is common. The challenge lies in improving OOD detection performance without access to actual OOD data during training or inference, as such data is inherently unknown and unavailable in practical settings.

        "title": "When and How Does In-Distribution Label Help Out-of-Distribution Detection?",
        "abstract": "Detecting data points deviating from the training distribution is pivotal for ensuring reliable machine learning. Extensive research has been dedicated to the challenge, spanning classical anomaly detection techniques to contemporary out-of-distribution (OOD) detection approaches. While OOD detection commonly relies on supervised learning from a labeled in-distribution (ID) dataset, anomaly detection may treat the entire ID data as a single class and disregard ID labels. This fundamental distinction raises a significant question that has yet to be rigorously explored: when and how does ID label help OOD detection? This paper bridges this gap by offering a formal understanding to theoretically delineate the impact of ID labels on OOD detection. We employ a graph-theoretic approach, rigorously analyzing the separability of ID data from OOD data in a closed-form manner. Key to our approach is the characterization of data representations through spectral decomposition on the graph. Leveraging these representations, we establish a provable error bound that compares the OOD detection performance with and without ID labels, unveiling conditions for achieving enhanced OOD detection.

    "summary": "\n2. *Evolution Analysis:*\n\nThe evolution of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, particularly within distance-based methods, has been significantly shaped by the quest for more accurate and robust representations of in-distribution (ID) data. The work presented in \"[lu20249d4] Learning with Mixture of Prototypes for Out-of-Distribution Detection (2024)\" marks a crucial advancement by addressing fundamental limitations in how ID data is modeled, leading to more discriminative OOD detection. This paper highlights two major trends: the shift towards sophisticated ID data modeling and the enhancement of representation learning through advanced loss functions.\n\n*Trend 1: Moving Beyond Simplistic ID Data Modeling for OOD Detection*\n- *Methodological progression*: Early distance-based OOD detection methods, including recent advancements leveraging deep representation learning and von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions (e.g., [ming2023] and [du2022a]), typically modeled each ID class with a single centroid or prototype in an embedding space. This approach, while a step forward from simpler statistical methods, inherently made an oversimplified assumption about the internal structure of real-world data. \"[lu20249d4] Learning with Mixture of Prototypes for Out-of-Distribution Detection (2024)\" introduces a significant methodological shift by proposing Prototypic AlLearning with a Mixture of prototypes (PALM), which models each ID class with *multiple* prototypes. This allows for a more nuanced and faithful representation of intra-class diversity.\n- *Problem evolution*: The primary limitation addressed by PALM is the \"naive enforcement\" of a single prototype per class in previous solutions. This oversimplification fails to capture the natural variations and sub-clusters present within real-world ID classes. Consequently, such models often struggle to distinguish genuinely OOD samples from diverse ID samples, leading to diminished OOD detection performance. By acknowledging and explicitly modeling intra-class diversity, PALM tackles the problem of inadequate ID data representation head-on.\n- *Key innovations*: The core innovation is the concept of mixture prototype modeling, where each ID class is represented by a set of vMF distributions rather than a single one. This is complemented by an automatic prototype identification and dynamic update mechanism throughout training, ensuring prototypes adapt to the evolving data landscape. Furthermore, the introduction of reciprocal neighbor soft assignment weights allows samples to flexibly associate with a subset of relevant prototypes, providing a more robust and less rigid assignment than prior methods.\n\n*Trend 2: Enhancing Representation Learning for Robust OOD Discrimination*\n- *Methodological progression*: Beyond just defining more prototypes, the effectiveness of OOD detection heavily relies on the quality of the learned embeddings. Previous methods often relied on standard classification losses or simpler distance-based objectives. \"[lu20249d4] Learning with Mixture of Prototypes for Out-of-Distribution Detection (2024)\" advances this by introducing a sophisticated dual-loss optimization strategy. This moves beyond merely encouraging compactness around a single point to actively shaping the embedding space for better discrimination at a finer granularity.\n- *Problem evolution*: The challenge in representation learning for OOD detection is to create an embedding space where ID samples are tightly clustered (even with internal diversity) and distinctly separated from potential OOD regions. Prior approaches often struggled to achieve both fine-grained intra-class compactness and robust inter-class discrimination simultaneously, especially when ID classes themselves were complex. The goal is to learn representations that are not only compact for ID data but also maximally distant from any potential OOD samples.\n- *Key innovations*: PALM's dual loss function is a breakthrough. It combines a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) loss, which encourages sample embeddings to be compact around their *associated* (softly assigned) prototypes, with a novel *prototype contrastive loss*. This contrastive loss is critical: it enhances intra-class compactness at the prototype level (pulling prototypes of the same class closer) while simultaneously boosting inter-class discrimination by pushing prototypes of different classes further apart. This dual optimization leads to more faithful and compact sample embeddings, significantly improving the separation between ID and OOD samples. The paper also demonstrates the extended applicability of its automatic prototype learning mechanism to challenging unsupervised OOD detection settings, broadening the impact of its representation learning strategy.\n\n3. *Synthesis*:\nThe unified intellectual trajectory connecting these works, as exemplified by \"[lu20249d4] Learning with Mixture of Prototypes for Out-of-Distribution Detection (2024)\", is the continuous pursuit of more sophisticated and accurate modeling of in-distribution data to improve the reliability of Out-of-Distribution detection. Their collective contribution is to advance the state-of-the-art by demonstrating that moving beyond simplistic ID data assumptions and employing advanced representation learning techniques, such as mixture prototypes and dual-loss optimization, leads to significantly more robust and effective OOD detection systems.",

Distance-based OOD detection methods have emerged with enhanced deep representation learning. They identify unseen OOD samples by measuring their distances from ID class centroids or prototypes. However, existing approaches learn the representation relying on oversimplified data assumptions, e.g, modeling ID data of each class with one centroid class prototype or using loss functions not designed for OOD detection, which overlook the natural diversities within the data. Naively enforcing data samples of each class to be compact around only one prototype leads to inadequate modeling of realistic data and limited performance. To tackle these issues, we propose PrototypicAl Learning with a Mixture of prototypes (PALM) which models each class with multiple prototypes to capture the sample diversities, and learns more faithful and compact samples embeddings to enhance OOD detection. Our method automatically identifies and dynamically updates prototypes, assigning each sample to a subset of prototypes via reciprocal neighbor soft assignment weights. PALM optimizes a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) loss to encourage the sample embeddings to be compact around the associated prototypes, as well as a contrastive loss on all prototypes to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class discrimination at the prototype level. Moreover, the automatic estimation of prototypes enables our approach to be extended to the challenging OOD detection task with unlabelled ID data.

    "summary": "1. *Chronological Analysis:*\n\nGiven that only one paper is provided, this analysis focuses on how \"[du20248xe] How Does Unlabeled Data Provably Help Out-of-Distribution Detection?

It shifts from methods that often require clean auxiliary OOD data or lack formal justification to a two-stage \"Separate And Learn\" (SAL) approach that can handle noisy, heterogeneous unlabeled data.

Its focus on theoretical guarantees for unlabeled data reflects a growing trend in machine learning towards more explainable and provable methods.\n\n2. *Evolution Analysis:*\n\nThe field of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection has seen a continuous push towards building more robust and reliable machine learning models. A significant challenge has been how to effectively leverage the abundance of unlabeled data available in real-world scenarios, especially when this data is a noisy mixture of in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. The work by \"[du20248xe] How Does Unlabeled Data Provably Help Out-of-Distribution Detection? (2024)\" marks a pivotal moment in this evolution, establishing a new paradigm for provably robust OOD detection.\n\n*Trend 1: Towards Provably Robust and Data-Efficient OOD Detection with Unlabeled Data*\n\n-   *Methodological progression*: Early approaches to OOD detection often relied on training models solely on labeled ID data, using confidence scores or reconstruction errors to identify anomalies. While effective to some extent, these methods struggled with the inherent brittleness of neural networks to novel inputs. A significant methodological shift occurred with the introduction of methods that incorporate auxiliary unlabeled data. Approaches like Outlier Exposure \\cite{hendrycks2019deep} demonstrated the empirical benefits of training with known OOD examples. However, these methods often assumed the availability of a *clean* set of auxiliary OOD data, a strong assumption rarely met in practice. More recent work, such as Katz-Samuels et al. (2022), explored using unlabeled data for regularization, but often lacked formal theoretical guarantees.\n    \"[du20248xe] How Does Unlabeled Data Provably Help Out-of-Distribution Detection? (2024)\" introduces a profound methodological progression with its \"Separate And Learn\" (SAL) framework. This two-stage approach fundamentally changes how unlabeled data is utilized. Instead of simply exposing the model to auxiliary data or using it for regularization without deep understanding, SAL first *separates* candidate outliers from the noisy unlabeled wild data using a novel gradient-based filtering mechanism. This is followed by *learning* a binary OOD classifier. This structured, theoretically grounded approach represents a significant leap from prior, often heuristic, uses of unlabeled data. The use of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on a gradient matrix to derive filtering scores is a particularly innovative technical contribution, allowing for the identification of outliers without explicit OOD labels.\n\n-   *Problem evolution*: The core problem in OOD detection has always been the model's inability to recognize inputs that deviate significantly from its training distribution. As the field progressed, the problem evolved to include the challenge of leveraging readily available *unlabeled* data. Previous solutions faced two critical limitations: first, a lack of formal theoretical understanding of *how* unlabeled data genuinely aids OOD detection, leaving practitioners without rigorous justification. Second, the practical hurdle of needing *clean* auxiliary OOD data, which is often unavailable in real-world \"wild\" datasets that are inherently heterogeneous mixtures of ID and OOD samples. This \"Huber contamination model\" for wild data posed a significant barrier to effectively using unlabeled resources.\n    \"[du20248xe] How Does Unlabeled Data Provably Help Out-of-Distribution Detection? (2024)\" directly addresses these evolving problems. It tackles the theoretical gap by providing rigorous error bounds and generalization guarantees, formally explaining the mechanism by which unlabeled data improves OOD detection. Crucially, it overcomes the clean data assumption by designing a filtering mechanism that can operate on *noisy* unlabeled data, effectively separating potential outliers from the ID samples within the wild dataset. This directly solves the problem of extracting useful OOD information from a heterogeneous mixture without requiring explicit OOD labels.\n\n-   *Key innovations*: The most significant innovation introduced by \"[du20248xe] How Does Unlabeled Data Provably Help Out-of-Distribution Detection? (2024)\" is the provision of *both strong theoretical guarantees and empirical effectiveness* for leveraging unlabeled data in OOD detection. The SAL framework itself, with its two-stage design, is a novel algorithmic contribution. Within SAL, the gradient-based filtering score `τ_i`, derived from SVD of the gradient matrix `G`, is a breakthrough for identifying candidate outliers from noisy mixtures. This allows the model to learn from \"wild\" data without the unrealistic assumption of clean auxiliary OOD samples. The theoretical contributions, specifically Theorems 1, 2, and 3, are groundbreaking. They formally quantify the separability of outliers and the learnability of the OOD classifier, providing the first rigorous justification for how unlabeled data *provably* helps. These innovations collectively enable state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks while simultaneously advancing the fundamental understanding of OOD detection.\n\n3. *Synthesis*\n\n\"[du20248xe] How Does Unlabeled Data Provably Help Out-of-Distribution Detection? (2024)\" represents a unified intellectual trajectory towards grounding empirical successes in OOD detection with robust theoretical understanding. Its collective contribution is the establishment of a novel, provably effective framework that leverages noisy unlabeled data to significantly enhance OOD awareness, thereby improving the safety and reliability of machine learning models in real-world applications.",

This lack of a clean set of OOD samples poses significant challenges in learning an optimal OOD classifier.

It also delivers empirically superior performance.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: This work establishes a formal foundation for understanding the role of unlabeled data in OOD detection. It opens new avenues for developing theoretically grounded OOD methods, especially in realistic scenarios where unlabeled \"wild\" data is noisy and heterogeneous. The framework's ability to improve OOD awareness without clean auxiliary data has direct implications for enhancing the safety and reliability of machine learning models in real-world deployments.",

    "summary": "\n2. *Evolution Analysis:*\n\n**Trend 1: Advancing Vision-Language Models for Open-Vocabulary Out-of-Distribution Detection via Implicit Negative Semantics**\n\n*   *Methodological progression*: The evolution of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, particularly within the realm of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), has seen a significant shift from explicit OOD data reliance to more implicit, semantic-driven approaches. Early VLM-driven OOD methods, such as CLIPN, attempted to address the challenge by training an additional 'no' text encoder using large auxiliary datasets. This approach, while effective to some extent, was computationally expensive and increased network parameters, deviating from the lightweight nature often desired in prompt learning. Another direction, exemplified by LoCoOp, focused on capturing local features from In-Distribution (ID) training data, but this could inadvertently compromise the global perception capabilities of pre-trained VLMs like CLIP and sometimes reduce ID classification accuracy.\n\n    The paper \"Learning Transferable Negative Prompts for Out-of-Distribution Detection\" [li20245b6] marks a pivotal methodological progression. It moves beyond these prior limitations by introducing the novel concept of \"negative prompts.\" Instead of explicitly modeling OOD data or relying on local features, `NegPrompt` [li20245b6] learns a set of negative connotations for each ID class using *only* ID training data. This means OOD samples are detected not by their similarity to known outliers, but by their higher similarity to these learned negative prompts than to standard positive class prompts. This represents a sophisticated leveraging of the VLM's inherent semantic understanding to implicitly define OOD boundaries, a more elegant and efficient solution than its predecessors.\n\n*   *Problem evolution*: The core problems in OOD detection that `NegPrompt` [li20245b6] addresses are multifaceted. Previous prompt learning methods for OOD detection suffered from a high false positive rate, largely because their training lacked exposure to OOD images, leading to misclassifications of OOD data as ID with high confidence. Furthermore, a critical limitation across many existing methods was the assumption that samples for *all* ID classes would be available during training. This rendered them ineffective in open-vocabulary learning scenarios, where novel ID classes might appear at inference time. Zero-shot methods, while not requiring training data, often lacked adaptation to the target dataset, leading to misidentification of unusual ID images as OOD.\n\n    `NegPrompt` [li20245b6] directly tackles these gaps. It resolves the high false positive rate by explicitly learning negative semantics, which helps delineate OOD samples more accurately. Crucially, it addresses the open-vocabulary challenge by designing \"transferable negative prompts.\" This innovation allows the model to detect OOD samples even for ID classes not present during training, a capability largely unexplored or inadequately solved by prior fine-tuning OOD detection methods. By operating solely on ID data, it also circumvents the computational and data-intensive requirements of methods like CLIPN, which needed large auxiliary datasets and additional encoders.\n\n*   *Key innovations*: The breakthrough contributions of `NegPrompt` [li20245b6] are primarily centered around its novel approach to prompt learning. The introduction of \"negative prompts\" is a significant innovation, allowing the model to define what an ID class *is not*, rather than just what it *is*. This enables a more robust and fine-grained OOD detection. Another key innovation is the ability to learn these negative prompts using *only* ID training data, completely eliminating the need for any external outlier data or additional encoders. This makes the method lightweight, data-efficient, and more practical for real-world deployment.\n\n    Perhaps the most impactful innovation is the *transferability* of these negative prompts. This enables `NegPrompt` [li20245b6] to perform open-vocabulary OOD detection, a novel capability for fine-tuning OOD methods. It allows the system to generalize to novel ID classes by simply replacing the class name in the prompts, thereby extending OOD detection to dynamic environments where new ID categories constantly emerge. This collective set of innovations significantly advances the state-of-the-art in VLM-driven OOD detection, offering a more effective, efficient, and adaptable solution.\n\n3. *Synthesis*:\nThis work represents a significant leap in OOD detection by ingeniously leveraging the semantic understanding of Vision-Language Models. It unifies the goals of lightweight, data-efficient training with robust, open-vocabulary OOD detection by introducing the novel concept of transferable negative prompts. Collectively, `NegPrompt` [li20245b6] advances OOD detection by enabling more accurate and adaptable detection of unknown samples without requiring explicit OOD training data, a critical step towards safer and more reliable AI systems.",

To address this issue, we introduce a novel OOD detection method, named ‘NegPrompt’, to learn a set of negative prompts, each representing a negative connotation of a given class label, for delineating the boundaries between ID and OOD images. It learns such negative prompts with ID data only, without any reliance on external out-lier data. Further, current methods assume the availability of samples of all ID classes, rendering them ineffective in open-vocabulary learning scenarios where the inference stage can contain novel ID classes not present during training. In contrast, our learned negative prompts are transferable to novel class labels. Experiments on various ImageNet benchmarks show that NegPrompt surpasses state-of-the-art prompt-learning-based OOD detection methods and maintains a consistent lead in hard OOD detection in closed- and open-vocabulary classification scenarios.

Each negative prompt represents a negative connotation or characteristics contrary to a given ID class label. The method aims to delineate boundaries between ID and OOD images by making OOD samples exhibit higher similarity to these negative prompts than to the positive prompts (standard class embeddings).\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:**\n        *   **ID-only Training:** `NegPrompt` \\cite{li20245b6} learns these negative prompts using *only* ID training data and their corresponding positive prompts (e.g., from CoOp \\cite{li20245b6}), eliminating the need for any external outlier data or additional encoders.\n        *   **Transferable Negative Prompts:** The learned negative prompts are designed to be transferable to novel class labels.

Its superior performance in hard OOD and open-vocabulary settings addresses critical challenges in the field.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:** The concept of learning transferable \"negative prompts\" using only ID data opens new avenues for research in OOD detection, anomaly detection, and robust machine learning, especially in resource-constrained or dynamic environments. It demonstrates a powerful way to leverage the semantic understanding of VLMs for safety-critical applications without requiring explicit OOD examples.",

    "summary": "\n\n2. *Evolution Analysis:*\nThe provided citation path, though currently featuring a single seminal work, marks a critical inflection point in the research landscape of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Detection. This initial paper, [hendrycks17baseline] A Baseline for Detecting Misclassified and Out-of-Distribution Examples in Neural Networks (2017), laid a foundational stone, establishing a powerful yet simple approach that would profoundly influence subsequent methodological developments and problem formulations in the field.\n\n*Trend 1: Establishing Foundational Baselines for Post-Hoc OOD Detection and Uncertainty Quantification*\n- *Methodological progression*: The paper [hendrycks17baseline] A Baseline for Detecting Misclassified and Out-of-Distribution Examples in Neural Networks (2017) introduces a remarkably straightforward yet profoundly effective methodological approach: leveraging the maximum softmax probability (MSP) from a standard, pre-trained neural network as a confidence score. This method is inherently \"post-hoc,\" meaning it does not necessitate any modifications to the model's architecture, training objective, or even re-training specifically for OOD detection. Instead, it ingeniously re-purposes an existing output—the highest probability assigned by the softmax layer to any class—for a new, critical task: assessing whether an input is in-distribution (ID) or out-of-distribution (OOD), or if an ID input has been misclassified. This simplicity was a radical departure from more complex, often computationally intensive, methods that might involve explicit density estimation, generative modeling, or specialized network architectures. The core insight was that a standard classifier, when highly confident (high MSP), is likely seeing an in-distribution example it understands, whereas low MSP often signals novelty or confusion. This established a paradigm where OOD detection could be achieved with minimal overhead, making it highly accessible and deployable across various deep learning applications.\n\n- *Problem evolution*: Prior to the publication of [hendrycks17baseline] in 2017, the burgeoning field of deep learning, while achieving unprecedented success in classification tasks, largely overlooked a critical vulnerability: the overconfidence of neural networks when confronted with inputs far removed from their training distribution. Models would often assign high confidence scores to completely novel, nonsensical, or irrelevant inputs, making them unreliable in real-world, open-set environments. The problem of OOD detection, therefore, lacked a universally accepted, strong, and easy-to-implement baseline against which new methods could be rigorously compared. Researchers often resorted to ad-hoc solutions or complex, domain-specific techniques. [hendrycks17baseline] directly addresses this critical gap by providing a robust, computationally efficient, and widely applicable method to identify both OOD examples and misclassified in-distribution examples. It brought to the forefront the urgent need for deep learning models to express meaningful uncertainty, thereby shifting the research focus towards developing more reliable and trustworthy AI systems. By demonstrating that even a simple metric could effectively flag OOD inputs, the paper underscored the severity of the overconfidence problem and provided a tangible first step towards its mitigation, setting a clear challenge for future research.\n\n- *Key innovations*: The primary innovation of [hendrycks17baseline] is the identification, empirical validation, and popularization of Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) as an effective and surprisingly strong signal for OOD detection. By rigorously demonstrating that lower MSP correlates strongly with OOD inputs or misclassifications across various datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10 vs. SVHN, TinyImageNet), the paper provided a crucial insight: standard neural networks, despite being trained solely for classification, implicitly learn some notion of \"in-distributionness\" that can be extracted and leveraged. This simple yet profound insight established a powerful and competitive baseline, often outperforming more complex methods of its time. This achievement was transformative because it democratized OOD detection, making it accessible to practitioners without requiring specialized training, architectural modifications, or significant computational resources. It provided a clear, strong reference point, enabling subsequent research to focus on developing methods that could demonstrably improve upon this known, effective baseline, rather than starting from scratch. The paper's contribution was not just a new method, but the establishment of a foundational benchmark that catalyzed and structured much of the subsequent research in OOD detection.\n\n3. *Synthesis*\n[hendrycks17baseline] A Baseline for Detecting Misclassified and Out-of-Distribution Examples in Neural Networks (2017) initiated a crucial intellectual trajectory in Out-of-Distribution Detection by establishing a simple yet highly effective baseline using maximum softmax probability. Its collective contribution lies in demonstrating that even standard neural networks can provide valuable signals for detecting novel inputs, thereby setting a foundational benchmark and catalyzing extensive research into more robust and sophisticated OOD detection methods.",

    "seed_title": "MultiOOD: Scaling Out-of-Distribution Detection for Multiple Modalities",
    "summary": "\n2. *Evolution Analysis:*\n\nThe field of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Detection has primarily focused on unimodal data, predominantly images, for many years. However, the increasing deployment of machine learning models in complex, safety-critical real-world scenarios, such as autonomous driving, robotics, and medical imaging, has highlighted a critical gap: these applications are inherently multimodal, relying on diverse sensor streams like video, LiDAR, radar, audio, and optical flow. The paper \"[dong2024a8k] MultiOOD: Scaling Out-of-Distribution Detection for Multiple Modalities (2024)\" represents a pivotal moment, initiating a significant evolutionary trend by shifting the OOD detection paradigm from unimodal to multimodal.\n\n*Trend 1: Transition from Unimodal to Multimodal Out-of-Distribution Detection*\n\n- *Methodological progression*:\n    Prior to [dong2024a8k] MultiOOD (2024), OOD detection methodologies were largely designed for single-modality inputs. Techniques like Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP), Energy-based models, logit normalization, Mahalanobis distance, and various density estimation or reconstruction methods were developed and evaluated almost exclusively on image datasets. While effective in their unimodal contexts, these methods inherently fail to capitalize on the rich, complementary information available across multiple modalities. The methodological progression introduced by [dong2024a8k] MultiOOD (2024) is a direct response to this limitation. It moves beyond simple fusion strategies, which merely concatenate or combine unimodal features, by proposing sophisticated algorithms that explicitly leverage inter-modal interactions. The core of this progression lies in the `Agree-to-Disagree (A2D)` training algorithm, which encourages modalities to align on in-distribution ground-truth predictions while actively diverging on other classes, thereby amplifying a novel signal for OOD. This represents a significant methodological leap from treating modalities as independent streams to actively orchestrating their interactions for OOD detection. Furthermore, the `Nearest Neighbor Prototype-based Mixup (NP-Mix)` technique advances outlier synthesis by generating more diverse and effective OOD samples, moving beyond methods that create outliers too close to the in-distribution data manifold.\n\n- *Problem evolution*:\n    The primary problem addressed by [dong2024a8k] MultiOOD (2024) is the glaring mismatch between the unimodal focus of existing OOD research and the multimodal nature of real-world applications. Previous solutions, while advancing OOD detection for specific data types, left the critical challenge of multimodal OOD largely unexplored and unsolved. The paper explicitly identifies the lack of dedicated multimodal OOD benchmarks as a major impediment, making it impossible to systematically develop and evaluate algorithms tailored for such complex scenarios. It also highlights that existing unimodal methods, when applied to multimodal data (even with simple fusion), do not fully exploit the complementary nature of different sensor streams. The problem evolves from \"how to detect OOD in images\" to \"how to robustly detect OOD in complex, multimodal environments by leveraging inter-modal information.\" This shift is crucial for deploying AI systems safely in open-world settings where unknown inputs are common and often manifest across multiple sensory channels.\n\n- *Key innovations*:\n    [dong2024a8k] MultiOOD (2024) introduces several breakthrough contributions that enable this transition. Firstly, the `MultiOOD Benchmark` is a foundational innovation, providing the first-of-its-kind standardized platform for multimodal OOD detection. Comprising diverse video datasets with combinations of video, optical flow, and audio, it facilitates systematic research into both Near-OOD and Far-OOD scenarios. Secondly, the identification and empirical validation of the `Modality Prediction Discrepancy (MPD)` phenomenon is a key theoretical insight. This observation—that OOD data exhibits significantly higher prediction variability across modalities than in-distribution data—provides a novel, modality-specific signal for OOD detection. Building upon MPD, the `Agree-to-Disagree (A2D)` algorithm is a novel training paradigm that explicitly amplifies this discrepancy, making it a powerful OOD indicator. Finally, `Nearest Neighbor Prototype-based Mixup (NP-Mix)` innovates outlier synthesis by generating more effective OOD samples that explore broader feature spaces, enhancing the robustness of OOD detectors. These innovations collectively establish a robust framework for multimodal OOD detection, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art.\n\n3. *Synthesis*\nThis work initiates a crucial intellectual trajectory in Out-of-Distribution Detection, moving the field from its unimodal roots towards addressing the inherent multimodal complexity of real-world AI applications.

        "title": "MultiOOD: Scaling Out-of-Distribution Detection for Multiple Modalities",
        "abstract": "Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is important for deploying machine learning models in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and robot-assisted surgery. Existing research has mainly focused on unimodal scenarios on image data. However, real-world applications are inherently multimodal, which makes it essential to leverage information from multiple modalities to enhance the efficacy of OOD detection. To establish a foundation for more realistic Multimodal OOD Detection, we introduce the first-of-its-kind benchmark, MultiOOD, characterized by diverse dataset sizes and varying modality combinations. We first evaluate existing unimodal OOD detection algorithms on MultiOOD, observing that the mere inclusion of additional modalities yields substantial improvements. This underscores the importance of utilizing multiple modalities for OOD detection. Based on the observation of Modality Prediction Discrepancy between in-distribution (ID) and OOD data, and its strong correlation with OOD performance, we propose the Agree-to-Disagree (A2D) algorithm to encourage such discrepancy during training. Moreover, we introduce a novel outlier synthesis method, NP-Mix, which explores broader feature spaces by leveraging the information from nearest neighbor classes and complements A2D to strengthen OOD detection performance. Extensive experiments on MultiOOD demonstrate that training with A2D and NP-Mix improves existing OOD detection algorithms by a large margin. Our source code and MultiOOD benchmark are available at https://github.com/donghao51/MultiOOD.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **1. Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Existing Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection research predominantly focuses on unimodal scenarios, primarily image data. However, real-world safety-critical applications (e.g., autonomous driving, robot-assisted surgery) are inherently multimodal, and current methods fail to effectively leverage complementary information from multiple modalities to enhance OOD detection efficacy \\cite{dong2024a8k}.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: OOD detection is crucial for deploying machine learning models robustly and safely in open-world scenarios. The lack of dedicated multimodal OOD benchmarks and algorithms tailored to exploit inter-modal interactions makes it challenging to develop effective solutions for realistic applications \\cite{dong2024a8k}.\n\n*   **2. Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Previous OOD detection algorithms include classification-based methods (e.g., MSP, Energy, logit normalization, outlier synthesis) and distance-based methods (e.g., Mahalanobis), as well as density estimation and reconstruction techniques \\cite{dong2024a8k}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: These methods are primarily designed for unimodal settings. While some recent works explore vision-language models, their evaluations are still limited to image-only benchmarks, thus not fully leveraging diverse modalities like LiDAR, camera, video, audio, and optical flow. Simple fusion of modalities shows improvement, but dedicated algorithms are needed to account for their interaction and complementary nature \\cite{dong2024a8k}.\n\n*   **3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**:\n        *   **MultiOOD Benchmark**: Introduction of the first-of-its-kind benchmark for Multimodal OOD Detection, comprising five video datasets with diverse sizes (3k to 57k clips) and varying modality combinations (video, optical flow, audio) \\cite{dong2024a8k}. It includes both Near-OOD (semantic shifts within the same domain) and Far-OOD (semantic and domain shifts) setups.\n        *   **Modality Prediction Discrepancy (MPD)**: Identification and illustration of a phenomenon where softmax predictions across different modalities show negligible discrepancies for in-distribution (ID) data but significant variability for OOD data. This discrepancy is strongly correlated with OOD detection performance \\cite{dong2024a8k}.\n        *   **Agree-to-Disagree (A2D) Algorithm**: A novel training algorithm motivated by MPD. A2D encourages different modalities to \"Agree\" on the prediction of the ground-truth class while simultaneously \"Disagreeing\" on other classes by maximizing the distance (e.g., Hellinger distance) between their predictions \\cite{dong2024a8k}.\n        *   **Nearest Neighbor Prototype-based Mixup (NP-Mix)**: A novel outlier synthesis method that complements A2D. It generates outliers by leveraging information from nearest neighbor classes, exploring broader feature spaces compared to existing outlier synthesis techniques which typically generate outliers near ID data \\cite{dong2024a8k}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**: The paper introduces the first dedicated benchmark for multimodal OOD detection. The A2D algorithm is novel in its approach to explicitly amplify inter-modal prediction discrepancies for OOD data during training. NP-Mix innovates outlier synthesis by exploring wider feature spaces through nearest neighbor prototypes \\cite{dong2024a8k}.\n\n*   **4. Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Benchmark**: `MultiOOD`, the first benchmark for Multimodal OOD Detection, featuring diverse datasets and modality combinations (video, optical flow, audio) for both Near-OOD and Far-OOD scenarios \\cite{dong2024a8k}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insight**: Identification and empirical validation of the `Modality Prediction Discrepancy` phenomenon and its strong correlation with OOD detection performance \\cite{dong2024a8k}.\n    *   **Novel Algorithm**: `Agree-to-Disagree (A2D)` training algorithm, designed to enhance multimodal prediction discrepancies for OOD data by encouraging agreement on ground-truth and disagreement on other classes \\cite{dong2024a8k}.\n    *   **Novel Technique**: `Nearest Neighbor Prototype-based Mixup (NP-Mix)`, an outlier synthesis method that generates outliers in broader feature spaces by utilizing nearest neighbor class prototypes \\cite{dong2024a8k}.\n\n*   **5. Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Comprehensive evaluations of existing unimodal OOD algorithms on the `MultiOOD` benchmark, followed by extensive experiments demonstrating the superiority of `A2D` and `NP-Mix` \\cite{dong2024a8k}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**: FPR95 (False Positive Rate at 95% True Positive Rate, lower is better), AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, higher is better), and ID ACC (In-Distribution Accuracy) \\cite{dong2024a8k}.\n    *   **Comparison Results**:\n        *   Even simple fusion of modalities (e.g., video and optical flow) substantially improves OOD detection performance over unimodal baselines, highlighting the importance of multimodal information \\cite{dong2024a8k}.\n        *   Training with `A2D` and `NP-Mix` yields considerable performance enhancements over existing unimodal OOD detection algorithms. For instance, on the UCF101 dataset, the approach reduced FPR95 for the ASH method from 32.14% to 10.68%, an absolute improvement of 21.46% \\cite{dong2024a8k}.\n        *   `A2D` training successfully amplifies the Modality Prediction Discrepancy, which is shown to be highly correlated with improved OOD performance \\cite{dong2024a8k}.\n\n*   **6. Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**: The paper primarily focuses on the benefits of the proposed methods. While it highlights the limitations of existing unimodal methods in multimodal settings, it does not explicitly detail specific technical limitations or assumptions of `A2D` or `NP-Mix` beyond their design choices.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The `MultiOOD` benchmark and experiments are focused on action recognition tasks using video, optical flow, and audio modalities. While the principles of `A2D` and `NP-Mix` could be generalized, their direct applicability and performance on other multimodal tasks (e.g., autonomous driving with LiDAR, radar, camera) or different modality types would require further investigation \\cite{dong2024a8k}.\n\n*   **7. Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: `MultiOOD` establishes a crucial foundation for future research in Multimodal OOD Detection, shifting the research paradigm from unimodal to more realistic multimodal scenarios. The `A2D` and `NP-Mix` algorithms significantly advance the technical state-of-the-art by providing effective strategies to leverage multimodal information for robust OOD detection \\cite{dong2024a8k}.\n    *   **Potential Impact**: This work has the potential to significantly impact the deployment of machine learning models in safety-critical applications by enabling more reliable detection of unknown inputs when multiple sensor streams are available. The public release of the `MultiOOD` benchmark and source code will facilitate and accelerate future research in this vital area \\cite{dong2024a8k}.",
