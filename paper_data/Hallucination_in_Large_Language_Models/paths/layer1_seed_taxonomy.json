    "seed_title": "On Faithfulness and Factuality in Abstractive Summarization",
    "summary": "**1. Integration Analysis:**\n\nThe integration of these 20 new papers significantly extends, refines, and in some areas, redirects the previously understood evolutionary trajectory of research into \"Hallucination in Large Language Models.\"\n\n*   **Relationship to Previously Identified Trends:**\n    *   **Trend 1 (From Task-Specific Characterization to General LLM-Centric Understanding and Evaluation):** This trend is profoundly extended. The concept of cross-modal hallucination, initially introduced for vision-language models ([dai20229aa] 2022), now explicitly encompasses **video** ([wang2024rta] 2024) and **audio** ([kuan20249pm] 2024) modalities, complete with dedicated taxonomies and benchmarks. The meta-analysis efforts ([zhang2023k1j] 2023, [ye2023yom] 2023) are broadened to comprehensive, **multimodal surveys** covering all foundation models ([sahoo2024hcb] 2024, [liu2024sn3] 2024, [lan20240yz] 2024, [li2025qzg] 2025). Evaluation methodologies are pushed further towards **fine-grained, automatically verifiable, and process-oriented assessment**, including rationale verification ([oh2024xa3] 2024, [li2024osp] 2024) and complex algorithmic reasoning on real-world graphs ([tang2024a1j] 2024). A critical new focus is **dialogue-level hallucination** ([chen2024c4k] 2024). The understanding of hallucination's *causes* is deepened with the identification of \"knowledge overshadowing\" ([zhang2024qq9] 2024) and the development of a **unified theoretical framework** exploring mathematical origins and inevitability ([li2025qzg] 2025).\n    *   **Trend 2 (From Post-Hoc Correction to Proactive Prevention and Dynamic Knowledge Integration):** This trend is also substantially refined and made more efficient and robust. The focus shifts towards **real-time, targeted, and internal-state-driven mitigation**. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is made more intelligent by leveraging LLM internal uncertainty for selective retrieval ([niu2024v97] 2024, [su2024gnz] 2024) and by dynamically highlighting relevant context in long documents ([lv2024k5x] 2024). Proactive prevention through **abstention** is made label-free and semantically aware ([tjandra2024umq] 2024). A new critical dimension is the introduction of **\"semantic guardrails\"** for absolute error prevention in safety-critical domains ([hakim2024d4u] 2024). For LVLMs, training-free, inference-time visual grounding ([zhao2024ge8] 2024) and novel \"hallucination-induced optimization\" ([chen20247jb] 2024) represent advanced mitigation. The field is also moving towards **end-to-end adaptive systems** that integrate evaluation and mitigation ([liang2024hoo] 2024).\n\n*   **New Methodological or Conceptual Shifts:**\n    *   **Internal State-based Detection and Mitigation:** A significant new paradigm is the use of LLM's *internal states* (logits, entropy, contextualized embeddings, layer divergence) for real-time, unsupervised hallucination detection ([su2024lem] 2024) and for guiding targeted knowledge retrieval ([niu2024v97] 2024, [su2024gnz] 2024). This moves beyond external checks to intrinsic model signals.\n    *   **Formal Theoretical Grounding:** The introduction of a unified theoretical framework and mathematical analysis of hallucination origins ([li2025qzg] 2025) marks a shift towards a deeper, more fundamental understanding beyond empirical observation.\n    *   **Process-Oriented Evaluation:** Benchmarks now explicitly evaluate the *reasoning process* and *solution paths* (e.g., in graph computation, [tang2024a1j] 2024) and verify rationales ([oh2024xa3] 2024, [li2024osp] 2024), rather than just final answers.\n    *   **Safety-Critical \"Never Event\" Prevention:** The concept of \"semantic guardrails\" ([hakim2024d4u] 2024) introduces a new level of rigor for LLM deployment in high-stakes environments, aiming for absolute error prevention.\n    *   **Automated, Scalable Fine-grained Annotation:** The iterative self-training framework for ANAH-v2 ([gu202414e] 2024) addresses the data bottleneck for deep, sentence-level analysis, enabling the creation of large, high-quality datasets without continuous human labor.\n    *   **Adversarial Training for Mitigation:** The \"Hallucination-Induced Optimization\" with an \"Evil LVLM\" ([chen20247jb] 2024) introduces a novel, almost counter-intuitive, adversarial approach to strengthen contrastive decoding.\n\n*   **Gaps Filled or New Directions Opened:**\n    *   **Gaps Filled:** The new papers fill critical gaps in multimodal evaluation (video, audio), multi-object LVLM hallucination, dialogue-level assessment, and the scalability of fine-grained annotation. They also address the inefficiency of generic RAG and the lack of label-free abstention.\n    *   **New Directions Opened:** Research into leveraging LLM internal states is a significant new direction. The formal theoretical analysis of hallucination, the development of \"semantic guardrails,\" and the use of metamorphic testing for reasoning validation are also novel avenues. The identification of \"knowledge overshadowing\" provides a new specific cause to target.\n\n*   **Connections between New Papers and Earlier Works:** Many new papers build directly on the foundations laid by earlier works. For example, the multimodal surveys ([sahoo2024hcb] 2024, [liu2024sn3] 2024, [lan20240yz] 2024) consolidate the cross-modal concept from [dai20229aa] (2022) and earlier LLM surveys ([zhang2023k1j] 2023, [ye2023yom] 2023). The refined RAG approaches ([niu2024v97] 2024, [lv2024k5x] 2024, [su2024gnz] 2024) enhance the dynamic knowledge integration ideas from [li2022ypy] (2022) and [vu202337s] (2023). Proactive abstention ([tjandra2024umq] 2024) refines the \"know what you don't know\" concept from [luo2023xyc] (2023). The end-to-end framework ([liang2024hoo] 2024) integrates techniques like Chain-of-Verification ([dhuliawala2023rqn] 2023).\n\n*   **Changes to Overall Narrative:** The overall narrative shifts from primarily *characterizing and mitigating* hallucinations to a more holistic approach that emphasizes *deep mechanistic understanding*, *proactive and intrinsic prevention*, and the development of *highly robust, adaptive, and safety-aware AI systems*. The focus is no longer just on reducing errors, but on building LLMs that are transparent about their uncertainty, verifiable in their reasoning, and fundamentally trustworthy across an expanding array of complex tasks and modalities.\n\n**Temporal Positioning:**\nAll new papers are from 2024 or 2025, representing the latest developments in the field. They extend the chronological progression, building directly on the 2023 papers and earlier foundational works.\n\n---\n\n**2. Updated Evolution Analysis:**\n\nThe evolution of research into \"Hallucination in Large Language Models\" has accelerated and diversified, deepening the understanding from initial task-specific characterization to a sophisticated, multimodal, and LLM-native approach. This trajectory is marked by two major, intertwined trends: the progression from task-specific characterization to general LLM-centric understanding and evaluation, and the shift from post-hoc correction to proactive prevention and dynamic knowledge integration, now heavily influenced by internal model states and safety-critical considerations.\n\n**Trend 1: From Task-Specific Characterization to General LLM-Centric Understanding and Evaluation**\n\n*   *Methodological progression*: The foundational phase began with human evaluation and empirical analysis in specific NLG tasks like summarization ([maynez2020h3q] 2020), leading to reference-free, token-level detection for free-form text ([liu2021mo6] 2021). This expanded to comprehensive meta-analyses and taxonomies for LLMs ([zhang2023k1j] 2023, [ye2023yom] 2023). The latest advancements significantly broaden this scope to **multimodal foundation models**, with dedicated benchmarks for **video-language models** ([wang2024rta] 2024) and **audio-language models** ([kuan20249pm] 2024), building on earlier cross-modal work ([dai20229aa] 2022). Comprehensive surveys now consolidate understanding across *all* modalities ([sahoo2024hcb] 2024, [liu2024sn3] 2024, [lan20240yz] 2024, [li2025qzg] 2025). A critical methodological shift is towards **automated, scalable, and fine-grained evaluation** that probes deeper into LLM reasoning. This includes benchmarks using visual prompts for multi-object hallucination in LVLMs ([chen2024vy7] 2024, [kaul2024ta7] 2024), leveraging relational databases for complex, automatically verifiable questions and *rationales* in LLMs ([oh2024xa3] 2024, [li2024osp] 2024), and probing algorithmic reasoning on real-world graphs, including NP-complete problems ([tang2024a1j] 2024). The development of **dialogue-level benchmarks** ([chen2024c4k] 2024) addresses a new, complex interaction paradigm. Crucially, the field is now enabling **scalable, fine-grained annotation** itself through iterative self-training frameworks ([gu202414e] 2024), addressing a previous bottleneck. A major leap is the advent of **unsupervised, real-time hallucination detection based on LLM internal states** ([su2024lem] 2024), shifting from post-processing to intrinsic, on-the-fly analysis.\n\n*   *Problem evolution*: The problem initially focused on unfaithful content in summarization, broadening to fine-grained detection in free-form text and cross-modal contexts. The new papers highlight the need to address **multi-object hallucination** in LVLMs ([chen2024vy7] 2024, [kaul2024ta7] 2024), **object hallucination in audio** ([kuan20249pm] 2024), and **hallucination in complex reasoning tasks** like graph computation ([tang2024a1j] 2024). A significant problem identified is the **lack of robust evaluation for LLM rationales** and the inability to automatically verify complex reasoning paths ([oh2024xa3] 2024, [li2024osp] 2024). The challenge of **scaling fine-grained annotation** for deeper mechanistic understanding is also explicitly addressed ([gu202414e] 2024). Furthermore, the field is grappling with the **inherent causes of hallucination**, such as \"knowledge overshadowing\" from data imbalance ([zhang2024qq9] 2024), and seeking a **unified theoretical understanding** of its mathematical origins and inevitability ([li2025qzg] 2025). The critical need for **dialogue-level evaluation** for conversational LLMs is also recognized ([chen2024c4k] 2024).\n\n*   *Key innovations*: Beyond earlier taxonomies and benchmarks, new innovations include **VideoHallucer** ([wang2024rta] 2024) and **ECHO/Cover metrics** for audio ([kuan20249pm] 2024), **ROPE** ([chen2024vy7] 2024) and **THRONE** ([kaul2024ta7] 2024) for multi-object/free-form LVLM evaluation, **ERBench** ([oh2024xa3] 2024) and **Drowzee** ([li2024osp] 2024) for rationale-verifiable and metamorphic testing, **GraphArena** ([tang2024a1j] 2024) for complex graph reasoning, **ANAH-v2** ([gu202414e] 2024) for scalable fine-grained annotation, and **MIND** ([su2024lem] 2024) for unsupervised, real-time internal-state detection. **HaluEval 2.0** ([li2024qrj] 2024) provides a new multi-domain benchmark, and **DiaHalu** ([chen2024c4k] 2024) pioneers dialogue-level evaluation. The identification of \"knowledge overshadowing\" ([zhang2024qq9] 2024) and the **unified theoretical framework** ([li2025qzg] 2025) represent conceptual breakthroughs.\n\n*   *Integration points*: These works build directly on the foundational understanding of hallucination in NLG ([maynez2020h3q] 2020) and its expansion to free-form text ([liu2021mo6] 2021) and cross-modal domains ([dai20229aa] 2022). The comprehensive surveys ([liu2024sn3] 2024, [sahoo2024hcb] 2024, [lan20240yz] 2024, [li2025qzg] 2025) consolidate the fragmented knowledge from earlier LLM-centric taxonomies ([zhang2023k1j] 2023, [ye2023yom] 2023), while new benchmarks refine and extend the evaluation paradigms established by [liang20236sh] (2023).\n\n**Trend 2: From Post-Hoc Correction to Proactive Prevention and Dynamic Knowledge Integration**\n\n*   *Methodological progression*: Early mitigation efforts involved post-hoc refinement using external knowledge ([dziri2021bw9] 2021) or training-time interventions ([goyal2021onb] 2021). This progressed to data-centric approaches ([adams202289x] 2022) and decoding-time semantic steering ([sridhar2022l1c] 2022). With the rise of LLMs, the focus shifted to leveraging LLMs themselves as noisy knowledge sources ([li2022ypy] 2022) and sophisticated self-correction mechanisms ([dhuliawala2023rqn] 2023). The new papers mark a significant shift towards **highly efficient, targeted, and real-time knowledge integration and proactive prevention**. This includes **self-refinement-enhanced RAG** that uses LLM internal uncertainty to selectively retrieve knowledge ([niu2024v97] 2024, [su2024gnz] 2024), and **coarse-to-fine highlighting** to make retrieved contexts more relevant and less noisy ([lv2024k5x] 2024). **Proactive abstention** is refined to be label-free and semantically aware, applicable to long-form text ([tjandra2024umq] 2024). For safety-critical applications, the concept of **\"semantic guardrails\"** is introduced to prevent \"never event\" errors and communicate uncertainty ([hakim2024d4u] 2024). In LVLMs, **training-free, inference-time image-grounded guidance** ([zhao2024ge8] 2024) and **hallucination-induced optimization** using an \"Evil LVLM\" for contrastive decoding ([chen20247jb] 2024) represent novel, intrinsic mitigation strategies. The field is also moving towards **end-to-end adaptive frameworks** that integrate automated testset generation, multifaceted benchmarking, and flexible mitigation strategies ([liang2024hoo] 2024).\n\n*   *Problem evolution*: Initially, the problem was correcting hallucinations in generated text, often by comparing to a source or static KG. A key challenge was noisy training data and the lack of understanding of how hallucinations are learned. As LLMs became more powerful, the problem evolved to managing their inherent noise when used as knowledge sources and preventing them from repeating their own errors. The ultimate challenge became preventing hallucinations *before* they occur and addressing the temporal knowledge gap. The new papers address the **inefficiency of indiscriminate RAG** ([niu2024v97] 2024, [su2024gnz] 2024), the challenge of **long, noisy contexts** in RALMs ([lv2024k5x] 2024), and the need for **label-free abstention** in long-form generation ([tjandra2024umq] 2024). A critical new problem is ensuring **absolute safety and preventing \"never event\" errors** in high-stakes domains ([hakim2024d4u] 2024). For LVLMs, the challenge of **uncontrollable global visual uncertainty** in contrastive decoding is tackled ([chen20247jb] 2024). The broader issue of **LLM-generated misinformation** (beyond just factual hallucination) is also being addressed with comprehensive prevention and detection strategies ([liu2024gxh] 2024).\n\n*   *Key innovations*: Key innovations include **Re-KGR** ([niu2024v97] 2024) and **DRAD** ([su2024gnz] 2024) for efficient, hallucination-aware RAG; **COFT** ([lv2024k5x] 2024) for intelligent context highlighting; **semantic entropy** and **AED metric** for label-free abstention ([tjandra2024umq] 2024); **semantic guardrails** (DL-UQ, MISMATCH) for safety-critical applications ([hakim2024d4u] 2024); **MARINE** ([zhao2024ge8] 2024) for training-free LVLM mitigation; and **HIO** with its **Contrary Bradley-Terry Model** ([chen20247jb] 2024) for adversarial contrastive decoding. **THaMES** ([liang2024hoo] 2024) represents an end-to-end adaptive solution. The inference-time mitigation for \"knowledge overshadowing\" ([zhang2024qq9] 2024) also contributes here.\n\n*   *Integration points*: These methods build on earlier mitigation techniques like KG-grounded correction ([dziri2021bw9] 2021, [dong20223yz] 2022), data-centric approaches ([adams202289x] 2022), decoding-time steering ([sridhar2022l1c] 2022), and LLM self-correction ([dhuliawala2023rqn] 2023). The dynamic knowledge integration strategies (RAG, search engine augmentation) from [li2022ypy] (2022) and [vu202337s] (2023) are significantly refined for efficiency and precision. The comprehensive surveys ([tonmoy20244e4] 2024, [liu2024gxh] 2024) consolidate the diverse mitigation landscape.\n\n---\n\n**3. Refined Synthesis**\n\nThe intellectual trajectory has evolved from initially defining and characterizing hallucination in specific NLG tasks to a sophisticated, multimodal, and LLM-native approach that emphasizes deep mechanistic understanding, proactive prevention, and real-time, adaptive mitigation. The field now focuses on leveraging LLM internal states for intrinsic detection, formalizing the mathematical inevitability of some hallucinations, and building robust systems with \"semantic guardrails\" for safety-critical applications. This expanded view collectively contributes to developing more reliable, trustworthy, and contextually grounded large language models across diverse modalities and complex reasoning tasks, moving towards an era of more accountable AI.",

        "title": "On Faithfulness and Factuality in Abstractive Summarization",
        "abstract": "It is well known that the standard likelihood training and approximate decoding objectives in neural text generation models lead to less human-like responses for open-ended tasks such as language modeling and story generation. In this paper we have analyzed limitations of these models for abstractive document summarization and found that these models are highly prone to hallucinate content that is unfaithful to the input document. We conducted a large scale human evaluation of several neural abstractive summarization systems to better understand the types of hallucinations they produce. Our human annotators found substantial amounts of hallucinated content in all model generated summaries. However, our analysis does show that pretrained models are better summarizers not only in terms of raw metrics, i.e., ROUGE, but also in generating faithful and factual summaries as evaluated by humans. Furthermore, we show that textual entailment measures better correlate with faithfulness than standard metrics, potentially leading the way to automatic evaluation metrics as well as training and decoding criteria.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review, emphasizing technical innovations and empirical validation:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Neural abstractive summarization models are highly prone to \"hallucinate\" content that is unfaithful (not supported by the source document) or unfactual. This issue stems from standard likelihood training and approximate decoding objectives.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge**: While current models achieve high fluency and coherence, faithfulness and factuality are critical for summarization. Hallucinations undermine the reliability and trustworthiness of generated summaries, making the problem challenging to address given the inherent abstractive nature of the task.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: The paper acknowledges the advancements in sequence-to-sequence, Transformer, and pretrained language models that have improved fluency. It contrasts summarization with open-ended generation tasks (like story generation) where some \"hallucination\" (novel content) might be desirable.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Existing summarization models, despite their architectural sophistication (RNN, CNN, Transformer), frequently produce unfaithful content. Standard automatic metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore, while useful for fluency and content overlap, correlate poorly with human judgments of faithfulness and factuality.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper's core approach is a large-scale human evaluation to systematically analyze and characterize the types and prevalence of hallucinations in abstractive summaries generated by various state-of-the-art models.\n    *   **Novelty**:\n        *   Introduces a novel categorization of hallucinations:\n            *   **Intrinsic hallucinations**: Misrepresenting information *present* in the input document.\n            *   **Extrinsic hallucinations**: Adding information *not directly inferable* from the input document.\n            *   **Factual hallucinations**: A subset of extrinsic hallucinations that, despite not being in the document, are factually correct (e.g., adding a correct year). The paper argues for tolerance of factual hallucinations if they improve summary quality.\n        *   Explores the use of textual entailment measures as a more semantically-aware automatic evaluation metric for faithfulness, demonstrating its superior correlation with human judgments compared to traditional metrics.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms, Methods, or Techniques**:\n        *   A robust human annotation scheme and methodology for identifying and classifying intrinsic, extrinsic, and factual hallucinations in abstractive summaries \\cite{maynez2020h3q}.\n        *   Empirical demonstration that textual entailment measures offer a more reliable automatic proxy for human judgments of faithfulness than ROUGE or BERTScore \\cite{maynez2020h3q}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights or Analysis**:\n        *   Quantifies the high prevalence of hallucinations (over 70% of summaries) and their breakdown (majority extrinsic, and over 90% of extrinsic being erroneous) across diverse models \\cite{maynez2020h3q}.\n        *   Provides evidence that pretrained models, while still hallucinating, produce more faithful and factual summaries, and are better at integrating background knowledge to generate *factual* extrinsic hallucinations \\cite{maynez2020h3q}.\n        *   Challenges the sole reliance on surface-level metrics for evaluating summarization quality, advocating for deeper semantic understanding.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**:\n        *   A large-scale human evaluation was performed on 500 randomly sampled articles from the XSUM dataset. Human annotators were trained to identify and categorize intrinsic, extrinsic, and factual hallucinations in summaries.\n        *   Summaries from five state-of-the-art abstractive models were evaluated: PTGEN (RNN-based), TCONVS2S (CNN-based), TRANS2S (Transformer), GPT-TUNED (pretrained GPT), and BERTS2S (pretrained BERT-based seq2seq), alongside human-written reference summaries \\cite{maynez2020h3q}.\n        *   The human judgments were correlated with various automatic metrics, including ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, BERTScore, and textual entailment measures.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   Human evaluation revealed that over 70% of single-sentence summaries contained hallucinations. The majority were extrinsic, and over 90% of these extrinsic hallucinations were erroneous (not factual) \\cite{maynez2020h3q}.\n        *   Pretrained models (BERTS2S and GPT-TUNED) consistently performed best in terms of human judgments for faithfulness and factuality, and also showed the highest percentage of *factual* extrinsic hallucinations \\cite{maynez2020h3q}.\n        *   BERTS2S achieved the highest ROUGE and BERTScore scores among the models.\n        *   Crucially, textual entailment measures demonstrated a stronger correlation with human judgments of faithfulness and factuality compared to ROUGE and BERTScore \\cite{maynez2020h3q}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The study primarily focuses on extreme summarization (single-sentence summaries) using the XSUM dataset. While the authors argue the problem is likely worse for longer summaries, direct generalization requires further validation. The human evaluation, while extensive, is limited by its sample size (500 articles) and cost. The paper identifies and characterizes the problem but does not propose a new model or training objective to *solve* hallucination.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The findings are directly applicable to abstractive summarization, particularly in settings where faithfulness to the source document is paramount. The insights into evaluation metrics could extend to other conditional text generation tasks requiring factual consistency.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advance State-of-the-Art**: This paper provides the first large-scale, systematic human evaluation and categorization of hallucinations in abstractive summarization, establishing a critical baseline for understanding this pervasive problem \\cite{maynez2020h3q}. It empirically demonstrates the superior performance of pretrained models in generating more faithful and factual summaries.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: The work highlights the inadequacy of traditional automatic metrics for evaluating faithfulness and strongly advocates for the adoption of semantically-aware metrics like textual entailment. This will likely drive future research into developing novel training objectives, decoding strategies, and evaluation protocols that explicitly address and mitigate hallucinations in abstractive summarization and other conditional text generation tasks.",

        "title": "Learning to Revise References for Faithful Summarization",
        "abstract": "In real-world scenarios with naturally occurring datasets, reference summaries are noisy and may contain information that cannot be inferred from the source text. On large news corpora, removing low quality samples has been shown to reduce model hallucinations. Yet, for smaller, and/or noisier corpora, filtering is detrimental to performance. To improve reference quality while retaining all data, we propose a new approach: to selectively re-write unsupported reference sentences to better reflect source data. We automatically generate a synthetic dataset of positive and negative revisions by corrupting supported sentences and learn to revise reference sentences with contrastive learning. The intensity of revisions is treated as a controllable attribute so that, at inference, diverse candidates can be over-generated-then-rescored to balance faithfulness and abstraction. To test our methods, we extract noisy references from publicly available MIMIC-III discharge summaries for the task of hospital-course summarization, and vary the data on which models are trained. According to metrics and human evaluation, models trained on revised clinical references are much more faithful, informative, and fluent than models trained on original or filtered data.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **CITATION**: \\cite{adams202289x}\n\n---\n\n### Technical Paper Analysis: Learning to Revise References for Faithful Summarization\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Abstractive summarization models frequently produce unfaithful summaries (hallucinations), a problem exacerbated by noisy, naturally occurring reference summaries in training datasets \\cite{adams202289x}. These datasets often lack \"inherent quality guarantees\" \\cite{adams202289x}.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: Noisy training data is detrimental to developing faithful summarization models \\cite{adams202289x}. While filtering low-quality samples works for large, clean corpora, it significantly degrades performance on smaller, noisier datasets (e.g., clinical notes) by discarding valuable data \\cite{adams202289x}. The paper highlights clinical summarization from MIMIC-III, where 60% of reference summary entities are unsupported by the source, demonstrating the severity of the noise problem \\cite{adams202289x}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Previous efforts to improve faithfulness have focused on smarter models, better metrics, content-plan editing, and post-hoc interventions (ranking, editing) \\cite{adams202289x}. For training data noise, the common approach is *filtering* low-quality samples based on entailment or entity overlap \\cite{adams202289x}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Filtering methods, while sometimes improving faithfulness, often degrade informativeness and are \"insufficient to train a competitive model\" when high-quality data is limited \\cite{adams202289x}. They discard data rather than improving it. Synthetic error generation is used but can produce disfluent text or require extensive annotations \\cite{adams202289x}. For clinical summarization, faithfulness in abstractive models is less explored, with most work focusing on extractive methods or finer temporal granularities \\cite{adams202289x}. This work positions itself by proposing to *revise* noisy references rather than remove them, thereby leveraging all available data.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes \"reference revision\" as a data pre-processing step. This involves selectively rewriting unsupported reference sentences to align better with the source text \\cite{adams202289x}.\n        *   **Alignment and Classification**: Each reference sentence is aligned to a small subset (1-5) of source sentences using BERTScore precision and entity coverage. Sentences are then classified as \"supported\" (no unsupported entities, high BERTScore) or \"unsupported\" \\cite{adams202289x}.\n        *   **Synthetic Data Generation (ReDRESS)**: To train a revision model without a gold standard, a novel method called ReDRESS (Reference Distractor Entity Set Swapping) is introduced. ReDRESS takes supported reference sentences and corrupts them to create diverse, realistic \"unsupported\" alternatives. This is achieved by combining BART's span deletion with controlled entity swaps using topically related entities \\cite{adams202289x}. The intensity of corruption (`k` entity swaps) is a controllable attribute \\cite{adams202289x}.\n        *   **Contrastive Learning**: The mix of real (supported) and synthetically generated (unsupported) sentences forms positive and negative revision examples, which are then used to train a revision model via contrastive learning \\cite{adams202289x}. The model learns to transform unsupported sentences into supported ones.\n        *   **Inference**: During inference, diverse revision candidates can be over-generated and then re-scored to balance faithfulness and abstraction \\cite{adams202289x}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**: The approach is novel in its focus on *revising* noisy references rather than simply filtering them, especially for low-resource, noisy domains \\cite{adams202289x}. The automatic generation of diverse, realistic synthetic hallucinations via controlled entity swaps (ReDRESS) for contrastive learning is a key innovation, allowing training without human-annotated revisions \\cite{adams202289x}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Method**: Introduction of \"reference revision\" as a model-agnostic data pre-processing step to improve reference quality for faithful summarization \\cite{adams202289x}.\n    *   **Algorithm for Synthetic Data**: ReDRESS (Reference Distractor Entity Set Swapping), a BART-based denoising autoencoder that generates diverse and realistic synthetic hallucinations by combining span deletion with controlled entity swaps, enabling training without direct supervision for revision \\cite{adams202289x}.\n    *   **Learning Objective**: Application of contrastive learning to train the revision model using the synthetically generated positive and negative revision examples \\cite{adams202289x}.\n    *   **System Design**: A two-stage pipeline involving robust source-reference alignment and classification, followed by a revision model trained on synthetic data \\cite{adams202289x}.\n    *   **Versatility**: Demonstrates that reference revision can also function as a post-hoc editor and a pre-training objective for faithfulness, extending its utility beyond data pre-processing \\cite{adams202289x}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: The methods were tested on the task of hospital-course summarization using the publicly available MIMIC-III dataset \\cite{adams202289x}. Summarization models were trained on three different data preparations: original noisy references, filtered references (using existing methods), and references revised by the proposed method \\cite{adams202289x}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**: Performance was evaluated using both automatic metrics and human evaluation for faithfulness, informativeness, and fluency \\cite{adams202289x}.\n    *   **Comparison Results**: Models trained on the *revised* clinical references significantly outperformed models trained on original or filtered data across all evaluated metrics (faithfulness, informativeness, and fluency), as confirmed by both automatic scores and human judgment \\cite{adams202289x}. This empirically validates the effectiveness of the reference revision approach.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The method relies on the accuracy of entity extraction (e.g., Amazon Comprehend Medical) and similarity scoring for determining entity support \\cite{adams202289x}. The definition of \"supported\" sentences uses heuristic thresholds (e.g., BERTScore precision >= 0.75) \\cite{adams202289x}. The realism of synthetically generated hallucinations by ReDRESS is crucial for effective training.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The approach is primarily validated in the context of clinical summarization (MIMIC-III), a domain characterized by high noise and limited resources \\cite{adams202289x}. However, as a data pre-processing step, it is designed to be model-agnostic and potentially applicable to other domains with noisy reference data \\cite{adams202289x}.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: This work significantly advances the state-of-the-art in faithful summarization by providing a novel, data-centric solution to the problem of noisy training references \\cite{adams202289x}. Instead of discarding data, it actively improves its quality, which is particularly critical for low-resource and noisy domains where filtering is detrimental \\cite{adams202289x}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: The proposed reference revision framework, especially the ReDRESS algorithm for synthetic data generation and the use of contrastive learning, opens new avenues for research in data augmentation and quality improvement for various NLP tasks. It encourages a shift towards \"data-centric AI\" in summarization. The release of code, pre-processed datasets, and models will facilitate further research in clinical summarization and the broader challenge of faithfulness in abstractive models \\cite{adams202289x}.",

        "abstract": "Advancement in large pretrained language models has significantly improved their performance for conditional language generation tasks including summarization albeit with hallucinations. To reduce hallucinations, conventional methods proposed improving beam search or using a fact checker as a postprocessing step. In this paper, we investigate the use of the Natural Language Inference (NLI) entailment metric to detect and prevent hallucinations in summary generation. We propose an NLI-assisted beam re-ranking mechanism by computing entailment probability scores between the input context and summarization model-generated beams during saliency-enhanced greedy decoding. Moreover, a diversity metric is introduced to compare its effectiveness against vanilla beam search. Our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms vanilla beam decoding on XSum and CNN/DM datasets.",
        "summary": "Here is a focused summary of the paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   The paper addresses the problem of **hallucinations** in abstractive summarization generated by large pretrained language models \\cite{sridhar2022l1c}.\n    *   This problem is critical due to the increasing commercial use of text-generative applications, which necessitates factual and reliable responses \\cite{sridhar2022l1c}.\n    *   It is challenging because pretraining on unlabeled data can lead models to learn inaccuracies and generate content not pertinent to the input document \\cite{sridhar2022l1c}. Existing mitigation methods often rely on heuristics, require extensive manual tuning, or add significant model complexity.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   Existing approaches to curb hallucination include modifying beam search (e.g., constraining decoding to input-supported tokens \\cite{king2022pinocchio}) or using fact checkers as a post-processing step \\cite{balachandran2022factedit}.\n    *   Limitations of previous solutions:\n        *   Heuristic-based beam search modifications (e.g., PINOCCHIO \\cite{king2022pinocchio}) require intricate knowledge of the dataset, task, and model for hyperparameter initialization, making them impractical for production systems with varying data distributions \\cite{sridhar2022l1c}. Simple word-level heuristics like cosine distance are ineffective for highly abstractive summarization \\cite{sridhar2022l1c}.\n        *   Fact correction models (e.g., FactEdit \\cite{balachandran2022factedit}) need to be fine-tuned for each dataset, increasing overall model complexity \\cite{sridhar2022l1c}.\n        *   Prior work using Natural Language Inference (NLI) models for re-ranking typically compared *complete* summary candidates with the context, finding that NLI entailment probability alone was insufficient to differentiate correct from incorrect beams \\cite{sridhar2022l1c}.\n        *   Architectural modifications are often not generalizable and require retraining existing summarizer models from scratch \\cite{sridhar2022l1c}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   The core technical method is an **NLI-assisted beam re-ranking mechanism** applied *during* the decoding phase of abstractive summarization \\cite{sridhar2022l1c}.\n    *   The approach involves:\n        1.  **Saliency-enhanced Greedy Rollout (SGR)**: Partial hypotheses (intermediate beams) are completed into full candidate beams using a greedy search. To address the issue of models not effectively attending to relevant context, SGR incorporates saliency on the context relative to the intermediate beam using attention head masking. Two versions are proposed: Saliency v1 (hard masking for extractive summaries) and Saliency v2 (variable soft attention for abstractive summaries) \\cite{sridhar2022l1c}.\n        2.  **NLI Scorer**: The completed candidate beams are then passed to an NLI model, which computes an entailment probability between the input context (premise) and the rolled-out beam (hypothesis). The paper hypothesizes that this entailment probability is inversely proportional to the hallucination content \\cite{sridhar2022l1c}.\n        3.  **Weighted Beam Re-ranker**: The NLI entailment score is incorporated into the overall cumulative beam probability by taking a weighted average with the model's original probability for each decoding step. Beams are then re-ranked based on this modified cumulative probability \\cite{sridhar2022l1c}.\n    *   This approach is novel because it introduces NLI-based semantic matching *at the token level during the decoding phase* to actively steer beam generation away from hallucinated regions, rather than as a post-processing step on complete summaries \\cite{sridhar2022l1c}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithm**: Development of a hallucination mitigation component for beam search that modifies the cumulative beam probability at the token level using the NLI metric \\cite{sridhar2022l1c}.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: Introduction of \"Saliency-enhanced Greedy Rollout\" with two variations (v1 for extractive, v2 for abstractive) to effectively complete partial hypotheses and ensure context relevance during NLI scoring \\cite{sridhar2022l1c}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: Investigation into the role of the `α` hyperparameter in guiding factual generation and its impact on beam diversity, demonstrating that non-zero `α` leads to more diverse and factually consistent beams \\cite{sridhar2022l1c}. The paper also highlights the limitations and inconsistencies of existing state-of-the-art factuality metrics (FactCC, SummaC, QGQA) across different datasets \\cite{sridhar2022l1c}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Datasets**: Experiments were conducted on two publicly available datasets: CNN/DM (multi-line, less abstractive) and XSum (one-line, highly abstractive) \\cite{sridhar2022l1c}.\n    *   **Metrics**: Performance was evaluated using multiple automatic factuality metrics (SummaC-Conv, SummaC-CZS, QGQA, FactCC) and, crucially, **human evaluation** \\cite{sridhar2022l1c}.\n    *   **Comparison Results**:\n        *   Automatic metrics showed inconsistent trends across datasets, with the proposed approach outperforming baselines on XSum (except QGQA) but FactEdit sometimes favored on CNN/DM \\cite{sridhar2022l1c}. This reinforced the paper's claim about the unreliability of current automatic metrics.\n        *   **Human evaluation** (50 instances, 4 annotators, 1-5 faithfulness score) consistently demonstrated that the proposed NLI-based re-ranker achieved a **higher faithfulness score** compared to baselines (vanilla beam search, PINNOCHIO \\cite{king2022pinocchio}, FactEdit \\cite{balachandran2022factedit}), bolstering the efficacy of the algorithm \\cite{sridhar2022l1c}.\n        *   Analysis showed that varying the `α` hyperparameter significantly impacted factual consistency and beam diversity, with non-zero `α` values leading to factually consistent and more diverse generations \\cite{sridhar2022l1c}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**: The NLI task is difficult to perform on partial hypotheses, necessitating the greedy rollout mechanism \\cite{sridhar2022l1c}. The re-ranking is only performed if the hypothesis has a predefined minimum number of words, as very short beams might lack necessary entities for hallucination measurement \\cite{sridhar2022l1c}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The method is demonstrated for abstractive summarization using BART-Base models but is designed to be easily generalizable and inference-time applicable \\cite{sridhar2022l1c}. The two saliency variations (v1, v2) aim to make it suitable for both extractive and abstractive summarization styles \\cite{sridhar2022l1c}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   This work significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing an **inference-time and easily generalizable** method for hallucination mitigation in abstractive summarization \\cite{sridhar2022l1c}.\n    *   By integrating NLI directly into the beam decoding process, it offers a more robust and semantically aware mechanism to guide generation towards factual consistency compared to heuristic-based or post-processing approaches \\cite{sridhar2022l1c}.\n    *   The explicit demonstration of the inconsistencies of current automatic factuality metrics, coupled with strong human evaluation results, highlights the need for more reliable benchmarks and validates the proposed approach's practical effectiveness \\cite{sridhar2022l1c}.\n    *   Potential impact on future research includes exploring optimal time steps for re-ranking hypotheses and investigating the NLI-based re-ranker's performance on other conditional language generation tasks \\cite{sridhar2022l1c}.",

        "abstract": "Dialogue systems powered by large pre-trained language models exhibit an innate ability to deliver fluent and natural-sounding responses. Despite their impressive performance, these models are fitful and can often generate factually incorrect statements impeding their widespread adoption. In this paper, we focus on the task of improving faithfulness and reducing hallucination of neural dialogue systems to known facts supplied by a Knowledge Graph (KG). We propose Neural Path Hunter which follows a generate-then-refine strategy whereby a generated response is amended using the KG. Neural Path Hunter leverages a separate token-level fact critic to identify plausible sources of hallucination followed by a refinement stage that retrieves correct entities by crafting a query signal that is propagated over a k-hop subgraph. We empirically validate our proposed approach on the OpenDialKG dataset (Moon et al., 2019) against a suite of metrics and report a relative improvement of faithfulness over dialogue responses by 20.35% based on FeQA (Durmus et al., 2020). The code is available at https://github.com/nouhadziri/Neural-Path-Hunter.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \\cite{dziri2021bw9} for a literature review:\n\n### Technical Paper Analysis: Neural Path Hunter: Reducing Hallucination in Dialogue Systems via Path Grounding \\cite{dziri2021bw9}\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Addresses the problem of factual hallucination in neural dialogue systems powered by large pre-trained language models, where models generate factually incorrect statements despite fluent responses.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: Hallucinations impede the widespread adoption of dialogue systems, making responses uninformative and jeopardizing conversation. Existing knowledge grounding approaches often suffer from a \"source-reference divergence problem,\" where training on references alone is insufficient to guarantee faithfulness to auxiliary knowledge (e.g., Knowledge Graphs). Ensuring precise alignment between source knowledge and generated responses remains an open challenge.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: This work builds upon knowledge-grounded dialogue systems that leverage external Knowledge Graphs (KGs).\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Previous knowledge grounding methods often face the \"source-reference divergence problem,\" where the reference data contains additional factual information not fully captured by the source KG, making simple training insufficient to guarantee factual faithfulness \\cite{dziri2021bw9}. This leads to an inherent lack of controllability over factual correctness in large language models.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: \\cite{dziri2021bw9} proposes **NEURAL PATH HUNTER (NPH)**, a generate-then-refine strategy that amends a generated response using a Knowledge Graph (KG). NPH operates in two main stages:\n        1.  **Token-level Hallucination Critic**: Identifies and masks out plausible sources of hallucination (specifically, erroneous entity mentions) within a generated utterance. This critic is trained on a synthetic dataset of corrupted ground-truth responses (extrinsic and intrinsic negatives).\n        2.  **Entity Mention Retriever**: Takes the masked representations from the critic, uses a Masked Language Model (MLM) to obtain contextual representations, and then an autoregressive LM to craft a query signal. This query is propagated over a local k-hop subgraph of the KG (represented as \"KG-Entity Memory\" using GPT2 embeddings or CompGCN) to retrieve factually correct entities.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**: NPH is novel in its two-stage, generate-then-refine approach that explicitly identifies and corrects hallucinated entities by querying a KG. It works without further fine-tuning the base dialogue generation model and models dialogue as a signal propagated on a local k-hop subgraph to retrieve correct entities.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**:\n        *   **NEURAL PATH HUNTER (NPH)**: A module for reducing hallucination in machine-generated dialogue responses by leveraging KG facts.\n        *   **Token-level Hallucination Critic**: A sequence labeling model trained on synthetic data to identify and mask hallucinated entity mentions.\n        *   **Entity Mention Retriever**: A module that crafts contextual queries from masked entities and retrieves correct entities by scoring against a KG-Entity Memory.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: A generate-then-refine architecture that decouples hallucination detection from correction, allowing for post-hoc refinement of any generated response.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: Conducted a comprehensive human study revealing that the main mode of hallucination in KG-grounded dialogue systems is the injection of erroneous entities (extrinsic hallucinations), and that increased response diversity often correlates with increased hallucination.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**:\n        *   A systematic human study on hallucination modes in GPT-2 generated responses on OpenDialKG, using various decoding strategies.\n        *   Empirical validation of NPH's ability to reduce hallucinations in KG-grounded dialogue systems.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results**:\n        *   Evaluated on the **OpenDialKG dataset** \\cite{dziri2021bw9}.\n        *   Achieved a **relative improvement of 20.35% in faithfulness** based on **FeQA** (a QA-based faithfulness metric) \\cite{dziri2021bw9}.\n        *   Demonstrated an **improvement of 39.98% in human evaluation** for faithfulness \\cite{dziri2021bw9}.\n        *   Human study showed that extrinsic hallucinations are the most common, and greedy decoding results in the least hallucination, while top-k sampling leads to the highest.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**:\n        *   Assumes the availability of a Knowledge Graph (KG) for refinement.\n        *   Relies on a local k-hop subgraph being either provided or extractable based on dialogue history.\n        *   The synthetic data generation for the critic might not perfectly capture all real-world hallucination patterns.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: Applicable to any machine-generated response as long as an auxiliary KG is provided, and it works without requiring further fine-tuning of the base generation model. The primary focus is on correcting entity misattributions.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: \\cite{dziri2021bw9} significantly advances the state-of-the-art in reducing factual hallucination in neural dialogue systems by providing a robust, post-hoc refinement mechanism.

In this paper, we systematically study the object hallucination problem from three aspects. First, we examine recent state-of-the-art VLP models, showing that they still hallucinate frequently and models achieving better scores on standard metrics (e.g., CIDEr) could be more unfaithful. Second, we investigate how different types of image encoding in VLP influence hallucination, including region-based, grid-based, and patch-based. Surprisingly, we find that patch-based features perform the best and smaller patch resolution yields a non-trivial reduction in object hallucination. Third, we decouple various VLP objectives and demonstrate that token-level image-text alignment and controlled generation are crucial to reducing hallucination. Based on that, we propose a simple yet effective VLP loss named ObjMLM to further mitigate object hallucination. Results show that it reduces object hallucination by up to 17.4% when tested on two benchmarks (COCO Caption for in-domain and NoCaps for out-of-domain evaluation).",

Despite its criticality, this problem has not been systematically studied in contemporary VLP research \\cite{dai20229aa}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Previous work on hallucination in deep learning includes data refinement, scene graph learning, localized region reconstruction, uncertainty-aware beam search, knowledge augmentation, and post-processing for various tasks (e.g., data-to-text, dialog systems, QA).\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: While general hallucination has been addressed, how different VLP strategies (e.g., pre-training objectives, image encoding methods) influence the faithfulness of generated text given images has not been systematically studied \\cite{dai20229aa}. This paper is positioned as the *first* to systematically investigate object hallucination in state-of-the-art VLP models.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper systematically studies object hallucination from three key aspects:\n        1.  **Examination of SOTA VLP Models**: Quantifying hallucination rates and observing that models achieving better standard metrics (e.g., CIDEr) can be *more* unfaithful.\n        2.  **Investigation of Image Encoding**: Ablating the influence of region-based, grid-based, and patch-based image features on hallucination.\n        3.  **Decoupling VLP Objectives**: Analyzing the effects of Image-Text Contrastive (ITC), Image-Text Matching (ITM), and Image-Conditioned Language Modeling (ICLM) losses.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**: Based on these insights, the paper proposes a novel VLP loss called **ObjMLM (Object-Masked Language Modeling)**. This objective aims to mitigate object hallucination by enhancing the alignment and restriction between text tokens and visual objects during generation, a direct approach to improving faithfulness \\cite{dai20229aa}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**: Introduction of **ObjMLM**, a simple yet effective pre-training objective designed to reduce object hallucination by improving token-level image-text alignment and controlled generation.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**:\n        *   First systematic study demonstrating that state-of-the-art VLP models still frequently hallucinate, and that optimizing for standard metrics like CIDEr (e.g., via SCST) can paradoxically *increase* hallucination \\cite{dai20229aa}.\n        *   Empirical finding that patch-based image features perform best in reducing hallucination, with smaller patch resolutions yielding significant reductions.\n        *   Analysis showing that token-level image-text alignment (ICLM) is crucial for reducing hallucination, while global alignment objectives like ITC and ITM contribute less.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**:\n        *   Evaluation of object hallucination in various SOTA VLP models (OSCAR, VinVL, BLIP, OFA) on image captioning.\n        *   Ablation studies on different image encoding methods (region, grid, patch) and VLP objectives (ITC, ITM, ICLM).\n        *   Evaluation of the proposed ObjMLM loss.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**: CHAIR_i (instance-level hallucination) and CHAIR_s (sentence-level hallucination) were used, alongside standard captioning metrics (BLEU-4, CIDEr, METEOR, SPICE).\n    *   **Comparison Results**:\n        *   SOTA models exhibit frequent hallucination (e.g., ~10% of sentences contain hallucinated objects in-domain, much higher out-of-domain).\n        *   SCST optimization, while boosting standard metrics, increased CHAIR_s by up to 0.9 on COCO Caption and 10.9% on NoCaps for VinVL Base \\cite{dai20229aa}.\n        *   Patch-based features outperformed region- and grid-based features, with smaller patch resolutions reducing hallucination.\n        *   ObjMLM successfully reduced object hallucination by up to **17.4%** on two benchmarks (COCO Caption for in-domain and NoCaps for out-of-domain evaluation) without introducing extra training data \\cite{dai20229aa}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The paper primarily focuses on *object* hallucination in VLP models for text generation. While ObjMLM is effective, the paper does not extensively discuss potential trade-offs with other aspects of generation (e.g., fluency, diversity) or its applicability to other types of hallucination (e.g., factual inaccuracies not related to objects). The CHAIR metric relies on pre-defined object categories, which might not capture all nuances of hallucination.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The findings and proposed method are directly applicable to VLP models used for image-conditioned text generation tasks, particularly image captioning, and aim to improve their faithfulness regarding visual objects.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: This work provides the first systematic and comprehensive study of object hallucination in modern VLP models, revealing a critical and often overlooked flaw. It quantifies the problem and identifies key architectural and training objective factors influencing it.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: The findings offer valuable guidance for designing more responsible and faithful VLP systems. The revelation that standard metric optimization can worsen faithfulness challenges current evaluation paradigms and encourages the development of new metrics and training strategies that prioritize factual grounding. The proposed ObjMLM loss provides a concrete, effective method for mitigating object hallucination, paving the way for future research into more robust and reliable VLP models \\cite{dai20229aa}.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in large-scale pre-training provide large models with the potential to learn knowledge from the raw text. It is thus natural to ask whether it is possible to leverage these large models as knowledge bases for downstream tasks. In this work, we answer the aforementioned question in unsupervised knowledge-grounded conversation. We explore various methods that best elicit knowledge from large models. Our human study indicates that, though hallucinations exist, large models post the unique advantage of being able to output common sense and summarize facts that cannot be directly retrieved from the search engine. To better exploit such generated knowledge in dialogue generation, we treat the generated knowledge as a noisy knowledge source and propose the posterior-based reweighing as well as the noisy training strategy. Empirical results on two benchmarks show advantages over the state-of-the-art methods.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Problem:** The paper addresses the challenge of providing external knowledge for unsupervised knowledge-grounded conversation, specifically exploring how to leverage large pre-trained models (LPMs) as dynamic knowledge bases \\cite{li2022ypy}.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** Traditional knowledge bases are expensive and time-consuming to construct and maintain. While LPMs show potential for internalizing knowledge and even performing implicit reasoning, they are prone to \"hallucinations\" (generating plausible but factually incorrect information), making their direct use risky \\cite{li2022ypy}. The core challenge is to effectively elicit and exploit this noisy, generated knowledge.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches:** Prior work in knowledge-grounded conversation typically relies on retrieving knowledge from pre-defined external sources like unstructured documents (e.g., Wikipedia) or structured knowledge graphs \\cite{li2022ypy}. Models like PLATO-KAG, SKT, and KnowledGPT are representative of these approaches, featuring knowledge selection and response generation modules \\cite{li2022ypy}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:** These methods are constrained by the availability and cost of maintaining explicit knowledge bases. Furthermore, existing response generators may not be robust to imperfect or noisy knowledge selection, leading to a training-inference discrepancy \\cite{li2022ypy}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Method:**\n        *   **Knowledge Elicitation:** The paper systematically investigates various tuning methods (fine-tuning, prefix-tuning) and large pre-trained models (PLMs like T5, PDMs like DialoGPT) to generate relevant knowledge from dialogue history \\cite{li2022ypy}.\n        *   **Posterior-based Reweighing:** It treats the generated knowledge from LPMs as a *noisy knowledge source*. This generated knowledge is used to refine the initial knowledge selection distribution by measuring its similarity to retrieved knowledge candidates. This refined distribution is then further updated using a posterior estimation, leveraging the response generator's likelihood to select more appropriate knowledge given the potential future response \\cite{li2022ypy}.\n        *   **Noisy Training Strategy:** To make the response generator more resilient to noisy knowledge during inference, the Gumbel-TopK trick is employed during training. This introduces noise into the knowledge selection process, perturbing the ranking of candidates and strengthening the model's ability to handle imperfect inputs \\cite{li2022ypy}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:** This work is novel in systematically exploring LPMs as dynamic knowledge bases for unsupervised knowledge-grounded conversation. It introduces a unique strategy to mitigate LPM hallucinations by treating their output as a noisy signal for reweighing existing knowledge, rather than direct input. The combination of posterior estimation with generated knowledge-based reweighing and a specific noisy training strategy (Gumbel-TopK) is a key innovation \\cite{li2022ypy}.

Notably, a significant portion of supported facts were *implicitly supported* (summarized/reasoned, not direct copies), and some unvalidated facts aligned with *common sense* \\cite{li2022ypy}.\n        *   The proposed method achieved significant improvements in automatic metrics (PPL, F1, P@1) over state-of-the-art baselines (TMN, SKT, KnowledGPT, PLATO-KAG) on the Wizard of Wikipedia (WoW) and Holl-E datasets \\cite{li2022ypy}.\n        *   Human evaluation confirmed improvements in Coherence, Informativeness, and Engagingness, while maintaining low Hallucination rates, validating the effectiveness of the noisy knowledge handling strategies \\cite{li2022ypy}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** Hallucinations from LPMs persist, necessitating the proposed robust handling mechanisms. The posterior estimation relies on an approximation (mean token probability), and the method requires hyper-parameter tuning for reweighing and posterior sharpness \\cite{li2022ypy}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The approach is primarily focused on unsupervised knowledge-grounded conversation. It is particularly applicable in scenarios where dynamic, on-demand knowledge is preferred over static, pre-constructed knowledge bases \\cite{li2022ypy}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art:** This paper advances the state-of-the-art by demonstrating a viable and effective method for leveraging large pre-trained models as dynamic knowledge sources for knowledge-grounded conversation, moving beyond the limitations of static knowledge bases \\cite{li2022ypy}. It provides robust strategies to manage the inherent noise (hallucinations) in LPM-generated knowledge, making their outputs practically usable \\cite{li2022ypy}.\n    *   **Potential Impact:** This work opens new research directions for dynamic knowledge acquisition in dialogue systems, potentially reducing the reliance on costly manual knowledge base construction. The proposed noisy training and reweighing strategies could inspire similar approaches for other NLP tasks dealing with uncertain or noisy information from large models, contributing to more scalable and adaptable conversational AI \\cite{li2022ypy}.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as pivotal contributors in contemporary natural language processing and are increasingly being applied across a diverse range of industries. However, these large-scale probabilistic statistical models cannot currently ensure the requisite quality in professional content generation. These models often produce hallucinated text, compromising their practical utility in professional contexts. To assess the authentic reliability of LLMs in text generation, numerous initiatives have developed benchmark evaluations for hallucination phenomena. Nevertheless, these benchmarks frequently utilize constrained generation techniques due to cost and temporal constraints. These techniques encompass the use of directed hallucination induction and strategies that deliberately alter authentic text to produce hallucinations. These approaches are not congruent with the unrestricted text generation demanded by real-world applications. Furthermore, a well-established Chinese-language dataset dedicated to the evaluation of hallucinations in text generation is presently lacking. Consequently, we have developed an Unconstrained Hallucination Generation Evaluation (UHGEval) benchmark, designed to compile outputs produced with minimal restrictions by LLMs. Concurrently, we have established a comprehensive benchmark evaluation framework to aid subsequent researchers in undertaking scalable and reproducible experiments. We have also executed extensive experiments, evaluating prominent Chinese language models and the GPT series models to derive professional performance insights regarding hallucination challenges.",

However, little is understood about this fine-tuning process, including what knowledge is retained from pre-training time or how content selection and generation strategies are learnt across iterations. In this work, we analyze the training dynamics for generation models, focusing on summarization. Across different datasets (CNN/DM, XSum, MediaSum) and summary properties, such as abstractiveness and hallucination, we study what the model learns at different stages of its fine-tuning process. We find that a propensity to copy the input is learned early in the training process consistently across all datasets studied. On the other hand, factual errors, such as hallucination of unsupported facts, are learnt in the later stages, though this behavior is more varied across domains. Based on these observations, we explore complementary approaches for modifying training: first, disregarding high-loss tokens that are challenging to learn and second, disregarding low-loss tokens that are learnt very quickly in the latter stages of the training process. We show that these simple training modifications allow us to configure our model to achieve different goals, such as improving factuality or improving abstractiveness.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **1. Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** Despite the impressive performance of pre-trained language models (PLMs) like BART when fine-tuned for abstractive summarization, there is a significant lack of understanding regarding *what knowledge* is retained from pre-training and *how content selection and generation strategies* are learned across training iterations \\cite{goyal2021onb}.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** Abstractive summarization is a complex task involving implicit content selection and rewriting. Existing work on training dynamics primarily focuses on sequence classification, which differs substantially from text generation due to its sequential nature of predictions and the mismatch between teacher-forced training and inference time. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for developing more robust and controllable summarization models \\cite{goyal2021onb}.\n\n*   **2. Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** The work builds upon the success of Transformer-based pre-training for summarization \\cite{goyal2021onb}. It extends the concept of studying training dynamics, which has been applied to sequence classification tasks (e.g., NLI, fact verification) to mitigate dataset biases \\cite{goyal2021onb}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:** Prior analyses of training dynamics are not directly transferable to text generation due due to its unique characteristics. The paper also highlights that simply training for more iterations is often insufficient to achieve desired abstractiveness or factuality, necessitating deeper modifications to the training procedure \\cite{goyal2021onb}.\n\n*   **3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper first conducts an in-depth analysis of the fine-tuning dynamics of BART-LARGE and PEGASUS-LARGE models for summarization across three diverse datasets: XSUM (highly abstractive), CNNDM, and MEDIASUM (more extractive) \\cite{goyal2021onb}. This analysis involves:\n        *   Monitoring n-gram overlap (as a proxy for abstractiveness) of generated summaries at different training stages.\n        *   Evaluating Sentence Error Rate (SER) for factual consistency using pre-trained factuality models.\n        *   Analyzing token-level output probabilities for both high/low overlap examples and factual/hallucinated content in reference summaries.\n        *   **Key Findings from Analysis:** Copy behavior is learned very early. Models tend to overfit to \"easier\" (more extractive) examples, especially in CNNDM and MEDIASUM, failing to achieve target abstractiveness. Factual errors (hallucinations) are learned in later stages, particularly on noisy datasets like XSUM, where factual content is predicted with higher confidence than hallucinated content \\cite{goyal2021onb}.\n    *   **Novelty:** Based on these insights, the paper proposes a novel **loss truncation strategy (Algorithm 1: `LOSSTRUNCATION`)** to dynamically modify the loss computation during the later stages of training. This involves **token sub-sampling** based on loss magnitude:\n        *   **`+Abstractive` models:** Exclude low-loss tokens from the final loss calculation, assuming these are easily learned extractive tokens, thereby encouraging more abstractive generation.\n        *   **`+Factuality` models:** Exclude high-loss tokens from the final loss calculation, assuming these correspond to challenging-to-learn or hallucinated content, thereby improving factual consistency.\n        *   A dynamic threshold `q` (controlled by a percentile `p`) is used to identify high/low loss tokens, updated based on recent loss statistics \\cite{goyal2021onb}. This dynamic, property-specific loss modification for generation tasks is a key innovation.\n\n*   **4. Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms, Methods, or Techniques:**\n        *   The first comprehensive analysis of training dynamics for abstractive summarization models, specifically investigating the learning trajectories of abstractiveness and factual consistency \\cite{goyal2021onb}.\n        *   Introduction of a dynamic **loss truncation algorithm (`LOSSTRUNCATION`)** that employs token sub-sampling based on loss magnitude to explicitly steer model learning towards desired summarization properties (abstractiveness or factuality) \\cite{goyal2021onb}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights or Analysis:**\n        *   Empirical demonstration that \"easy-to-learn\" behaviors like copying are acquired early, while factual errors emerge later and are linked to dataset noise and abstractiveness levels \\cite{goyal2021onb}.\n        *   Observation that models overfit to more extractive examples, hindering the learning of abstractive generation, and that factual tokens are learned with higher confidence than hallucinated tokens \\cite{goyal2021onb}.\n\n*   **5. Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:**\n        *   Analysis of n-gram overlap (abstractiveness) and Sentence Error Rate (SER) for factuality across 10 training checkpoints on XSUM, CNNDM, and MEDIASUM datasets using BART-LARGE and PEGASUS-LARGE models \\cite{goyal2021onb}.\n        *   Comparison of token-level output probabilities for high-overlap vs. low-overlap reference summaries and for factual vs. hallucinated content to understand learning patterns \\cite{goyal2021onb}.\n        *   Application of the proposed `LOSSTRUNCATION` method (`+Abstractive` and `+Factuality` variants) to modify training and evaluate its impact on generated summaries \\cite{goyal2021onb}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results:**\n        *   **Abstractiveness:** XSUM models achieved target abstractiveness early, while CNNDM and MEDIASUM models consistently failed to reach target levels, stabilizing at higher n-gram overlap \\cite{goyal2021onb}.\n        *   **Factuality:** SER was roughly proportional to abstractiveness, with XSUM showing higher error rates. For CNNDM/MEDIASUM, SER trajectories mirrored abstractiveness changes \\cite{goyal2021onb}.\n        *   **Impact of Loss Truncation:** The proposed training modifications allowed for configuring models to achieve different goals:\n            *   `+Factuality` models substantially improved factuality for noisy datasets (e.g., XSUM) by downweighting high-loss tokens, while preserving abstractiveness \\cite{goyal2021onb}.\n            *   `+Abstractive` models significantly improved the abstractiveness of generated summaries for relatively extractive datasets (e.g., CNNDM, MEDIASUM) by downweighting low-loss tokens \\cite{goyal2021onb}.\n\n*   **6. Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The method relies on the assumption that high-loss tokens in later training stages for noisy datasets correlate with hallucinated content, and low-loss tokens for extractive datasets correspond to easily learned extractive content. The effectiveness is tied to the accuracy of these assumptions and the dynamic thresholding mechanism. Factuality assessment relies on external pre-trained factuality models \\cite{goyal2021onb}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The analysis and proposed method are primarily focused on abstractive text summarization using Transformer-based PLMs (BART, PEGASUS) and news-style datasets. While the insights into training dynamics may generalize, the specific loss truncation strategy is tailored to address the observed abstractiveness and factuality issues in these contexts \\cite{goyal2021onb}.\n\n*   **7. Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** This work significantly advances the understanding of how complex behaviors like abstractiveness and factual consistency are learned during the fine-tuning of PLMs for text generation. It moves beyond black-box performance metrics to dissect the internal learning process \\cite{goyal2021onb}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:**\n        *   Provides a novel methodology for analyzing training dynamics in generation tasks, which can be extended to other complex NLP generation tasks \\cite{goyal2021onb}.\n        *   Introduces an interpretable and effective training modification technique (loss truncation via token sub-sampling) that allows researchers to explicitly control and optimize for specific desired output properties (e.g., factuality, abstractiveness) \\cite{goyal2021onb}.\n        *   Highlights the limitations of simply \"training longer\" and the need for targeted interventions, opening avenues for more sophisticated curriculum learning or adaptive training strategies in generation \\cite{goyal2021onb}.",

        "abstract": "\n While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a range of downstream tasks, a significant concern revolves around their propensity to exhibit hallucinations: LLMs occasionally generate content that diverges from the user input, contradicts previously generated context, or misaligns with established world knowledge. This phenomenon poses a substantial challenge to the reliability of LLMs in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we survey recent efforts on the detection, explanation, and mitigation of hallucination, with an emphasis on the unique challenges posed by LLMs. We present taxonomies of the LLM hallucination phenomena and evaluation benchmarks, analyze existing approaches aiming at mitigating LLM hallucination, and discuss potential directions for future research.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **CITATION REQUIREMENTS**: Always use \"\\cite{zhang2023k1j}\" when referencing this paper.\n\n---\n\n**TECHNICAL PAPER ANALYSIS**:\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **What specific technical problem does this paper address?**\n        This paper addresses the pervasive problem of \"hallucination\" in Large Language Models (LLMs), where models generate content that deviates from user input, contradicts previously generated context, or misaligns with established world knowledge \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n    *   **Why is this problem important and challenging?**\n        Hallucination significantly undermines the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs in real-world applications, potentially leading to severe consequences (e.g., fabricating erroneous medical diagnoses). The problem is particularly challenging for LLMs due to:\n        *   **Massive training data:** Pre-training on web-scale data often includes fabricated, outdated, or biased information, making it difficult to eliminate sources of hallucination \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n        *   **Versatility of LLMs:** Their general-purpose nature across tasks, languages, and domains complicates comprehensive evaluation and robust mitigation strategies \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n        *   **Imperceptibility of errors:** LLMs can generate highly plausible, yet false, information that is difficult for both models and humans to detect \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n        *   Additional factors like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), vague knowledge boundaries, and the black-box nature of LLMs further complicate detection, explanation, and mitigation \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **How does this work relate to existing approaches?**\n        While hallucination has been extensively studied in conventional Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks, this survey specifically focuses on the *unique and amplified challenges* presented by LLMs \\cite{zhang2023k1j}. It positions itself as a comprehensive review of recent efforts tailored to the LLM era.\n    *   **What are the limitations of previous solutions?**\n        Previous studies on hallucination in traditional NLG are often task-specific and do not adequately address the complexities arising from LLMs' massive scale, versatility, and the subtle nature of their errors \\cite{zhang2023k1j}. The paper highlights that while input- and context-conflicting hallucinations were previously explored, *fact-conflicting hallucination* in LLMs poses more complex challenges due to the absence of an authoritative knowledge source and its greater practical impact \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **What is the core technical method or algorithm?**\n        As a survey, the core technical approach is a systematic and comprehensive review and structured analysis of the current landscape of LLM hallucination research \\cite{zhang2023k1j}. This involves:\n        *   Defining and categorizing LLM hallucination into three distinct types: input-conflicting, context-conflicting, and fact-conflicting \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n        *   Presenting taxonomies of hallucination phenomena and evaluation benchmarks.\n        *   Analyzing potential sources of hallucination and reviewing existing mitigation approaches across the LLM lifecycle (pre-training, SFT, RLHF, inference) \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n        *   Discussing future research directions.\n    *   **What makes this approach novel or different?**\n        The novelty lies in providing a timely, structured, and LLM-centric overview of hallucination, emphasizing the unique challenges and the predominant research focus on fact-conflicting hallucinations \\cite{zhang2023k1j}. It offers a systematic framework for understanding and addressing this critical problem, clearly distinguishing it from other LLM issues like ambiguity or incompleteness \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel algorithms, methods, or techniques:**\n        *   A clear and expanded **taxonomy of LLM hallucination**, categorizing it into Input-conflicting, Context-conflicting, and Fact-conflicting types, complete with illustrative examples \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n        *   An analytical framework that explores the **sources of LLM hallucinations** and systematically reviews **mitigation strategies** throughout the LLM lifecycle (pre-training, supervised finetuning (SFT), reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and inference) \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n        *   Detailed identification and discussion of the **unique challenges** of hallucination in the LLM era, including issues related to massive training data, model versatility, and the imperceptibility of errors \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n    *   **System design or architectural innovations:** Not applicable as this is a survey paper.\n    *   **Theoretical insights or analysis:** The paper provides a conceptual framework for understanding the multifaceted nature of LLM hallucination and its distinction from other LLM problems \\cite{zhang2023k1j}. It also highlights the shift in research focus towards fact-conflicting hallucinations due to their inherent complexity and significant practical implications \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **What experiments were conducted?**\n        As a survey, the paper does not conduct its own experiments.\n    *   **Key performance metrics and comparison results:**\n        The paper *reviews* and *introduces* relevant benchmarks and metrics used in the field for evaluating LLM hallucination \\cite{zhang2023k1j}. It categorizes these benchmarks according to the defined hallucination types, such as Input-conflicting Benchmarks (e.g., BEGIN, QMSum), Context-conflicting Benchmarks (e.g., HADES), and Fact-conflicting Benchmarks (e.g., TruthfulQA, FActScore, HaluEval, FACTOR) \\cite{zhang2023k1j}. This provides a crucial overview of the empirical landscape for future research.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical limitations or assumptions:**\n        The survey primarily concentrates on **fact-conflicting hallucinations**, acknowledging that input- and context-conflicting types have been extensively studied in conventional NLG and are particularly prone to occur in long-context scenarios involving LLMs \\cite{zhang2023k1j}. It also notes the ongoing debate regarding the classification of unverifiable content as hallucination \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n    *   **Scope of applicability:**\n        The survey focuses on hallucination specifically within the context of Large Language Models, addressing challenges arising from their scale, versatility, and training paradigms \\cite{zhang2023k1j}. It aims to cover recent publications from the past few years to ensure the timeliness of its insights \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **How does this advance the technical state-of-the-art?**\n        This survey significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing a much-needed, comprehensive, and up-to-date overview of LLM hallucination \\cite{zhang2023k1j}. It synthesizes diverse research efforts, clarifies definitions, and structures the problem space, which is crucial for a rapidly evolving field. By distinguishing hallucination from other LLM issues, it refines the understanding of LLM failures \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n    *   **Potential impact on future research:**\n        The paper's taxonomies, analysis of sources and mitigation strategies, and discussion of unique challenges provide a foundational roadmap for future research \\cite{zhang2023k1j}. It explicitly points out future research directions and encourages further discourse on complex issues like unverifiable content, thereby guiding researchers toward critical unsolved problems in improving LLM reliability and trustworthiness \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.

        "abstract": "Generation of plausible yet incorrect factual information, termed hallucination, is an unsolved issue in large language models. We study the ability of language models to deliberate on the responses they give in order to correct their mistakes. We develop the Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) method whereby the model first (i) drafts an initial response; then (ii) plans verification questions to fact-check its draft; (iii) answers those questions independently so the answers are not biased by other responses; and (iv) generates its final verified response. In experiments, we show CoVe decreases hallucinations across a variety of tasks, from list-based questions from Wikidata, closed book MultiSpanQA and longform text generation.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n### Technical Paper Analysis: Chain-of-Verification Reduces Hallucination in Large Language Models \\cite{dhuliawala2023rqn}\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the persistent issue of \"hallucination\" in Large Language Models (LLMs), where models generate plausible but factually incorrect information. This is particularly problematic for lesser-known facts and in longform text generation where errors can compound.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: Hallucinations undermine the trustworthiness and reliability of LLM outputs, limiting their applicability in critical domains. It's challenging because even the largest models, despite improved reasoning capabilities, still exhibit this behavior, and simply scaling up doesn't resolve it.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: This work falls under \"generation-time correction\" methods, which aim to improve LLM reliability by adding reasoning decisions on top of the base model. It builds on research encouraging LLMs to generate internal thoughts or reasoning chains (e.g., Chain-of-Thought) and self-critique.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   **Training-time correction**: Requires adjusting model weights, which can be complex.\n        *   **Generation-time correction**: Some methods rely on token probabilities or multiple samples, which may not always be robust. Approaches using inconsistencies (e.g., LM vs LM) are related but often involve multi-agent setups.\n        *   **Augmentation (tool-use)**: While effective (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation), CoVe specifically focuses on *self-correction* using only the LLM's internal knowledge, without external tools like search engines.\n        *   **Self-critique/verification**: Previous self-verification methods often focus on logical/mathematical tasks or specific question-answer formats, whereas CoVe targets factual hallucination across diverse generation tasks. CoVe's \"factored\" approach specifically addresses the issue of LLMs repeating their own hallucinations when conditioning on prior incorrect generations.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method (Chain-of-Verification - CoVe)**: CoVe is a four-step process designed to enable an LLM to deliberate on and correct its own responses:\n        1.  **Generate Baseline Response**: The LLM produces an initial draft.\n        2.  **Plan Verifications**: Conditioned on the query and baseline response, the LLM generates a list of specific verification questions to fact-check claims in the draft.\n        3.  **Execute Verifications**: The LLM answers these verification questions. Crucially, several variants are explored:\n            *   **Joint**: Planning and execution in a single prompt, potentially leading to repetition.\n            *   **2-Step**: Separates planning (conditions on baseline) and execution (answers questions without conditioning on baseline) to reduce repetition.\n            *   **Factored**: Answers *each* verification question independently as a separate prompt, without conditioning on the original baseline response or other verification answers. This is the most sophisticated and aims to minimize bias and repetition.\n            *   **Factor+Revise**: Adds an explicit cross-checking step after factored execution to detect inconsistencies.\n        4.  **Generate Final Verified Response**: The LLM produces a revised response, incorporating the insights and corrections from the verification steps.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   **Systematic Self-Deliberation**: CoVe provides a structured, multi-step framework for LLMs to self-critique and verify factual claims *internally*, without external tools.\n        *   **Independent Verification Execution**: The \"factored\" variant is particularly novel, ensuring that verification questions are answered independently of the potentially hallucinated baseline response and other verification answers, thereby preventing the model from repeating its own mistakes. This addresses the \"exposure bias\" problem.\n        *   **LLM-only Verification**: Unlike retrieval-augmented methods, CoVe relies solely on the LLM's inherent knowledge and reasoning capabilities for verification.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithm/Method**: Introduction of the Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) method, a multi-stage self-correction pipeline for LLMs.\n    *   **Algorithmic Innovations**: Development of \"factored\" variants for executing verification questions, which significantly reduce the likelihood of repeating hallucinations by answering questions independently of the initial response and other verification contexts.\n    *   **System Design**: A modular design where each step (draft, plan, execute, revise) is performed by prompting the same base LLM, allowing for flexible integration and variant exploration.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: CoVe was evaluated across a variety of tasks:\n        *   **List-based questions**: Wikidata (easier) and Wiki-Category list (harder), requiring generation of sets of entities.\n        *   **Closed-book MultiSpanQA**: Factoid-based questions with multiple independent answers.\n        *   **Longform text generation**: Generating biographies of entities.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results**:\n        *   **Metrics**: Precision (for list-based tasks), FACTSCORE (for longform biographies), and average number of positive/negative (hallucinated) entities.\n        *   **Baselines**: Llama 65B (few-shot), Llama 2 70B Chat (zero-shot, CoT).\n        *   **Results**:\n            *   CoVe consistently decreased hallucinations and improved precision across all tasks compared to baseline LLM generations.\n            *   On Wikidata, Llama 65B CoVe (two-step) achieved 0.36 precision vs. 0.17 for Llama 65B Few-shot, significantly reducing negative entities (0.68 vs 2.95).\n            *   On Wiki-Category list, Llama 65B CoVe (factored) achieved 0.22 precision vs. 0.12 for Llama 65B Few-shot.\n            *   The \"factored\" and \"two-step\" variants generally outperformed the \"joint\" method, demonstrating the importance of separating verification steps and avoiding conditioning on the initial response.\n            *   For longform biography generation, CoVe significantly improved FACTSCORE, indicating higher factual correctness.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**:\n        *   Relies on the base LLM's ability to generate and execute verification plans, and to reason about inconsistencies.\n        *   Does not explore tool-use (e.g., retrieval-augmentation via search engines) for verification, relying solely on the LLM's internal knowledge.\n        *   The \"factored\" approach, while effective, can be computationally more expensive due to requiring many separate LLM prompts, though these can be batched.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: Primarily demonstrated for factual hallucination in text generation tasks (list generation, QA, biographies). While the principles might extend, its direct applicability to other types of LLM errors (e.g., logical fallacies, coherence issues) is not explicitly explored.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advance State-of-the-Art**: CoVe significantly advances the state-of-the-art in reducing factual hallucinations in LLMs by introducing a systematic, self-deliberative framework. It demonstrates that LLMs can effectively self-correct by planning and executing internal verification steps.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n        *   **Enhanced LLM Reliability**: Provides a robust method for improving the factual accuracy of LLM outputs, making them more trustworthy for various applications.\n        *   **Self-Correction Paradigms**: Opens avenues for further research into more sophisticated LLM self-correction mechanisms, potentially integrating external tools with internal deliberation.\n        *   **Understanding LLM Reasoning**: Offers insights into how LLMs can be prompted to perform complex reasoning and self-critique, moving beyond simple next-token prediction.\n        *   **Mitigating Exposure Bias**: The success of factored variants highlights the importance of careful context management in multi-step LLM reasoning to prevent error propagation.",

        "abstract": "The prevalent use of large language models (LLMs) in various domains has drawn attention to the issue of\"hallucination,\"which refers to instances where LLMs generate factually inaccurate or ungrounded information. Existing techniques for hallucination detection in language assistants rely on intricate fuzzy, specific free-language-based chain of thought (CoT) techniques or parameter-based methods that suffer from interpretability issues. Additionally, the methods that identify hallucinations post-generation could not prevent their occurrence and suffer from inconsistent performance due to the influence of the instruction format and model style. In this paper, we introduce a novel pre-detection self-evaluation technique, referred to as SELF-FAMILIARITY, which focuses on evaluating the model's familiarity with the concepts present in the input instruction and withholding the generation of response in case of unfamiliar concepts. This approach emulates the human ability to refrain from responding to unfamiliar topics, thus reducing hallucinations. We validate SELF-FAMILIARITY across four different large language models, demonstrating consistently superior performance compared to existing techniques. Our findings propose a significant shift towards preemptive strategies for hallucination mitigation in LLM assistants, promising improvements in reliability, applicability, and interpretability.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   The paper addresses the critical issue of \"hallucination\" in Large Language Models (LLMs), where models generate factually inaccurate or ungrounded information \\cite{luo2023xyc}.\n    *   This problem is important because it significantly hinders LLMs' reliability and trustworthiness, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare.\n    *   It is challenging because existing methods primarily focus on *post-detection* of hallucinations, lacking the ability to *prevent* their occurrence. These methods also suffer from interpretability issues, inconsistent performance due to instruction format and model style, and often rely on external knowledge bases or strong inference abilities from the LLM itself \\cite{luo2023xyc}. A proactive, preventative, and zero-resource strategy is needed.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   Existing approaches for hallucination detection and correction in open conversations fall into two main categories:\n        *   **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) or prompt programming methods**: These evaluate and amend responses, sometimes with external knowledge bases. Limitations include being engineered for specific responses, high dependence on the model's inner inference ability, and ambiguous classification thresholds due to free-text outputs \\cite{luo2023xyc}.\n        *   **Parameter-based methods**: These use metrics like token probability or perplexity to determine hallucination levels. While offering better generalization and precise scores, they often reduce interpretability and may be limited to specific domains (e.g., biography-related issues for Self-check GPT) \\cite{luo2023xyc}.\n    *   All these methods are primarily *post-detection*, meaning they identify hallucinations after generation, rather than preventing them. They also often rely on external knowledge or are sensitive to instruction/model styles.\n    *   This work positions `SELF-FAMILIARITY` \\cite{luo2023xyc} as a novel *pre-detection*, *zero-resource* method that analyzes the input instruction itself to prevent hallucinations, distinguishing it from prior art.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   The core technical method is `SELF-FAMILIARITY` \\cite{luo2023xyc}, a pre-detection self-evaluation technique that mimics human self-assessment by evaluating the LLM's familiarity with concepts in the input instruction. If unfamiliar concepts are detected, the model refrains from generating a response.\n    *   The approach consists of three main stages:\n        1.  **Concept Extraction**: Uses a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to extract key concept entities from the input instruction. It refines these by \"Concept Grouping\" (fusing adjacent concepts) and \"Concept Filtering\" (removing common concepts using Wiktionary) to reduce noise and improve efficiency \\cite{luo2023xyc}.\n        2.  **Concept Guessing**: For each extracted concept, the model performs a self-evaluation to determine its familiarity. This involves:\n            *   **Concept Explanation**: The LLM generates an explanation for the concept using greedy search. To prevent \"cheating,\" the original concept's words are masked within the generated explanation \\cite{luo2023xyc}.\n            *   **Concept Inference**: Using the masked explanation, the LLM is prompted to regenerate the original concept. Constrained beam search is employed to ensure the original concept is sought, and the highest probability score of the successful regeneration is taken as the \"familiarity score\" for that concept \\cite{luo2023xyc}.\n        3.  **Aggregation**: Combines individual concept familiarity scores into a single instruction-level familiarity score. This involves calculating a \"Concept Frequency Score\" (based on word frequency ranks from Wiktionary) to weigh the importance of each concept, followed by a \"Weighted Aggregation\" using a geometrically decreasing scheme. If the final score falls below a predetermined threshold, the response generation is withheld \\cite{luo2023xyc}.\n    *   This approach is novel because it is proactive (pre-detection), zero-resource (no external knowledge base needed), and uses prompt engineering to derive a quantitative familiarity score without requiring strong inference abilities or producing ambiguous free-text outputs \\cite{luo2023xyc}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithm/Method**: Introduction of `SELF-FAMILIARITY` \\cite{luo2023xyc}, a pre-detection self-evaluation framework for hallucination prevention in LLMs.\n    *   **Innovative Techniques**:\n        *   A multi-stage concept processing pipeline (NER, grouping, filtering) for robust concept extraction from free-text instructions.\n        *   The \"Concept Guessing\" mechanism, which uses a two-step prompt engineering process (explanation generation with masking, followed by constrained beam search for inference) to quantitatively assess an LLM's familiarity with a concept.\n        *   A weighted aggregation scheme for instruction-level familiarity, incorporating concept importance via frequency scores.\n    *   **System Design**: A zero-resource approach that operates solely on the LLM's intrinsic knowledge, enhancing universality and applicability \\cite{luo2023xyc}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insight**: Emulation of human self-assessment to refrain from responding to unfamiliar topics, providing a more intuitive and interpretable mechanism for hallucination mitigation.\n    *   **Dataset Contribution**: Introduction of the Concept-7 dataset, specifically designed for validating pre-detection hallucinatory instruction classification, addressing a gap in existing post-detection datasets \\cite{luo2023xyc}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   The `SELF-FAMILIARITY` method \\cite{luo2023xyc} was validated across four different large language models.\n    *   Experiments were conducted using a newly proposed dataset, Concept-7, which focuses on the classification of potential hallucinatory instructions.\n    *   The results consistently demonstrated superior performance of `SELF-FAMILIARITY` \\cite{luo2023xyc} compared to existing techniques across all tested models.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**: While the paper highlights its strengths, the effectiveness of `SELF-FAMILIARITY` \\cite{luo2023xyc} relies on the accuracy of the initial NER model for concept extraction and the robustness of the prompt engineering for concept explanation and inference. The paper addresses some of these (grouping, filtering, masking), but these remain dependencies. The final threshold `h` for withholding responses needs to be predetermined, which might require careful tuning.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The method is designed for a *zero-resource* environment and targets *pre-detection* of hallucinations in *open conversation* settings, making it broadly applicable where external knowledge bases are unavailable or real-time prevention is crucial \\cite{luo2023xyc}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   This work represents a significant advancement by shifting the paradigm from post-detection to *preemptive prevention* of LLM hallucinations \\cite{luo2023xyc}.\n    *   It enhances the reliability, applicability, and interpretability of LLM assistants by enabling them to \"know what they don't know\" and refrain from generating potentially inaccurate information.\n    *   The zero-resource nature and robustness against instruction/model styles make it highly practical for diverse real-world applications.

        "title": "FreshLLMs: Refreshing Large Language Models with Search Engine Augmentation",
        "abstract": "Most large language models (LLMs) are trained once and never updated; thus, they lack the ability to dynamically adapt to our ever-changing world. In this work, we perform a detailed study of the factuality of LLM-generated text in the context of answering questions that test current world knowledge. Specifically, we introduce FreshQA, a novel dynamic QA benchmark encompassing a diverse range of question and answer types, including questions that require fast-changing world knowledge as well as questions with false premises that need to be debunked. We benchmark a diverse array of both closed and open-source LLMs under a two-mode evaluation procedure that allows us to measure both correctness and hallucination. Through human evaluations involving more than 50K judgments, we shed light on limitations of these models and demonstrate significant room for improvement: for instance, all models (regardless of model size) struggle on questions that involve fast-changing knowledge and false premises. Motivated by these results, we present FreshPrompt, a simple few-shot prompting method that substantially boosts the performance of an LLM on FreshQA by incorporating relevant and up-to-date information retrieved from a search engine into the prompt. Our experiments show that FreshPrompt outperforms both competing search engine-augmented prompting methods such as Self-Ask (Press et al., 2022) as well as commercial systems such as Perplexity.AI. Further analysis of FreshPrompt reveals that both the number of retrieved evidences and their order play a key role in influencing the correctness of LLM-generated answers. Additionally, instructing the LLM to generate concise and direct answers helps reduce hallucination compared to encouraging more verbose answers. To facilitate future work, we release FreshQA at github.com/freshllms/freshqa and commit to updating it at regular intervals.",

Furthermore, it has been unclear how to fully leverage search engine outputs to maximize LLM factuality, a gap this work aims to address by outperforming competing search-augmented prompting methods like SELF-ASK \\cite{vu202337s}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**:\n        *   **FRESH QA Benchmark**: A novel, dynamic QA benchmark comprising 600 questions designed to test current world knowledge. Questions are categorized into never-changing, slow-changing, fast-changing, and false-premise types, with a commitment to regular updates \\cite{vu202337s}.\n        *   **Two-Mode Evaluation**: A rigorous human evaluation procedure (50K+ judgments) with two modes: RELAXED (measures primary answer correctness) and STRICT (measures if *all* claims are factual and up-to-date, capturing hallucination) \\cite{vu202337s}.\n        *   **FRESH PROMPT**: A simple, few-shot in-context learning method that significantly boosts LLM factuality. It incorporates relevant and up-to-date information retrieved from a search engine directly into the LLM's prompt. This includes extracting diverse information, such as knowledge from \"relevant questions that search users also ask,\" and presenting retrieved evidences in chronological order \\cite{vu202337s}.\n    *   **Novelty/Differentiation**:\n        *   The creation of FRESH QA as a dynamic, regularly updated benchmark specifically targeting fast-changing and false-premise knowledge, which are known LLM weaknesses \\cite{vu202337s}.\n        *   The comprehensive two-mode evaluation (RELAXED vs. STRICT) provides a nuanced understanding of LLM factuality and hallucination \\cite{vu202337s}.\n        *   FRESH PROMPT's innovative approach to effectively integrate a broad range of search engine outputs and leverage few-shot in-context learning to teach models to reason over retrieved evidence, without requiring additional training \\cite{vu202337s}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms, Methods, or Techniques**:\n        *   **FRESH QA**: A dynamic, diverse, and regularly updated QA benchmark for evaluating LLM factuality on current and evolving knowledge, including challenging false-premise questions \\cite{vu202337s}.\n        *   **FRESH PROMPT**: An effective, training-free few-shot prompting method that significantly enhances LLM factuality by intelligently integrating search engine results into the prompt \\cite{vu202337s}.\n        *   **Two-mode Evaluation (RELAXED/STRICT)**: A robust protocol for comprehensive assessment of LLM correctness and hallucination \\cite{vu202337s}.\n        *   **FRESH EVAL**: A simple automatic metric for evaluating model responses, achieving high agreement with human judgments \\cite{vu202337s}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights or Analysis**: Analysis of FRESH PROMPT demonstrates that both the number and chronological order of retrieved evidences are crucial for performance, and that encouraging concise answers helps reduce hallucination \\cite{vu202337s}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**:\n        *   Benchmarking of a diverse array of closed and open-source LLMs (e.g., T5, PaLM, FLAN-PaLM, GPT-3.5, ChatGPT, GPT-4) on FRESH QA using zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought (COT) prompting \\cite{vu202337s}.\n        *   Extensive human evaluations (over 50K judgments) using the RELAXED and STRICT modes \\cite{vu202337s}.\n        *   Comparison of FRESH PROMPT against competing search-augmented prompting methods (e.g., SELF-ASK) and commercial systems (e.g., PERPLEXITY.AI) \\cite{vu202337s}.\n        *   Sensitivity and ablation analyses to understand the impact of various facets of FRESH PROMPT (e.g., number and order of evidences, answer verbosity) \\cite{vu202337s}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   Baseline LLMs showed low overall accuracy on FRESH QA (0.8% to 32.0% under STRICT, 0.8% to 46.4% under RELAXED), with \"flat scaling curves\" on fast-changing and false-premise questions, indicating that increasing model size alone does not reliably improve performance in these areas \\cite{vu202337s}.\n        *   COT prompting was found to increase hallucination compared to few-shot prompting under STRICT evaluation \\cite{vu202337s}.\n        *   FRESH PROMPT significantly boosted LLM factuality: for instance, the best GPT-4 + FRESH PROMPT variant achieved a 32.6% improvement in RELAXED accuracy and a 49.0% improvement in STRICT accuracy over vanilla GPT-4 on FRESH QA \\cite{vu202337s}.\n        *   FRESH PROMPT consistently outperformed competing search-augmented methods like SELF-ASK and commercial systems such as PERPLEXITY.AI \\cite{vu202337s}.\n        *   Human evaluation inter-rater agreement was high (99% for RELAXED, 96% for STRICT), and the automatic metric FRESH EVAL achieved 96.5% and 96% agreement with human evaluations for RELAXED and STRICT, respectively \\cite{vu202337s}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The study confirms that LLMs without real-time data access inherently struggle with current information and false premises \\cite{vu202337s}. Chain-of-Thought (COT) prompting, while sometimes beneficial, can introduce more hallucination under strict factuality evaluations \\cite{vu202337s}. Multi-hop reasoning remains challenging for several models \\cite{vu202337s}. FRESH PROMPT's effectiveness relies on the quality and relevance of the retrieved search engine results \\cite{vu202337s}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The work focuses on question-answering tasks requiring up-to-date world knowledge. FRESH QA questions are designed to be natural and plausible for real-world search queries. The dataset excludes questions whose answers change more frequently than once per week \\cite{vu202337s}.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: This paper significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing a robust, dynamic benchmark (FRESH QA) and a comprehensive evaluation methodology for LLM factuality on evolving knowledge \\cite{vu202337s}. FRESH PROMPT offers a highly effective, training-free, and flexible method to dramatically improve LLM factuality by intelligently integrating search engine augmentation, outperforming existing methods \\cite{vu202337s}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: The release of FRESH QA and the commitment to its regular updates will serve as a crucial resource, driving future research into dynamic knowledge integration, factuality, and hallucination mitigation for LLMs \\cite{vu202337s}. The findings regarding the limitations of scaling laws and the increased hallucination with COT prompting provide critical insights for the design and development of more reliable LLMs \\cite{vu202337s}.",

        "abstract": "Despite recent advances in abstractive summarization, current summarization systems still suffer from content hallucinations where models generate text that is either irrelevant or contradictory to the source document. However, prior work has been predicated on the assumption that any generated facts not appearing explicitly in the source are undesired hallucinations. Methods have been proposed to address this scenario by ultimately improving `faithfulness' to the source document, but in reality, there is a large portion of entities in the gold reference targets that are not directly in the source. In this work, we show that these entities are not aberrations, but they instead require utilizing external world knowledge to infer reasoning paths from entities in the source. We show that by utilizing an external knowledge base, we can improve the faithfulness of summaries without simply making them more extractive, and additionally, we show that external knowledge bases linked from the source can benefit the factuality of generated summaries.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Current abstractive summarization models frequently suffer from content hallucinations, generating text that is irrelevant or contradictory to the source document \\cite{dong20223yz}.\n    *   **Nuance**: Prior work often assumes any generated facts not explicitly in the source are undesired hallucinations, leading to methods focused solely on \"faithfulness\" to the source document \\cite{dong20223yz}. However, a significant portion of entities in gold reference summaries are not directly in the source but are factually correct and require external world knowledge for comprehension \\cite{dong20223yz}.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge**: Factual errors, particularly entity-based ones, are highly prevalent (e.g., 92% of XSUM summaries contain at least one factual error) and undermine the trustworthiness and utility of generated summaries \\cite{dong20223yz}. The challenge lies in enabling models to leverage external, abstractive knowledge to produce factually consistent summaries without simply making them more extractive \\cite{dong20223yz}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Almost all prior work considers out-of-article entities generated by models as factually incorrect, focusing on improving factual consistency by filtering training examples to contain only extractive entities or by enforcing strict source faithfulness \\cite{dong20223yz}.\n    *   **Positioning**: This work challenges the prevailing assumption by demonstrating that a large portion of out-of-article entities in gold references are factually correct and supported by external world knowledge \\cite{dong20223yz}. It positions itself as improving faithfulness from an *abstractive perspective* by providing additional, relevant facts, rather than solely focusing on extractiveness \\cite{dong20223yz}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper explores two main methods to incorporate external knowledge:\n        1.  **Direct Fact Concatenation**: Linearizing facts from a knowledge subgraph (constructed by identifying one-hop Wikidata links from entities in the source document) and appending them to the source input of a T5-3B sequence-to-sequence model \\cite{dong20223yz}.\n        2.  **Fact-based Revision Model (Generate-and-Revise)**: A two-stage pipeline:\n            *   An initial T5-3B model generates a summary \\cite{dong20223yz}.\n            *   An entity linker identifies and masks entities in the generated summary, creating a \"skeleton summary\" \\cite{dong20223yz}.\n            *   A **Fact Injected Language Model (FILM)** \\cite{dong20223yz} then revises and corrects the masked entities by predicting new ones, leveraging a separate \"fact memory\" that stores millions of facts and learns to retrieve relevant subsets \\cite{dong20223yz}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   **Redefining Faithfulness**: Introduces a dual concept of faithfulness: to the source document (extractiveness) and to external world knowledge (abstractiveness) \\cite{dong20223yz}.\n        *   **Knowledge Subgraph Construction**: Systematically builds a one-hop knowledge subgraph from Wikidata, linked from source entities, to provide relevant external facts \\cite{dong20223yz}.\n        *   **FILM for Revision**: The use of FILM is a key innovation, addressing the scalability issues of direct concatenation by storing facts in a separate memory and learning to retrieve them, rather than appending them to the input \\cite{dong20223yz}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Empirical Study on Knowledge Gaps**: Provides a comprehensive study showing that 60-79% of target entities in XSUM are out-of-article, and a significant portion (20.6-57.1% improvement in coverage) can be found in a one-hop knowledge subgraph linked from source entities \\cite{dong20223yz}.\n    *   **Methods for Knowledge Integration**: Proposes and evaluates two distinct methods for incorporating external knowledge into abstractive summarization models: direct concatenation and a novel generate-and-revise pipeline using a fact-aware model (FILM) \\cite{dong20223yz}.\n    *   **System Design for Entity Correction**: The two-stage revision architecture, particularly the integration of FILM for targeted entity correction, offers a robust approach to mitigating entity-based hallucinations \\cite{dong20223yz}.\n    *   **Novel Evaluation Metrics**: Introduces entity-based metrics (entity correctness and entity consistency) that match predicted entities to target/source/KB entities via Wikidata IDs, enabling a more accurate evaluation of factual consistency that accounts for abstractive, factually correct entities \\cite{dong20223yz}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**:\n        *   A case study analyzed entity coverage in gold reference summaries of XSUM and an abstractive subset of CNN/Daily Mail (CNNDM abs) by linking source entities to Wikidata \\cite{dong20223yz}.\n        *   Experiments evaluated the direct fact concatenation method using a T5-3B model on XSUM, comparing performance with source-only input, random word concatenation, and random fact concatenation \\cite{dong20223yz}.\n        *   The fact-based revision model (FILM) was evaluated for entity correction, including oracle correction on gold-reference summaries and revision of system-generated summaries \\cite{dong20223yz}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**:\n        *   Standard ROUGE scores (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-L) for summary quality \\cite{dong20223yz}.\n        *   FactCC for factual consistency \\cite{dong20223yz}.\n        *   Novel entity-based metrics: \"entity correctness\" (matching predicted to target entities by ID) and \"entity consistency\" (matching predicted to source/KB entities by ID) \\cite{dong20223yz}.\n    *   **Comparison Results (from provided text)**:\n        *   The case study showed that including a one-hop knowledge subgraph significantly increased target entity coverage (e.g., 20.6-57.1% improvement over source-only entities), with diminishing returns for additional hops \\cite{dong20223yz}.\n        *   Directly appending linked location facts to the source input improved both ROUGE and FactCC scores compared to source-only input or appending random information \\cite{dong20223yz}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**:\n        *   **Scalability of Concatenation**: Direct concatenation of knowledge subgraph facts is limited by the input length constraints of Transformer models (e.g., 1024 tokens for T5), making it impractical for large KBs or many entity types \\cite{dong20223yz}.\n        *   **KB Incompleteness & Temporal Misalignment**: The underlying Wikidata KB is incomplete, leading to uncovered target entities. It can also suffer from temporal misalignment, providing outdated facts for news articles \\cite{dong20223yz}.\n        *   **Limited KB Traversal**: The current approach primarily uses one-hop facts, which may not capture all necessary multi-hop reasoning paths \\cite{dong20223yz}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The methods primarily focus on mitigating entity-based hallucinations using structured external knowledge. While effective for entities, they may not directly address other types of factual errors or non-entity-based inconsistencies \\cite{dong20223yz}.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancing State-of-the-Art**: This work significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by redefining \"faithfulness\" in abstractive summarization to include external world knowledge, moving beyond a purely extractive paradigm \\cite{dong20223yz}. It demonstrates a viable path to generating more abstractive yet factually consistent summaries.\n    *   **Novel Hallucination Mitigation Paradigm**: It introduces a novel and effective paradigm for mitigating entity-based hallucinations through explicit knowledge base integration, particularly via the innovative generate-and-revise framework with the FILM model \\cite{dong20223yz}.\n    *   **Improved Evaluation Framework**: The introduction of entity-based evaluation metrics that account for abstractive but factually correct entities provides a more nuanced and accurate way to assess factual consistency, which is crucial for guiding future research and development in abstractive summarization \\cite{dong20223yz}.\n    *   **Potential Impact**: This research opens new avenues for exploring more sophisticated knowledge integration techniques, dynamic KB construction, and multi-hop reasoning in summarization, paving the way for more robust and human-like abstractive systems \\cite{dong20223yz}.",

        "abstract": "Large pretrained generative models like GPT-3 often suffer from hallucinating non-existent or incorrect content, which undermines their potential merits in real applications. Existing work usually attempts to detect these hallucinations based on a corresponding oracle reference at a sentence or document level. However ground-truth references may not be readily available for many free-form text generation applications, and sentence- or document-level detection may fail to provide the fine-grained signals that would prevent fallacious content in real time. As a first step to addressing these issues, we propose a novel token-level, reference-free hallucination detection task and an associated annotated dataset named HaDeS (HAllucination DEtection dataSet). To create this dataset, we first perturb a large number of text segments extracted from English language Wikipedia, and then verify these with crowd-sourced annotations. To mitigate label imbalance during annotation, we utilize an iterative model-in-loop strategy. We conduct comprehensive data analyses and create multiple baseline models.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, although their susceptibility to hallucination poses significant challenges for their deployment in critical areas such as healthcare. To address this issue, retrieving relevant facts from knowledge graphs (KGs) is considered a promising method. Existing KG-augmented approaches tend to be resource-intensive, requiring multiple rounds of retrieval and verification for each factoid, which impedes their application in real-world scenarios. In this study, we propose Self-Refinement-Enhanced Knowledge Graph Retrieval (Re-KGR) to augment the factuality of LLMs' responses with less retrieval efforts in the medical field. Our approach leverages the attribution of next-token predictive probability distributions across different tokens, and various model layers to primarily identify tokens with a high potential for hallucination, reducing verification rounds by refining knowledge triples associated with these tokens. Moreover, we rectify inaccurate content using retrieved knowledge in the post-processing stage, which improves the truthfulness of generated responses. Experimental results on a medical dataset demonstrate that our approach can enhance the factual capability of LLMs across various foundational models as evidenced by the highest scores on truthfulness.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review, adhering to your citation requirements and bullet format:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly susceptible to \"hallucinations,\" generating responses that do not align with real-world facts. This is a critical challenge, especially in high-risk domains like healthcare, where non-factual information can lead to severe consequences \\cite{niu2024v97}.\n    *   Existing Knowledge Graph (KG)-augmented approaches to mitigate hallucinations are often resource-intensive, requiring multiple rounds of retrieval and verification for every factual statement. This high computational cost impedes their practical application \\cite{niu2024v97}.\n    *   The problem is challenging because LLMs may lack domain-specific or up-to-date knowledge, struggle to adapt to specialized domains, or have limited capacity, making hallucinations inevitable without external intervention \\cite{niu2024v97}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Positioning**: \\cite{niu2024v97} positions its work, Self-Refinement-Enhanced Knowledge Graph Retrieval (Re-KGR), as an efficient post-generation hallucination mitigation method specifically targeting \"fact inconsistency\" hallucinations in medical Question-Answering (QA) tasks.\n    *   **Relation to existing approaches**: It builds upon Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and post-processing techniques but aims to overcome their inefficiencies. It draws inspiration from prior work on hallucination identification that analyzes next-token predictive probability distributions (e.g., entropy, max value) and internal LLM states (e.g., distribution divergence between layers, as in DoLa \\cite{niu2024v97} citing [10]).\n    *   **Limitations of previous solutions**: Prior RAG and post-processing methods (e.g., NPH, RHO, KGR) often incur substantial computational costs, require supervised training for specific models, or entail laborious retrieval efforts by verifying *all* factual statements in a response. They lack an efficient mechanism to identify *which* parts of a response are likely to be erroneous, leading to redundant verification \\cite{niu2024v97}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method (Re-KGR)**: \\cite{niu2024v97} proposes a \"refine-then-retrieval\" paradigm for injecting external knowledge in the post-generation stage, designed to reduce hallucination with minimal retrieval efforts. The approach consists of four main components:\n        1.  **Entity Detection**: Identifies word entities with a high potential for hallucination by analyzing the predictive uncertainties of token logits. This involves quantifying uncertainty using the max value and entropy of the next-token predictive probability distribution, and measuring distribution divergence between the final and intermediate layers (using Jensen-Shannon divergence, inspired by DoLa \\cite{niu2024v97} citing [10]). Abnormal values are detected via quartile-based assessment.\n        2.  **Triple Extraction**: Prompts the LLM to extract all factual statements as knowledge triples from its generated response. Crucially, this set is *refined* by retaining only those triples that include the previously identified high-risk word entities, thereby reducing the number of retrieval instances.\n        3.  **KG Retrieval**: Retrieves associated knowledge triples from a domain-specific medical Knowledge Graph. This process enhances recall by expanding the refined triple set with synonyms for entities and predicates.\n        4.  **Knowledge Verification & Rectification**: Compares the refined factual triples from the LLM's response with the retrieved KG knowledge to verify truthfulness and subsequently rectifies inaccurate content in the original response.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   **Selective Retrieval**: Unlike prior methods that retrieve and verify *all* factual statements, Re-KGR proactively identifies and targets only *high-risk* factual statements/entities for KG retrieval, significantly reducing verification rounds and computational overhead \\cite{niu2024v97}.\n        *   **Self-Refinement based on Internal States**: It leverages the LLM's internal next-token predictive probability distributions and layer-wise divergence to \"self-refine\" the scope of knowledge retrieval, indicating that LLMs can implicitly signal their own uncertainties \\cite{niu2024v97}.\n        *   **Post-generation, Pre-verification Refinement**: Integrates a refinement step *after* initial generation but *before* extensive KG verification, optimizing the retrieval process.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Method**: Introduction of Self-Refinement-Enhanced Knowledge Graph Retrieval (Re-KGR), a novel \"refine-then-retrieval\" paradigm for efficient hallucination mitigation in LLMs \\cite{niu2024v97}.\n    *   **Efficient Hallucination Identification**: A method for identifying hallucination-prone tokens/entities by analyzing next-token predictive probability distributions and layer-wise distribution divergence, enabling targeted knowledge retrieval \\cite{niu2024v97}.\n    *   **Targeted Knowledge Retrieval**: A mechanism to significantly reduce KG retrieval efforts by refining the set of factual statements to be verified, focusing only on those associated with identified high-risk entities \\cite{niu2024v97}.\n    *   **System Design**: Integration of internal LLM uncertainty signals with external KG retrieval in a post-generation, self-refinement framework \\cite{niu2024v97}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: The Re-KGR method was evaluated on medical question-answering tasks \\cite{niu2024v97}.\n    *   **Foundational Models**: Experiments were conducted using LLaMA \\cite{niu2024v97} (a widely-used LLM) and integrated with DoLa \\cite{niu2024v97} citing [10], a state-of-the-art contrastive decoding technique.\n    *   **Dataset & KG**: A medical dataset (MedQuAD) was used, and an expansive domain-specific knowledge graph was constructed upon an existing corpus of medical information \\cite{niu2024v97}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Results**:\n        *   **Truthfulness/Accuracy**: Experimental results demonstrated that Re-KGR significantly enhances the factual capability of LLMs' responses, achieving the highest scores on truthfulness across various foundational models \\cite{niu2024v97}.\n        *   **Efficiency**: The method achieved a \"notable reduction in time expenditure\" by minimizing KG-based retrieval efforts, confirming its efficiency claims \\cite{niu2024v97}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The current study focuses specifically on \"fact inconsistency\" hallucinations within medical Question-Answering (QA) tasks. Its direct applicability to other types of hallucinations (e.g., input-conflicting, context-conflicting) or other domains would require further investigation \\cite{niu2024v97}.\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The effectiveness relies on the ability of the LLM's internal states (next-token probabilities, layer divergence) to accurately signal uncertainty and potential hallucinations.

Yet, these models are often plagued by\"hallucinations\", where irrelevant or nonsensical content is generated, deviating from the actual video context. This work introduces VideoHallucer, the first comprehensive benchmark for hallucination detection in large video-language models (LVLMs). VideoHallucer categorizes hallucinations into two main types: intrinsic and extrinsic, offering further subcategories for detailed analysis, including object-relation, temporal, semantic detail, extrinsic factual, and extrinsic non-factual hallucinations. We adopt an adversarial binary VideoQA method for comprehensive evaluation, where pairs of basic and hallucinated questions are crafted strategically. By evaluating eleven LVLMs on VideoHallucer, we reveal that i) the majority of current models exhibit significant issues with hallucinations; ii) while scaling datasets and parameters improves models' ability to detect basic visual cues and counterfactuals, it provides limited benefit for detecting extrinsic factual hallucinations; iii) existing models are more adept at detecting facts than identifying hallucinations.

It offers a clear taxonomy of hallucination symptoms (judgment vs. description; object, attribute, relation), categorizes evaluation methods (non-hallucinatory generation vs. hallucination discrimination), identifies root causes (data bias, model architecture, modality misalignment), and reviews mitigation strategies. This structured analysis helps to clarify a complex and rapidly evolving field.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms, Methods, or Techniques**: The paper does not introduce new algorithms but rather *categorizes and explains* existing ones for hallucination evaluation (e.g., handcrafted pipeline methods like CCEval, model-based end-to-end methods like LLM-based evaluation and hallucination data-driven models, and discrimination methods like POPE).\n    *   **System Design or Architectural Innovations**: Not applicable, as it is a survey.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights or Analysis**: Provides a detailed conceptual clarification of LVLM hallucinations, a multifaceted taxonomy of symptoms, and a thorough analysis of their root causes, encompassing training data issues (bias, irrelevance) and model component limitations (vision encoder grounding, modality misalignment, context attention).\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: The authors of this survey did not conduct new experiments.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**: The paper *reviews* the experimental validation from other research, detailing various benchmarks (e.g., POPE, NOPE, CIEM for discriminative tasks; M-HalDetect, GAVIE, FAITHScore, MMHal-Bench for generative tasks) and metrics used in the field (e.g., Accuracy for object presence, Reward Model Score, FAITHScore, Rating Score for generative faithfulness). It highlights the trend towards more complex metrics for generative benchmarks.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations or Assumptions (of the field, as discussed)**: The survey discusses limitations of existing LVLMs and mitigation methods, such as the resource-intensive nature of training high-resolution visual encoders for hallucination reduction, and the persistent challenge of the significant gap between visual and textual tokens.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The survey's scope is strictly focused on \"hallucination\" within \"Large Vision-Language Models,\" covering its definition, symptoms, evaluation, causes, and mitigation strategies.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advance the Technical State-of-the-Art**: This survey significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing a much-needed, structured, and comprehensive overview of a critical and complex problem in LVLMs. It systematizes existing knowledge, clarifies terminology, and identifies key challenges and open questions.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: By offering a clear conceptual framework, a review of current evaluation practices, an analysis of root causes, and a summary of mitigation strategies, the paper serves as a foundational reference. It is expected to guide future research and development efforts towards building more reliable, faithful, and efficient LVLMs. The accompanying GitHub repository ensures continuous updates, further enhancing its utility.",

        "abstract": "In the era of large language models (LLMs), hallucination (i.e., the tendency to generate factually incorrect content) poses great challenge to trustworthy and reliable deployment of LLMs in real-world applications. To tackle the LLM hallucination, three key questions should be well studied: how to detect hallucinations (detection), why do LLMs hallucinate (source), and what can be done to mitigate them (mitigation). To address these challenges, this work presents a systematic empirical study on LLM hallucination, focused on the the three aspects of hallucination detection, source and mitigation. Specially, we construct a new hallucination benchmark HaluEval 2.0, and designs a simple yet effective detection method for LLM hallucination. Furthermore, we zoom into the different training or utilization stages of LLMs and extensively analyze the potential factors that lead to the LLM hallucination. Finally, we implement and examine a series of widely used techniques to mitigate the hallucinations in LLMs. Our work has led to several important findings to understand the hallucination origin and mitigate the hallucinations in LLMs. Our code and data can be accessed at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/HaluEval-2.0.",

We introduce Recognition-based Object Probing Evaluation (ROPE), an automated evaluation protocol that considers the distribution of object classes within a single image during testing and uses visual referring prompts to eliminate ambiguity. With comprehensive empirical studies and analysis of potential factors leading to multi-object hallucination, we found that (1).

reason about multiple entities.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**:\n        *   Real-world applications (e.g., embodied AI, autonomous driving) require LVLMs to accurately perceive and interact with multiple objects concurrently.\n        *   Evaluating multiple objects simultaneously is more challenging than single-object queries, as models may invent non-existent objects or become

 **Single-Object Focus**: Most prior object hallucination benchmarks (e.g., POPE \\cite{chen2024vy7}, CHAIR \\cite{chen2024vy7}) concentrate on the presence of a single object class or instance, failing to capture multi-object misperceptions.\n        *   **Referential Ambiguity**: Existing methods often rely on textual descriptions for object reference, which can lead to ambiguity,

Method**: The paper introduces **Recognition-based Object Probing Evaluation (ROPE)**, an automated protocol for assessing multi-object hallucination in LVLMs.\n        *   **Visual Referring Prompts**: ROPE leverages visual prompts (e.g., marked bounding boxes) to uniquely refer to specific objects, eliminating ambiguity inherent in textual descriptions.\n        *   **Formatted Output Control**: LVLMs are explicitly instructed to generate a structured output (e.g., `obj1: <class1>, obj2: <class2>`), enabling automated parsing and evaluation without human or black-box model intervention.\n        *   **Multi-Object Query Distributions**: ROPE systematically investigates hallucination across four distinct object class distributions within a single image at test time:\n

objects are of one class, with one object being different (e.g., AAAAB).\n            *   **In-the-Wild**: Randomly chosen and ordered objects.\n        *   **Task Prompt Variations**: To isolate different aspects of model behavior, ROPE defines three multi-object query types and a single-object baseline:\n            *   **Default**: Standard multi-object recognition in a single turn.\n

The evaluation used a dataset constructed from MSCOCO-Panoptic and ADE20K, split into \"Seen\" and \"Unseen\" images.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Results**: The primary metric is the hallucination rate (incorrect object recognition).\n        *   **(1) Increased Hallucination with Multiple Objects**: LVLMs exhibit significantly more hallucinations when tasked with focusing on multiple objects simultaneously compared to single-object queries.\n        *   **(2) Impact of Object Class Distribution**: The distribution of object classes within an image at test time strongly influences hallucination behaviors, suggesting that LVLMs may exploit shortcuts and spurious correlations learned from training data. For instance, models perform better on Homogeneous distributions but struggle with Heterogeneous and Adversarial ones.\n        *   **(3) Influencing Factors**: Hallucinatory behaviors are influenced by data-specific factors (e.g., salience, frequency of objects in training data) and intrinsic model behaviors (e.g., tendency to repeat classes or follow common associations like \"knife and fork\"). Teacher-forcing and Student-forcing prompts helped reveal these underlying tendencies.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Dataset Specificity**: The empirical validation in \\cite{chen2024vy7} uses a dataset with a fixed number of objects (n=5) to be recognized and a predefined set of candidate object classes (N=50). While the ROPE protocol is general, the specific findings are tied to this experimental setup.\n    *   **Focus on Recognition**: ROPE primarily evaluates object *recognition* and classification, rather than complex reasoning or relational understanding between multiple objects, though it provides a foundation for such extensions.\n    *   **Visual Prompt Format**: The current implementation uses bounding boxes as visual prompts; other forms of visual cues (e.g., segmentation masks, points) could be explored.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art**: \\cite{chen2024vy7} significantly advances the understanding and evaluation of object hallucination by shifting focus to the more challenging and realistic multi-object scenario. It provides a robust, automated, and unambiguous protocol (ROPE) for this purpose.\n    *   **Insights into LVLM Behavior**: The findings offer critical insights into why LVLMs hallucinate in multi-object contexts, highlighting the role of object class distributions, data biases, and model intrinsic behaviors (e.g., shortcut learning, spurious correlations).\n    *   **Impact on Future Research**: This work lays the groundwork for:\n        *   Developing more robust LVLMs capable of accurate multi-object recognition and reasoning.\n        *   Guiding the creation of more balanced and diverse training datasets.\n        *   Informing the design of enhanced multi-object instructions and grounding mechanisms in LVLMs.\n        *   Quantifying progress in mitigating a critical failure mode of LVLMs, moving towards more reliable and trustworthy AI systems.",

To address this issue, previous works focused on using specially curated datasets or powerful LLMs to rectify the outputs of LVLMs. However, these approaches require either costly training or fine-tuning, or API access to proprietary LLMs for post-generation correction. In response to these limitations, we propose Mitigating hallucinAtion via image-gRounded guIdaNcE (MARINE), a framework that is both training-free and API-free. MARINE effectively and efficiently reduces object hallucinations during inference by introducing image-grounded guidance to LVLMs. This is achieved by leveraging open-source vision models to extract object-level information, thereby enhancing the precision of LVLM-generated content. Our framework's flexibility further allows for the integration of multiple vision models, enabling more reliable and robust object-level guidance. Through comprehensive evaluations across 5 popular LVLMs with diverse evaluation metrics and benchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MARINE, which even outperforms existing fine-tuning-based methods. Remarkably, it reduces hallucinations consistently in GPT-4V-assisted evaluation while maintaining the detailedness of LVLMs' generations.

This information is aggregated (potentially by a small language model or rule-based algorithm) and translated into a textual \"guidance prompt\" (e.g., \"focusing on the visible objects in this image: [aggregated object info]\").\n        2.  **Guided Text Generation**: Integrates this guidance prompt (`c`) into the LVLM's generation process using a classifier-free guidance mechanism in the logit space.

Here, `p_conditional` is the generation conditioned on the original visual tokens, textual prompt, *and* the guidance prompt `c`, while `p_unconditional` is conditioned only on the original visual tokens and textual prompt.\n    *   **Novelty & Differentiation**:\n        *   **Training-Free & API-Free**: Unlike most prior work, MARINE requires no additional training or fine-tuning of the LVLM and no access to proprietary LLM APIs.\n        *   **Addresses Intrinsic Causes**: Directly tackles hallucination arising from insufficient visual context and information distortion by enriching the visual input with fine-grained, externally derived object information.\n        *   **Flexible Integration**: Allows for the integration and aggregation of multiple open-source vision models, enhancing robustness and reliability.\n        *   **Inference-Time Control**: Applies guidance directly during the decoding process, offering real-time control over generation.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Framework (MARINE)**: A universal, training-free, and API-free framework for mitigating object hallucination in LVLMs.\n    *   **Image-Grounded Guidance Mechanism**: Introduces a method to leverage external, specialized vision models to provide detailed object-level information, which is then converted into textual guidance.\n    *   **Logit-Space Guidance for LVLMs**: Adapts classifier-free guidance to the multi-modal context of LVLMs, allowing for controllable generation by balancing original LVLM output with image-grounded guidance.\n    *   **Aggregation of Multiple Vision Models**: Demonstrates the ability to aggregate information from diverse vision models (e.g., DETR, RAM++) for more robust guidance.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Comprehensive evaluations were performed across 5 popular LVLMs (LLaVA, LLaVA-v1.5, MiniGPT-v2, mPLUG-Owl2, InstructBLIP) using guidance from DETR and RAM++.\n    *   **Benchmarks & Metrics**:\n        *   **Image Captioning**: CHAIR-I (instance-level hallucination), CHAIR-S (sentence-level hallucination), and Recall (inclusion of existing objects) on MSCOCO.\n        *   **Visual Question Answering (VQA)**: POPE (Polling-based Object Probing Evaluation) in adversarial settings (accuracy, F1, \"yes\" answer proportion) on LLaVA-QA90, A-OKVQA, and GQA.\n        *   **Qualitative Evaluation**: GPT-4V-aided evaluation for overall quality and hallucination assessment.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results**:\n        *   **Hallucination Reduction**: MARINE consistently and significantly reduces object hallucinations across all evaluated LVLMs and benchmarks, as measured by CHAIR-I, CHAIR-S, and POPE.\n        *   **Outperforms Baselines**: Achieves superior hallucination mitigation compared to state-of-the-art methods, including existing fine-tuning-based approaches.\n        *   **Maintains Detailedness**: While reducing hallucination, MARINE effectively maintains the detailedness and overall performance of LVLMs' generations (e.g., high Recall scores).\n        *   **Efficiency**: Provides a favorable trade-off between latency and accuracy, demonstrating the lowest computational overhead compared to existing baselines, making it a practical and scalable solution.\n        *   **GPT-4V Evaluation**: Consistently reduces hallucinations in GPT-4V-assisted evaluations.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**: While addressing visual encoder and cross-modal projection issues, MARINE does not directly tackle \"inherent hallucinations common in general language models\" (i.e., language-prior-driven hallucinations).

This limitation highlights a critical weakness in current LALMs: their inadequate understanding of discriminative queries. Moreover, we explore the potential of prompt engineering to enhance LALMs' performance on discriminative questions.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review:\n\n### Technical Paper Analysis: Understanding Sounds, Missing the Questions: The Challenge of Object Hallucination in Large Audio-Language Models \\cite{kuan20249pm}\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific technical problem**: The paper addresses the issue of \"object hallucination\" in Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs), where models generate or affirm the presence of objects in audio that are not actually there.\n    *   **Why important and challenging**: LALMs integrate audio perception with Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle diverse audio-related tasks. While previous research has focused on task performance, the reliability of LALMs, particularly concerning hallucination, has been largely overlooked. Hallucination is a known problem in LLMs and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), but there was a lack of discussion and benchmarks for LALMs in the audio domain. This unreliability can lead to incorrect information and reduced trustworthiness in practical applications.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to existing approaches**: LALMs build upon traditional LLMs by adding audio perception capabilities. Existing LALM evaluation benchmarks like Dynamic-SUPERB \\cite{kuan20249pm} and AIR-Bench \\cite{kuan20249pm} primarily assess task performance.\n    *   **Limitations of previous solutions**: These benchmarks do not adequately evaluate the reliability of LALM-generated content, specifically object hallucination. While hallucination has been studied in LLMs and LVLMs (e.g., in image captioning), its prevalence and characteristics in LALMs within speech and audio domains were unexplored, and no specific benchmarks existed to measure it.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core technical method or algorithm**: The paper introduces novel methods to assess object hallucination in LALMs through two main task types:\n        *   **Discriminative Tasks**: Formulated as binary classification (Yes/No) to determine the presence of a specific object's sound. Questions are generated using positive (ground truth) and negative samples (Random, Popular, and Adversarial sampling strategies for non-existent objects). Performance is measured by accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and \"Yes\" answer ratio.\n        *   **Generative Tasks**: Involves audio captioning (e.g., \"Describe the audio\") and noisy Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Nouns are extracted from generated captions using NLP tools (SpaCy \\cite{kuan20249pm}) and compared against ground truth labels to identify hallucinated objects.\n    *   **What makes this approach novel or different**: This is the first work to systematically explore and quantify object hallucination in LALMs. It introduces specific evaluation methodologies and metrics tailored for this problem in the audio domain, including novel negative sampling strategies for discriminative questions and the ECHO (Evaluation of Caption Hallucination in audiO) and Cover metrics for generative tasks. It also explores prompt engineering as a mitigation strategy.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel algorithms, methods, or techniques**:\n        *   Introduction of discriminative and generative evaluation tasks specifically designed to measure object hallucination in LALMs.\n        *   Development of three negative sampling strategies (Random, Popular, Adversarial) for constructing discriminative questions.\n        *   Proposal of ECHO (instance-level ECHO_I and sentence-level ECHO_S) and Cover metrics for quantifying hallucination and coverage in generative audio captioning.\n        *   Investigation into prompt engineering techniques to improve LALM performance on discriminative tasks.\n    *   **Theoretical insights or analysis**: The paper reveals a critical discrepancy: LALMs perform well on audio captioning (generative tasks) but struggle significantly with discriminative questions, indicating a weakness in understanding the *nature* of discriminative queries rather than a fundamental inability to process audio content.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments conducted**:\n        *   Evaluated five publicly available LALMs: Qwen-Audio \\cite{kuan20249pm}, Qwen-Audio-Chat \\cite{kuan20249pm}, LTU-AS-7B \\cite{kuan20249pm}, SALMONN-7B \\cite{kuan20249pm}, and SALMONN-13B \\cite{kuan20249pm}.\n        *   Compared LALMs against a \"Specialized\" cascade pipeline (Whisper-based audio captioning \\cite{kuan20249pm} + ChatGPT \\cite{kuan20249pm} or LLaMA-7b-chat \\cite{kuan20249pm}).\n        *   Used AudioCaps \\cite{kuan20249pm} for audio captioning and CHIME-6 \\cite{kuan20249pm} for noisy ASR.\n        *   Tested five different prompts for both task types and explored greedy vs. sample decoding strategies.\n        *   Investigated eight different prefix prompts for prompt engineering on discriminative tasks.\n    *   **Key performance metrics and comparison results**:\n        *   **Discriminative Tasks**: LALMs exhibited significantly lower recall than precision, indicating a strong tendency to give affirmative answers (hallucinate). F1 scores decreased with more challenging negative sampling strategies (Adversarial < Popular < Random). LALMs were highly sensitive to prompt design. The \"Specialized\" cascade pipeline significantly outperformed all LALMs in F1 scores, highlighting a substantial gap.\n        *   **Generative Tasks**: LALMs' performance on ECHO and Cover metrics was comparable to specialized Whisper-based caption models, demonstrating their capability in understanding audio information and similar levels of object hallucination in captioning. Greedy decoding generally reduced hallucination in generative tasks.\n        *   **Prompt Engineering**: Specific prefix prompts, particularly those emphasizing careful consideration of the question (e.g., P3, P4, P6, P8), led to significant F1 score improvements for some LALMs (e.g., SALMONN models, Qwen-Audio-Chat-7B), but not universally (e.g., LTU-AS-7B showed degradation).\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical limitations or assumptions**: The study primarily focuses on object hallucination and suggests that LALMs' struggle lies in comprehending discriminative queries rather than processing audio content itself. The effectiveness of prompt engineering was model-dependent.\n    *   **Scope of applicability**: The proposed evaluation methods and insights are directly applicable to assessing and improving the reliability of LALMs in audio captioning and related audio understanding tasks.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **How does this advance the technical state-of-the-art**: This work is the first to systematically identify and quantify object hallucination in LALMs, filling a critical gap in LALM reliability research. It introduces novel and comprehensive evaluation methodologies (discriminative/generative tasks, ECHO/Cover metrics) that can serve as benchmarks for future LALM development. It highlights a crucial weakness in current LALMs regarding their understanding of discriminative queries, even when their audio comprehension is strong.\n    *   **Potential impact on future research**: The findings will guide future LALM research towards developing more robust models that are less prone to hallucination, particularly by focusing on improving query understanding mechanisms. It encourages the development of LALMs that can precisely discriminate information from audio, rather than just generating descriptive captions. The proposed evaluation framework provides a valuable tool for assessing the reliability of new LALM architectures.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented performances in various applications, yet evaluating them is still challenging. Existing benchmarks are either manually constructed or are automatic, but lack the ability to evaluate the thought process of LLMs with arbitrary complexity. We contend that utilizing existing relational databases based on the entity-relationship (ER) model is a promising approach for constructing benchmarks as they contain structured knowledge that can be used to question LLMs. Unlike knowledge graphs, which are also used to evaluate LLMs, relational databases have integrity constraints that can be used to better construct complex in-depth questions and verify answers: (1) functional dependencies can be used to pinpoint critical keywords that an LLM must know to properly answer a given question containing certain attribute values; and (2) foreign key constraints can be used to join relations and construct multi-hop questions, which can be arbitrarily long and used to debug intermediate answers. We thus propose ERBench, which uses these integrity constraints to convert any database into an LLM benchmark. ERBench supports continuous evaluation as databases change, multimodal questions, and various prompt engineering techniques. In our experiments, we construct LLM benchmarks using databases of multiple domains and make an extensive comparison of contemporary LLMs. We show how ERBench can properly evaluate any LLM by not only checking for answer correctness, but also effectively verifying the rationales by looking for the right keywords.",

It first introduces LVLM architecture (perceptual, cross-modal, response modules) and identifies the main causes of hallucination:\n        *   **Modality Gap**: Differences in data distribution, features, and semantics between visual and textual modalities, leading to biased understanding.\n        *   **Toxicity in Dataset**: Presence of misleading or hallucinatory samples in large-scale training datasets, often generated by other LLMs/LVLMs.\n        *   **LLM Hallucinations**: Inherited hallucination tendencies from the underlying LLMs used as the \"brain\" of LVLMs, including conflicts with parametric knowledge and randomness in decoding strategies.\n    *   **Novelty/Differentiation**: The primary innovation lies in its novel taxonomic strategy for organizing hallucination correction methods and evaluation benchmarks. Correction methods are categorized into three core ideas:\n        *   **Dataset Dehallucination**: Focuses on improving training data quality.\n        *   **Modalities Gap**: Aims to enhance visual comprehension and bridge the gap between visual and textual representations.\n        *   **Output Correction**: Addresses hallucinations during or after the generation process.\n    *   It also provides a structured overview of evaluation benchmarks, classifying them as \"Judgmental\" or \"Generative.\"\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Taxonomy**: Proposes a novel and comprehensive taxonomy for hallucination correction methods in LVLMs, categorizing them into Dataset Dehallucination, Modalities Gap, and Output Correction.\n    *   **Categorization of Causes**: Clearly identifies and attributes the main technical causes of hallucination in LVLMs to the modality gap, dataset toxicity, and inherent LLM hallucinations.\n    *   **Survey of Evaluation Benchmarks**: Systematically presents available hallucination evaluation benchmarks for LVLMs, distinguishing between judgmental and generative perspectives.\n    *   **Future Research Directions**: Suggests future research avenues to enhance the dependability and utility of LVLMs by addressing the identified challenges.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   The paper itself is a survey and does not conduct new experiments. Instead, it *reviews* the experimental validation strategies employed by the research it summarizes.\n    *   **Types of Experiments/Benchmarks Reviewed**:\n        *   **Judgmental Benchmarks**: Evaluate LVLM responses based on human judgment or specific factual checks. Examples include:\n            *   **Object Hallucination**: POPE \\cite{lan20240yz}, CIEM \\cite{lan20240yz}, EMMA \\cite{lan20240yz}, Merlim \\cite{lan20240yz} (focus on existence, properties, inter-relationships of objects).\n            *   **Parametric Knowledge**: MME \\cite{lan20240yz}, Hallusionbench \\cite{lan20240yz} (assess factual consistency with world knowledge).\n            *   **Self-awareness**: MM-SAP \\cite{lan20240yz}.\n            *   **Special Phenomenon**: VHTest \\cite{lan20240yz}.\n        *   **Generative Benchmarks**: Use automated metrics or specific setups to quantify hallucination in generated text. Examples include:\n            *   **Metrics**: CHAIR \\cite{lan20240yz}, AMBER \\cite{lan20240yz}.\n            *   **Fraudulent Input**: MAD-Bench \\cite{lan20240yz}, CorrelationQA \\cite{lan20240yz}.\n            *   **Visual Drift**: GenCeption \\cite{lan20240yz}.\n            *   **Image Sequences**: Mementos \\cite{lan20240yz}.\n            *   **Reverse Expansion**: UniHD \\cite{lan20240yz}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**: The reviewed papers typically use metrics related to factual accuracy, object existence verification, consistency, and human preference scores to evaluate hallucination mitigation.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations (of LVLMs, as discussed)**: The paper highlights inherent limitations of current LVLMs, such as their reliance on parametric knowledge when visual information is insufficient, the difficulty in bridging the modality gap, and the propagation of biases/hallucinations from training datasets and underlying LLMs.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The survey focuses specifically on hallucination in *Large Visual Language Models*, covering their structure, causes, correction methods, and evaluation. It does not delve into other potential issues of LVLMs or hallucination in other AI model types beyond its direct relevance to LVLMs.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: This survey significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing a much-needed, structured, and comprehensive overview of hallucination in LVLMs. Its novel taxonomy helps organize a rapidly growing field, making it easier for researchers to understand the landscape of existing solutions and identify gaps.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: By clearly outlining the causes, correction strategies, and evaluation methods, the paper serves as a foundational resource. It guides future research by suggesting promising directions for developing more robust, reliable, and trustworthy LVLMs, particularly in areas like improving data quality, enhancing cross-modal understanding, and refining output generation.",

        "abstract": "The ``arms race'' of Large Language Models (LLMs) demands new benchmarks to examine their progresses. In this paper, we introduce GraphArena, a benchmarking tool designed to evaluate LLMs on real-world graph computational problems. It offers a suite of four polynomial-time tasks (e.g., Shortest Distance) and six NP-complete challenges (e.g., Traveling Salesman Problem). GraphArena features a rigorous evaluation framework that classifies LLM outputs as correct, suboptimal (feasible but not optimal), hallucinatory (properly formatted but infeasible), or missing. Evaluation of over 10 LLMs reveals that even top-performing LLMs struggle with larger, more complex graph problems and exhibit hallucination issues. We further explore four potential solutions to address this issue and improve LLMs on graph computation, including chain-of-thought prompting, instruction tuning, code writing, and scaling test-time compute, each demonstrating unique strengths and limitations.

This involves a three-step process:\n            1.  **Path Extraction:** Using regular expressions to extract the proposed solution path.\n            2.  **Feasibility Check:** Script-based verification of whether the extracted path meets basic problem requirements.\n            3.  **Optimality Verification:** Calculation of a path score and comparison against the ground truth optimal

on real-world graph computational problems, encompassing both polynomial-time and NP-complete tasks.\n    *   **Advanced Graph Sampling Methodology:** Employs a random walk with restart strategy to extract topologically representative subgraphs from large real-world datasets, ensuring ecological validity.\n    *   **Multi-dimensional Task Taxonomy:** Categorization of tasks into \"direct algorithmic reasoning\" (polynomial-time) and \"meta-algorithmic planning\" (NP-complete) to probe different facets of LLM intelligence.\n    *   **Fine-grained Evaluation Protocol:** Development of a three-step (Path Extraction, Feasibility Check, Optimality Verification) evaluation framework that moves beyond simple answer matching to assess the correctness, feasibility, and optimality of the

test-time compute as methods to enhance LLM performance on graph reasoning.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:**\n        *   Evaluated over 10 prominent LLMs (including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-sonnet, Llama3, Deepseek-V2) on 10,000 GraphArena problems (500 small, 500 large for each of 10 tasks).\n        *   Compared LLM performance against traditional graph algorithms, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Graph-LLM hybrid approaches.\n        *   Explored four strategies to improve LLM performance: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, instruction tuning, code writing, and increasing test-time compute.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Results:**\n        *   **LLM Performance:** Top-performing LLMs (e.g., Claude-3.5-sonnet, GPT-4o) struggle significantly with larger and more complex graph problems, particularly NP-complete tasks, exhibiting high hallucination rates (e.g., up to 40.7% for GPT-4o-mini on large polynomial tasks).\n        *   **Task Difficulty:** LLMs perform significantly better on polynomial-time tasks (direct algorithmic reasoning) than on NP-complete tasks (meta-algorithmic planning), where they often default to greedy algorithms.\n        *   **Graph Size Impact:** Performance degrades substantially as graph size increases, with hallucination rates rising.\n        *   **Improvement Strategies:**\n

large-scale NP problems.\n            *   **Code Generation:** Demonstrated significant promise for solving large graphs and complex tasks, though some performance degradation was observed on small graphs.\n            *   **Scaling Test-Time Compute:** Yielded modest but consistent performance improvements.\n        *   **Baselines:** The paper notes comparison with traditional algorithms, GNNs, and Graph-LLM hybrids, providing a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' capabilities relative to established methods.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:**\n        *   The benchmark focuses on specific graph computational problems and does not cover all possible graph-related reasoning tasks (e.g., graph generation, graph representation learning).\n        *   The problem encoding into text can result in long contexts (up to 6,000 tokens), which itself poses a challenge for LLMs, potentially conflating long-context understanding with graph reasoning.\n        *   The study conducted a single run per model due to computational demands, which might not capture the full variability of LLM responses.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** GraphArena is primarily applicable for evaluating LLMs' algorithmic reasoning and planning capabilities on discrete graph structures, particularly for problems requiring systematic traversal, search, and optimization. It highlights LLMs' current limitations in handling complex, large-scale graph computations and their tendency to hallucinate infeasible solutions.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** GraphArena significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in LLM evaluation by providing a more realistic, comprehensive, and rigorously evaluated benchmark for graph computational problems. It moves beyond superficial evaluations to probe genuine reasoning and planning abilities.\n    *   **Identification of Key Weaknesses:** The benchmark clearly identifies critical weaknesses in current LLMs, such as their struggle with meta-algorithmic planning, high hallucination rates on complex tasks, and sensitivity to graph size, even for top-tier models.\n    *   **Guidance for Future Research:** The exploration of improvement strategies offers concrete directions for future research, highlighting the potential of code generation and the limitations of simpler prompting techniques and instruction tuning for complex graph reasoning. It also suggests LLMs could serve as alternative heuristics for NP tasks, complementing existing approximation methods.\n    *   **Open-Source Contribution:** The open-sourcing of GraphArena (problems, responses, and codebase) provides a valuable resource for the research community to foster reproducible and comparable advancements in LLM graph reasoning.",

This phenomenon poses significant risks in critical applications, such as medicine or law, necessitating robust hallucination mitigation strategies. While recent works have proposed fine-tuning methods to teach LLMs to abstain from answering questions beyond their knowledge or capabilities, these methods rely on the existence of ground-truth labels or are limited to short-form responses. To address these limitations, we propose fine-tuning using semantic entropy, an uncertainty measure derived from introspection into the model which does not require external labels. We demonstrate that our approach matches or outperforms models fine-tuned using prior work and achieves strong performance for both short and long-form generations on a range of datasets.",

While fine-tuning LLMs to abstain from answering questions beyond their knowledge is a promising mitigation strategy, existing methods suffer from two key limitations:\n        1.  They often rely on the availability of ground-truth labels, which are difficult or costly to obtain and can be noisy.\n        2.  They are typically limited to short-form responses, failing to account for the lexical and syntactical variations inherent in longer generations.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge:** Mitigating hallucinations is crucial for ensuring the safety, trustworthiness, and overall reliability of LLMs, especially as they are increasingly deployed in high-stakes real-world scenarios. Developing a label-free and versatile abstention mechanism applicable to diverse generation lengths is a significant challenge.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** This work builds upon existing hallucination mitigation strategies, particularly those involving uncertainty estimation and abstention fine-tuning.

This makes the uncertainty measure robust to lexical and syntactical variations, allowing it to accurately indicate hallucinations in both short-form and long-form generations. Semantic equivalence is operationalized using question-dependent bi-directional entailment to cluster responses.\n        *   **Label-Free Fine-Tuning:** The method constructs a training dataset by partitioning questions based on their computed semantic entropy. High-entropy questions are assigned an \"abstain\" label (\"I don't know the answer.\"), while low-entropy questions retain the model's standard response. The model is then fine-tuned using supervised learning with cross-entropy loss.\n        *   **Accuracy-Engagement Distance (AED):** A novel evaluation metric is introduced \\cite{tjandra2024umq} that holistically quantifies model hallucination by considering both accuracy and *engagement* (the number of questions a model willingly answers).

Experiments covered two answering settings: Long-QA (free-form) and Short-QA (short answers). The method was compared against R-Tuning (label-dependent) and R-Tuning-U (label-independent, classical entropy) \\cite{zhang2024r}. Semantic entropy was computed using two different entailment models (DeBERTa and Llama-3-70B-Instruct).\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results:**\n        *   The method using semantic entropy (SE) matched or outperformed models fine-tuned with R-Tuning and R-Tuning-U \\cite{tjandra2024umq}.\n        *   It achieved a significant reduction in hallucination rates: up to **30.1% for long-form generations** and up to **8.7% for short-form generations** compared to R-Tuning and R-Tuning-U.\n        *   The AED metric effectively demonstrated the improved balance between accuracy and engagement of the proposed method, penalizing models with low engagement that would otherwise appear equivalent based solely on accuracy.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The effectiveness of semantic entropy relies on the quality and contextual understanding of the underlying entailment model used for semantic clustering. The uncertainty threshold (τ) for partitioning the dataset is a user-defined hyperparameter. Due to resource constraints, LoRA was used for fine-tuning, which might not capture the full potential of full fine-tuning.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The method is demonstrated for factual QA tasks in a closed-book setting.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations, e.g., factually incorrect information, in their responses. These hallucinations present challenges for LLM-based applications that demand high factual accuracy. Existing hallucination detection methods primarily depend on external resources, which can suffer from issues such as low availability, incomplete coverage, privacy concerns, high latency, low reliability, and poor scalability. There are also methods depending on output probabilities, which are often inaccessible for closed-source LLMs like GPT models. This paper presents MetaQA, a self-contained hallucination detection approach that leverages metamorphic relation and prompt mutation. Unlike existing methods, MetaQA operates without any external resources and is compatible with both open-source and closed-source LLMs.\n \n \n \nMetaQA is based on the hypothesis that if an LLM’s response is a hallucination, the designed metamorphic relations will be violated. We compare MetaQA with the state-of-the-art zero-resource hallucination detection method, SelfCheckGPT, across multiple datasets, and on two open-source and two closed-source LLMs. Our results reveal that MetaQA outperforms SelfCheckGPT in terms of precision, recall, and f1 score. For the four LLMs we study, MetaQA outperforms SelfCheckGPT with a superiority margin ranging from 0.041 - 0.113 (for precision), 0.143 - 0.430 (for recall), and 0.154 - 0.368 (for F1-score).

Research Problem & Motivation**\n*   **Specific Technical Problem:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating hallucinations, specifically factually incorrect or irrelevant information, which undermines their reliability in applications demanding high factual accuracy \\cite{yang20251dw}. The paper focuses on detecting \"fact-conflicting hallucinations\" \\cite{yang20251dw}.\n*   **Importance & Challenge:** Hallucinations, especially fact-conflicting ones, can mislead users, erode trust, and have serious consequences (e.g., in legal contexts) \\cite{yang20251dw}.

        "title": "The Need for Guardrails with Large Language Models in Medical Safety-Critical Settings: An Artificial Intelligence Application in the Pharmacovigilance Ecosystem",
        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are useful tools with the capacity for performing specific types of knowledge work at an effective scale. However, LLM deployments in high-risk and safety-critical domains pose unique challenges, notably the issue of ``hallucination,'' where LLMs can generate fabricated information. This is particularly concerning in settings such as drug safety, where inaccuracies could lead to patient harm. To mitigate these risks, we have developed and demonstrated a proof of concept suite of guardrails specifically designed to mitigate certain types of hallucinations and errors for drug safety, and potentially applicable to other medical safety-critical contexts. These guardrails include mechanisms to detect anomalous documents to prevent the ingestion of inappropriate data, identify incorrect drug names or adverse event terms, and convey uncertainty in generated content. We integrated these guardrails with an LLM fine-tuned for a text-to-text task, which involves converting both structured and unstructured data within adverse event reports into natural language. This method was applied to translate individual case safety reports, demonstrating effective application in a pharmacovigilance processing task. Our guardrail framework offers a set of tools with broad applicability across various domains, ensuring LLMs can be safely used in high-risk situations by eliminating the occurrence of key errors, including the generation of incorrect pharmacovigilance-related terms, thus adhering to stringent regulatory and quality standards in medical safety-critical environments.",

The challenge lies in ensuring LLM outputs adhere to stringent regulatory and quality standards, preventing \"never event\" errors (e.g., incorrect drug identification) that are wholly preventable and unacceptable in medical contexts.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: The work positions itself within the broader context of LLM application in biology and medicine, acknowledging their potential but highlighting their inherent limitations, particularly hallucinations and uncertainty communication.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: While \"structural guardrails\" (ensuring consistent output format) exist, the paper focuses on the need for \"semantic guardrails\" to verify the accuracy and content of LLM output. Previous LLM deployments in safety-critical areas often lack robust mechanisms to prevent critical errors or effectively convey uncertainty, making them unsuitable for domains like pharmacovigilance where \"never event\" errors must be absolutely prevented.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes and demonstrates a suite of \"semantic guardrails\" integrated with an LLM fine-tuned for a text-to-text task.

It utilizes custom drug dictionaries and MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) with regular expressions to ensure consistency and prevent hallucination or omission of critical terms.\n        *   **Uncertainty Communication**: The framework includes soft guardrails designed to communicate the model's uncertainty regarding the quality and accuracy of both the input text and its final translation, thereby flagging instances requiring further human review.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: Integration of these guardrails into a sequential processing pipeline for LLM-based ICSR translation, ensuring that potential errors are caught at different stages (input validation, content accuracy).\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: Introduction and operationalization of the concept of \"never event\" errors for LLM outputs in safety-critical domains, emphasizing the need for absolute prevention through robust guardrail mechanisms.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**:\n        *   Fine-tuning and evaluation of three LLMs (mt5-xl, mpt-7b-instruct, stablelm-japanese) on a multilingual corpus of ICSRs and OPUS-100 data for text-to-text translation.\n        *   Expert human evaluation of 210 LLM-generated Japanese-to-English ICSR translations against a \"ground truth\" baseline established by independent bilingual PV experts.\n        *   Application and demonstration of the developed hard and soft semantic guardrails within the ICSR processing pipeline.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results**:\n        *   LLM translation quality was assessed using per-token perplexity, BLEU score, SACRE-BLEU score, and word error rate.\n        *   Human expert evaluation used a detailed five-category assessment system, binary evaluation criteria (presence of any error), and a five-point Likert scale for clinical acceptability.\n        *   The optimal LLM generation hyperparameters were selected based on BLEU score performance (contrastive search with α=0.2 and top-k=16). The guardrails were demonstrated to mitigate identified failure modes and prevent \"never event\" errors, ensuring adherence to safety standards.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The paper focuses primarily on Japanese ICSRs, although the framework is posited to be broadly applicable. The tuning of distance thresholds for the DL-UQ guardrail involves a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, requiring careful calibration for specific applications.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The framework is developed and demonstrated for pharmacovigilance, specifically for the text-to-text conversion and translation of ICSRs.

        "abstract": "Generation of plausible but incorrect factual information, often termed hallucination, has attracted significant research interest. Retrieval-augmented language model (RALM) -- which enhances models with up-to-date knowledge -- emerges as a promising method to reduce hallucination. However, existing RALMs may instead exacerbate hallucination when retrieving lengthy contexts. To address this challenge, we propose COFT, a novel \\textbf{CO}arse-to-\\textbf{F}ine highligh\\textbf{T}ing method to focus on different granularity-level key texts, thereby avoiding getting lost in lengthy contexts. Specifically, COFT consists of three components: \\textit{recaller}, \\textit{scorer}, and \\textit{selector}. First, \\textit{recaller} applies a knowledge graph to extract potential key entities in a given context. Second, \\textit{scorer} measures the importance of each entity by calculating its contextual weight. Finally, \\textit{selector} selects high contextual weight entities with a dynamic threshold algorithm and highlights the corresponding paragraphs, sentences, or words in a coarse-to-fine manner. Extensive experiments on the knowledge hallucination benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of COFT, leading to a superior performance over $30\\%$ in the F1 score metric.

The contextual weight combines these two measures.\n        *   **Selector**: Employs a dynamic threshold algorithm that considers both the length and informativeness of reference contexts to select high contextual weight entities.

        "abstract": "Although Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated exceptional abilities in understanding multimodal data, they invariably suffer from hallucinations, leading to a disconnect between the generated text and the corresponding images. Almost all current visual contrastive decoding methods attempt to mitigate these hallucinations by introducing visual uncertainty information that appropriately widens the contrastive logits gap between hallucinatory and targeted ones. However, due to uncontrollable nature of the global visual uncertainty, they struggle to precisely induce the hallucinatory tokens, which severely limits their effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and may even lead to the generation of undesired hallucinations. To tackle this issue, we conducted the theoretical analysis to promote the effectiveness of contrast decoding. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel optimization strategy named Hallucination-Induced Optimization (HIO). This strategy seeks to amplify the contrast between hallucinatory and targeted tokens relying on a fine-tuned theoretical preference model (i.e., Contrary Bradley-Terry Model), thereby facilitating efficient contrast decoding to alleviate hallucinations in LVLMs. Extensive experimental research demonstrates that our HIO strategy can effectively reduce hallucinations in LVLMs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Mitigating hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) remains an open problem. Recent benchmarks do not address hallucinations in open-ended free-form responses, which we term “Type I hallucinations”. Instead, they focus on hallucinations responding to very specific question formats-typically a multiple-choice response regarding a particular object or attribute-which we term “Type II hallucinations”. Additionally, such benchmarks often require external API calls to models which are subject to change. In practice, we observe that a reduction in Type II hallucinations does not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations but rather that the two forms of halluci-nations are often anti-correlated. To address this, we propose THRONE, a novel object-based automatic framework for quantitatively evaluating Type I hallucinations in LVLM free-form outputs. We use public language models (LMs) to identify hallucinations in LVLM responses and compute informative metrics. By evaluating a large selection of recent LVLMs using public datasets, we show that an improvement in existing metrics do not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations, and that established benchmarks for measuring Type I hallucinations are incomplete. Finally, we provide a simple and effective data augmentation method to reduce Type I and Type II hallucinations as a strong baseline.",

THaMES offers an end-to-end solution for evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in LLMs, featuring automated test set generation, multifaceted benchmarking, and adaptable mitigation strategies.

Current hallucination detection and mitigation datasets are limited in domains and sizes, which struggle to scale due to prohibitive labor costs and insufficient reliability of existing hallucination annotators. To facilitate the scalable oversight of LLM hallucinations, this paper introduces an iterative self-training framework that simultaneously and progressively scales up the hallucination annotation dataset and improves the accuracy of the hallucination annotator. Based on the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, in each iteration, the framework first applies a hallucination annotation pipeline to annotate a scaled dataset and then trains a more accurate hallucination annotator on the dataset. This new hallucination annotator is adopted in the hallucination annotation pipeline used for the next iteration. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the finally obtained hallucination annotator with only 7B parameters surpasses the performance of GPT-4 and obtains new state-of-the-art hallucination detection results on HaluEval and HalluQA by zero-shot inference. Such an annotator can not only evaluate the hallucination levels of various LLMs on the large-scale dataset but also help to mitigate the hallucination of LLMs generations, with the Natural Language Inference (NLI) metric increasing from 25% to 37% on HaluEval.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized language processing, but face critical challenges with security, privacy, and generating hallucinations — coherent but factually inaccurate outputs. A major issue is fact-conflicting hallucination (FCH), where LLMs produce content contradicting ground truth facts. Addressing FCH is difficult due to two key challenges: 1) Automatically constructing and updating benchmark datasets is hard, as existing methods rely on manually curated static benchmarks that cannot cover the broad, evolving spectrum of FCH cases. 2) Validating the reasoning behind LLM outputs is inherently difficult, especially for complex logical relations. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel logic-programming-aided metamorphic testing technique for FCH detection. We develop an extensive and extensible framework that constructs a comprehensive factual knowledge base by crawling sources like Wikipedia, seamlessly integrated into Drowzee. Using logical reasoning rules, we transform and augment this knowledge into a large set of test cases with ground truth answers. We test LLMs on these cases through template-based prompts, requiring them to provide reasoned answers. To validate their reasoning, we propose two semantic-aware oracles that assess the similarity between the semantic structures of the LLM answers and ground truth. Our approach automatically generates useful test cases and identifies hallucinations across six LLMs within nine domains, with hallucination rates ranging from 24.7% to 59.8%. Key findings include LLMs struggling with temporal concepts, out-of-distribution knowledge, and lack of logical reasoning capabilities. The results show that logic-based test cases generated by Drowzee effectively trigger and detect hallucinations. To further mitigate the identified FCHs, we explored model editing techniques, which proved effective on a small scale (with edits to fewer than 1000 knowledge pieces). Our findings emphasize the need for continued community efforts to detect and mitigate model hallucinations.",

        "title": "A Comprehensive Survey of Hallucination Mitigation Techniques in Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance in their ability to write human-like text, a key challenge remains around their tendency to hallucinate generating content that appears factual but is ungrounded. This issue of hallucination is arguably the biggest hindrance to safely deploying these powerful LLMs into real-world production systems that impact people's lives. The journey toward widespread adoption of LLMs in practical settings heavily relies on addressing and mitigating hallucinations. Unlike traditional AI systems focused on limited tasks, LLMs have been exposed to vast amounts of online text data during training. While this allows them to display impressive language fluency, it also means they are capable of extrapolating information from the biases in training data, misinterpreting ambiguous prompts, or modifying the information to align superficially with the input. This becomes hugely alarming when we rely on language generation capabilities for sensitive applications, such as summarizing medical records, financial analysis reports, etc. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of over 32 techniques developed to mitigate hallucination in LLMs. Notable among these are Retrieval Augmented Generation (Lewis et al, 2021), Knowledge Retrieval (Varshney et al,2023), CoNLI (Lei et al, 2023), and CoVe (Dhuliawala et al, 2023). Furthermore, we introduce a detailed taxonomy categorizing these methods based on various parameters, such as dataset utilization, common tasks, feedback mechanisms, and retriever types. This classification helps distinguish the diverse approaches specifically designed to tackle hallucination issues in LLMs. Additionally, we analyze the challenges and limitations inherent in these techniques, providing a solid foundation for future research in addressing hallucinations and related phenomena within the realm of LLMs.",

Existing detection methods are primarily post-processing, suffering from high computational costs, significant latency, and limited effectiveness due to their separation from the LLM's inference process. They often require extensive and expensive manual annotations for training, which is unsustainable given the rapid evolution of LLMs.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Previous studies mainly focus on post-processing techniques that analyze LLM outputs *after* generation to identify factual errors \\cite{su2024lem}. These include methods based on multi-response consistency, LLM confidence, or proxy models.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   **Computational Intensity & Latency**: Post-processing methods often employ other powerful LLMs for detection, making the cost and latency comparable to or even greater than the original LLM inference.\n        *   **Limited Model Capacity**: By operating independently of the LLM's generation process, these methods cannot analyze how hallucinations are formed internally.\n        *   **Reliance on Manual Annotations**: Proxy models or other supervised approaches require extensive human-annotated data, which is costly to collect and difficult to scale.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper introduces **MIND** (Modeling of INternal states for hallucination Detection), an unsupervised training framework for real-time hallucination detection that leverages the internal states of LLMs. It consists of two main steps:\n        1.  **Unsupervised Training Data Generation**: Automatically annotates hallucinations by taking high-quality Wikipedia articles, truncating them at a random entity, and having the target LLM continue the text. If the LLM's continuation does not start with or contain the correct entity, it's labeled as a hallucination; otherwise, it's a non-hallucination. This process records the LLM's internal states (contextualized embeddings, self-attentions, hidden-layer activations) during generation.\n        2.  **Hallucination Classifier Training**: A lightweight Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is trained to classify hallucinations. The input to the MLP is the contextualized embedding of the *last token of the final Transformer layer* of the LLM, which is found to be highly effective. Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) Loss is used for optimization.\n    *   **Novelty/Differentiation**:\n        *   **Unsupervised**: Eliminates the need for manual annotations by automatically generating pseudo-training data from Wikipedia.\n        *   **Real-time & Internal State-based**: Detects hallucinations *during* the LLM's inference process by analyzing its internal states (specifically contextualized embeddings), significantly reducing computational overhead and latency compared to post-processing methods.\n        *   **Lightweight & Compatible**: Uses a simple MLP, making it efficient and easily integrable into any Transformer-based LLM.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Framework (MIND)**: Proposes an unsupervised, real-time hallucination detection framework that directly utilizes the internal states (contextualized embeddings) of LLMs during generation.\n    *   **Unsupervised Data Generation Mechanism**: Develops a novel method to automatically create hallucination/non-hallucination training data from Wikipedia by comparing LLM-generated continuations with original text entities.\n    *   **Feature Selection Insight**: Demonstrates that the contextualized embedding of the last token in the final Transformer layer is a highly effective and sufficient feature for hallucination detection.\n    *   **New Benchmark (HELM)**: Introduces **HELM** (Hallucination detection Evaluation for multiple LLMs), a comprehensive benchmark dataset featuring:\n        *   Text outputs from six diverse open-source LLMs (base and chat models, 6B-40B parameters).\n        *   Human-annotated hallucination labels at both sentence and passage levels.\n        *   Crucially, the *internal states* (contextualized embeddings, self-attentions, hidden-layer activations) of each LLM recorded during text generation, providing snapshots of their inference process.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Evaluated MIND and several state-of-the-art reference-free hallucination detection baselines on the newly introduced HELM benchmark. Experiments were conducted at both sentence-level and passage-level hallucination detection.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**: Area Under the Curve (AUC) and Pearson correlation coefficient (corr) with human-annotated relevance.\n    *   **Comparison Results**: MIND consistently outperformed existing state-of-the-art baselines, including Predictive Probability (PP), Predictive Entropy (PE), and various SelfCheckGPT (SCG) variants (e.g., SCG_BERTScore, SCG_QA, SCG_NLI, SCG_n-gram). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of using internal states for detection.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**:\n        *   The unsupervised data generation relies on the assumption that an LLM failing to continue a Wikipedia article with the correct entity indicates a hallucination.\n        *   The hallucination classifier is a relatively simple Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), which might have limitations in capturing highly complex or subtle hallucination patterns compared to more sophisticated models.\n        *   The method is specifically designed for Transformer-based LLMs, as it leverages their internal contextualized embeddings.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: Primarily applicable to detecting factual hallucinations in generative LLMs during their inference process. The current data generation method is tied to factual continuation tasks from Wikipedia.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: `MIND` significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by shifting hallucination detection from computationally expensive, post-processing, and annotation-heavy methods to an unsupervised, real-time, and internal-state-based approach. This makes detection more efficient, scalable, and directly integrated with the LLM's generation.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n        *   **Enables Real-time Applications**: The real-time nature of `MIND` opens possibilities for integrating hallucination detection directly into LLM applications, allowing for immediate feedback or correction.\n        *   **Reduces Annotation Burden**: The unsupervised training framework alleviates the significant bottleneck of manual data annotation, accelerating research and development in hallucination detection.\n        *   **New Research Direction**: Highlights the potential of leveraging LLM internal states for deeper insights into their behavior and for developing more intrinsic detection mechanisms.\n        *   **Standardized Evaluation**: The `HELM` benchmark provides a valuable, comprehensive resource for future research, offering diverse LLM outputs with human annotations and, critically, the corresponding internal states, which can foster more robust and comparable evaluations of new detection methods.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized how users access information, shifting from traditional search engines to direct question-and-answer interactions with LLMs. However, the widespread adoption of LLMs has revealed a significant challenge known as hallucination, wherein LLMs generate coherent yet factually inaccurate responses. This hallucination phenomenon has led to users' distrust in information retrieval systems based on LLMs. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes Dynamic Retrieval Augmentation based on hallucination Detection (DRAD) as a novel method to detect and mitigate hallucinations in LLMs. DRAD improves upon traditional retrieval augmentation by dynamically adapting the retrieval process based on real-time hallucination detection. It features two main components: Real-time Hallucination Detection (RHD) for identifying potential hallucinations without external models, and Self-correction based on External Knowledge (SEK) for correcting these errors using external knowledge. Experiment results show that DRAD demonstrates superior performance in both detecting and mitigating hallucinations in LLMs. All of our code and data are open-sourced at https://github.com/oneal2000/EntityHallucination.",

        "abstract": "Hallucination is often regarded as a major impediment for using large language models (LLMs), especially for knowledge-intensive tasks. Even when the training corpus consists solely of true statements, language models still generate hallucinations in the form of amalgamations of multiple facts. We coin this phenomenon as ``knowledge overshadowing'': when we query knowledge from a language model with multiple conditions, some conditions overshadow others, leading to hallucinated outputs. This phenomenon partially stems from training data imbalance, which we verify on both pretrained models and fine-tuned models, over a wide range of LM model families and sizes.From a theoretical point of view, knowledge overshadowing can be interpreted as over-generalization of the dominant conditions (patterns). We show that the hallucination rate grows with both the imbalance ratio (between the popular and unpopular condition) and the length of dominant condition description, consistent with our derived generalization bound. Finally, we propose to utilize overshadowing conditions as a signal to catch hallucination before it is produced, along with a training-free self-contrastive decoding method to alleviate hallucination during inference. Our proposed approach showcases up to 82% F1 for hallucination anticipation and 11.2% to 39.4% hallucination control, with different models and datasets.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review, emphasizing technical innovations and empirical validation:\n\n### Focused Summary for Literature Review: Knowledge Overshadowing Causes Amalgamated Hallucination in Large Language Models \\cite{zhang2024qq9}\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses a specific type of hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) called \"amalgamated hallucination,\" which occurs even when training data is factually correct. This phenomenon is coined \"knowledge overshadowing,\" where, given multiple conditions in a query, some dominant conditions overshadow others, leading to incorrect, amalgamated outputs \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge**: Hallucination is a major impediment to LLM reliability, especially for knowledge-intensive tasks. Existing explanations often point to low-quality data or decoding issues, but this work identifies a persistent hallucination type stemming from data imbalance and over-generalization, posing a fundamental challenge to LLM factual consistency \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Previous studies attribute hallucination to low-quality training data or discrepancies between input/output in decoding \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: This work distinguishes itself by showing that amalgamated hallucinations due to knowledge overshadowing persist even with factually correct training data, indicating that these prior explanations do not fully cover the observed phenomenon \\cite{zhang2024qq9}. It positions knowledge overshadowing as a case of over-generalization, a distinct root cause.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes that knowledge overshadowing is a case of over-generalization of dominant conditions (patterns) in the training data, often stemming from data imbalance.\n    *   **Novelty**:\n        *   **Discovery of Knowledge Overshadowing**: Identifying and formally defining \"knowledge overshadowing\" as a prevalent cause of amalgamated hallucinations in LLMs \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n        *   **Theoretical Interpretation**: Interpreting this phenomenon as over-generalization and deriving a generalization bound that connects hallucination rate with imbalance ratio and condition length \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n        *   **Inference-time Mitigation**: Proposing a novel, training-free, two-step inference-time approach:\n            1.  **Detection**: Utilizing Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) to pre-identify possible overshadowed conditions in the generation prompt.\n            2.  **Alleviation**: Employing a self-contrastive decoding method over dominant conditions to reduce hallucination during inference \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Phenomenon & Analysis**: Discovery and characterization of \"knowledge overshadowing\" as a specific, prevalent type of hallucination caused by popular conditions suppressing less popular ones, leading to factually incorrect outputs \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights**: Quantification of the relationship between imbalance ratio, condition length, and hallucination rate, supported by a derived generalization bound for auto-regressive language modeling that aligns with empirical observations \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n    *   **Novel Mitigation Method**: A simple yet effective training-free self-contrastive decoding method, combined with PMI-based detection, to anticipate and alleviate knowledge overshadowing-induced hallucinations during inference \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**:\n        *   **Verification of Overshadowing**: Probing experiments on pretrained models (Olmo-7b) using natural language queries to demonstrate overshadowing across various conditions (gender, race, occupation, negation) and its correlation with training data mentions \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n        *   **Controlled Fine-tuning Experiments**: Fine-tuning various LLM families (Llama-2-7B, Mistral-7B, GPT-J-6B, Phi-2-2.8B, Pythia-410m) on natural language tasks (Event-Time, Event-Location, Gender Bias, Negation) with controlled data imbalance ratios (10:1 to 100:1) \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n        *   **Synthetic Data Experiments**: Using synthetic datasets with varying imbalance ratios and condition lengths to quantitatively analyze their impact on hallucination rates across Pythia model family sizes (160m to 2.8b) \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n        *   **Generalization Correlation**: Experiments correlating hallucination rate with Gradient Signal-to-Noise Ratio (GSNR) and varying weight decay to demonstrate that overshadowing is linked to over-generalization \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n        *   **Mitigation Method Evaluation**: Extensive experiments evaluating the proposed PMI-detection and self-contrastive decoding method on a mixture of datasets and models \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Results**:\n        *   **Hallucination Rate (HR) / Relative Hallucination Rate (rHR)**: Consistently observed high hallucination rates across all tasks and models.\n        *   **Impact of Imbalance Ratio**: Hallucination rate consistently increased with higher imbalance ratios (e.g., up to 88.3% for Mistral-7B on Negation with 100:1 ratio) \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n        *   **Impact of Model Size**: Larger models exhibited higher hallucination rates, suggesting inverse scaling for this specific hallucination type \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n        *   **Impact of Condition Length**: Longer dominant condition descriptions led to higher hallucination rates \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n        *   **Proposed Method Performance**: The proposed approach achieved up to **82% F1 for hallucination anticipation** and demonstrated **11.2% to 39.4% hallucination control** (reduction in hallucination rate) across different models and datasets \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**: The proposed mitigation method is an inference-time solution, which might not address the fundamental training-time causes of over-generalization. The detection mechanism relies on identifying \"overshadowing conditions\" which might be challenging in highly complex, open-ended prompts \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The work primarily focuses on \"amalgamated hallucinations\" caused by \"knowledge overshadowing\" due to data imbalance and over-generalization. It does not claim to address all forms of LLM hallucination \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: This paper significantly advances the understanding of LLM hallucination by identifying a novel and prevalent mechanism (\"knowledge overshadowing\") that persists even with factual training data. It provides a theoretical framework (over-generalization and generalization bound) to explain this phenomenon \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n    *   **Potential Impact**: The proposed training-free, inference-time detection and mitigation method offers a practical and immediate solution for improving the factual consistency of LLMs in knowledge-intensive applications. This work opens new avenues for research into data-centric approaches and decoding strategies to combat specific types of hallucinations \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.",

Evolution Analysis:**\n\nThe evolution of research into \"Hallucination in Large Language Models\" can be understood through two major, intertwined trends: the progression from task-specific characterization to general LLM-centric understanding and evaluation, and the shift from post-hoc correction to proactive prevention and dynamic knowledge integration.\n\n**Trend 1: From Task-Specific Characterization to General LLM-Centric Understanding and Evaluation**\n\n*   *Methodological progression*: The initial phase of understanding hallucination began with **human evaluation and empirical analysis** focused on specific Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks. [maynez2020h3q] (2020) pioneered this by systematically characterizing hallucinations in abstractive summarization, emphasizing human judgment and the inadequacy of surface-level metrics. This foundational work led to a demand for more versatile evaluation. [liu2021mo6] (2021) responded by developing a **reference-free, token-level detection benchmark** (HADES), expanding the scope to general free-form text generation. As Large Language Models (LLMs) gained prominence, the methodology evolved into **comprehensive meta-analyses and taxonomies**, exemplified by [zhang2023k1j] (2023) and [ye2023yom] (2023), which consolidated fragmented knowledge into structured frameworks. Concurrently, the need for realistic evaluation spurred the creation of **unconstrained generation benchmarks**, such as UHG Eval by [liang20236sh] (2023), specifically for Chinese LLMs, moving beyond artificial, constrained generation scenarios.\n\n*   *Problem evolution*: The problem initially identified was \"unfaithful content in abstractive summarization\" ([maynez2020h3q]). This quickly broadened to the challenge of **fine-grained hallucination detection in free-form text** where ground-truth references are unavailable ([liu2021mo6]). The scope further expanded to **cross-modal contexts** with the discovery of object hallucination in vision-language models ([dai20229aa]), revealing that hallucination was not solely a text-to-text issue. The rapid emergence of powerful, general-purpose LLMs then necessitated a **unified understanding of hallucination across diverse tasks** and its unique challenges ([zhang2023k1j], [ye2023yom]). This also highlighted the critical need for **realistic, unconstrained evaluation benchmarks**, particularly for non-English languages like Chinese ([liang20236sh]), as existing methods were often biased or insufficient for real-world LLM deployment.\n\n*   *Key innovations*: Key innovations include [maynez2020h3q]'s **categorization of hallucinations** and advocacy for **textual entailment**; [liu2021mo6]'s **token-level, reference-free detection task and HADES dataset**; [dai20229aa]'s **systematic study of object hallucination in VLP** and the **ObjMLM pre-training objective**; [zhang2023k1j]'s **expanded taxonomy of LLM hallucination** and its analytical framework; [liang202366sh]'s **UHG Eval benchmark** with its **unconstrained generation paradigm** and **`kwPrec` metric**; and [ye2023yom]'s **novel, detailed taxonomy across tasks** and in-depth **mechanistic analysis of hallucination origins**.\n\n**Trend 2: From Post-Hoc Correction to Proactive Prevention and Dynamic Knowledge Integration**\n\n*   *Methodological progression*: Early mitigation efforts involved **post-hoc refinement using external knowledge** ([dziri2021bw9] for dialogue with KGs) or **training-time interventions** ([goyal2021onb]'s loss truncation for summarization). This progressed to **data-centric approaches** like [adams202289x]'s reference revision, and **decoding-time semantic steering** ([sridhar2022l1c]'s NLI-assisted beam search). With the rise of LLMs, the focus shifted to **leveraging LLMs themselves as noisy knowledge sources** ([li2022ypy]), then to sophisticated **LLM self-correction mechanisms** ([dhuliawala2023rqn]'s Chain-of-Verification), and finally to **proactive prevention** ([luo2023xyc]'s SELF-FAMILIARITY) and **dynamic, real-time external knowledge augmentation** ([vu202337s]'s FreshLLMs).\n\n*   *Problem evolution*: Initially, the problem was correcting hallucinations in generated text, often by comparing to a source or static KG ([dziri2021bw9], [dong20223yz]). A key challenge was **noisy training data** ([adams202289x]) and the **lack of understanding of how hallucinations are learned** ([goyal2021onb]). As LLMs became more powerful, the problem evolved to **managing their inherent noise when used as knowledge sources** ([li2022ypy]) and preventing them from **repeating their own errors** ([dhuliawala2023rqn]). The ultimate challenge became **preventing hallucinations *before* they occur** ([luo2023xyc]) and addressing the **temporal knowledge gap** where LLMs become outdated ([vu202337s]).\n\n*   *Key innovations*: Notable innovations include [dziri2021bw9]'s **NEURAL PATH HUNTER** for KG-grounded dialogue correction; [goyal2021onb]'s **`LOSSTRUNCATION`** for steering training towards factuality; [adams202289x]'s **ReDRESS** for synthetic data to revise noisy references; [dong20223yz]'s **FILM-based generate-and-revise** for integrating external world knowledge into summarization; [sridhar2022l1c]'s **NLI-assisted beam re-ranking during decoding**; [li2022ypy]'s **Posterior-based Reweighing** and **Noisy Training Strategy** to robustly handle LLM-generated knowledge; [dhuliawala2023rqn]'s **Chain-of-Verification (CoVe)** for systematic LLM self-correction; [luo2023xyc]'s **`SELF-FAMILIARITY`** and its \"Concept Guessing\" mechanism, pioneering a *pre-detection* approach; and [vu202337s]'s **FRESH PROMPT** and **FRESH QA benchmark**, enabling dynamic, real-time knowledge augmentation for LLMs.\n\n**3. Synthesis**\n\nThese works collectively trace an intellectual trajectory from initially defining and characterizing hallucination in specific NLG tasks to developing sophisticated, LLM-native strategies for its detection, mitigation, and prevention across diverse applications. Their collective contribution is a progressively deeper understanding of hallucination's mechanisms, a broadening of its scope to new modalities and languages, and the development of increasingly proactive and dynamic solutions to enhance the factual reliability and trustworthiness of large language models."

The field has moved from identifying and broadly categorizing hallucination in LLMs to:\n    1.  A *multimodal expansion*, recognizing hallucination as a pervasive challenge across different AI modalities.\n    2.  A *deeper, more theoretical understanding* of its fundamental causes.\n    3.  The development of *highly granular, rationale-focused evaluation methods*.\n    4.  The creation of *adaptive, proactive, and application-specific mitigation strategies* that go beyond simple post-hoc corrections.\n    The narrative now emphasizes the complexity and multifaceted nature of hallucination, requiring tailored solutions and a more profound theoretical grounding.\n\n**Temporal Positioning:**\nAll new papers are from 2024 or 2025, representing the latest developments in the field. They build directly upon the 2023 papers, showcasing a rapid and significant evolution in research focus and sophistication within a very short timeframe.\n\n2.  *Updated Evolution Analysis:*\n\nThe research landscape surrounding \"Hallucination in Large Language Models\" has undergone a rapid and profound evolution, particularly in 2024 and extending into 2025. Building upon initial efforts to define, categorize, and mitigate hallucination in unimodal LLMs, the field has diversified into multimodal domains, deepened its theoretical understanding, and developed increasingly sophisticated, adaptive, and application-specific solutions. This progression can be understood through four intertwined trends: the expansion of hallucination to multimodal AI, the deepening of mechanistic understanding, the evolution of evaluation towards granularity and rationale, and the advancement of adaptive and proactive mitigation strategies.\n\n**Trend 1: Expanding the Scope of Hallucination: From Unimodal LLMs to Multimodal AI**\n*Methodological progression*: Initially, research focused on hallucination in text-only LLMs, as surveyed by [zhang2023k1j] Siren's Song in the AI Ocean (2023) and [ye2023yom] Cognitive Mirage (2023). These works provided foundational taxonomies and analyses for LLM-specific hallucination. The latest research marks a significant methodological shift by extending this problem to **multimodal Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)** and **Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs)**.\n*Problem evolution*: The problem of hallucination is no longer confined to text. New papers identify unique challenges arising from the \"modality gap\" and the integration of visual or audio information. For instance, [liu2024sn3] A Survey on Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (2024) and [lan20240yz] A Survey of Hallucination in Large Visual Language Models (2024) comprehensively define and categorize hallucination in LVLMs, highlighting issues like object, attribute, and relation errors. [kuan20249pm] Understanding Sounds, Missing the Questions (2024) further extends this to LALMs, investigating \"object hallucination\" in audio contexts. This addresses the limitation of previous LLM-centric views by acknowledging the distinct ways hallucinations manifest in multimodal systems.\n*Key innovations*: The primary innovation here is the *systematic identification and categorization of multimodal hallucinations* and the development of *modality-specific evaluation methodologies*. [kaul2024ta7] THRONE (2024) introduces a novel benchmark for \"Type I hallucinations\" (free-form generations) in LVLMs, distinguishing them from fixed-format responses. [zhong2024mfi] Investigating and Mitigating the Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing (2024) identifies and quantifies \"multimodal hallucination snowballing,\" a critical extension of the \"snowballing\" concept previously identified for LLMs by [kang202378c] Ever (2023).\n*Integration points*: These multimodal works build directly upon the conceptual frameworks established by [zhang2023k1j] and [ye2023yom], adapting and expanding their taxonomies to new modalities.\n\n**Trend 2: Deepening Mechanistic Understanding and Theoretical Foundations**\n*Methodological progression*: While [zhang2023k1j] and [ye2023yom] provided initial mechanistic analyses, recent work moves towards a more rigorous, theoretical, and granular understanding of hallucination origins.\n*Problem evolution*: The field recognized the need to move beyond empirical observations to understand the *fundamental causes* of hallucination. [li2025qzg] Loki's Dance of Illusions (2025) addresses the lack of a unified theoretical framework, proposing a formal mathematical definition and exploring \"mathematical origins\" (e.g., undecidability principles) and \"empirical causes\" (data, architecture, cognitive processing). [zhang2024qq9] Knowledge Overshadowing Causes Amalgamated Hallucination (2024) identifies a specific, novel root cause: \"knowledge overshadowing,\" where dominant conditions in training data lead to over-generalization and \"amalgamated hallucinations.\" This addresses the limitation that hallucinations persist even with factually correct data.\n*Key innovations*: The introduction of a *unified theoretical framework* and *formal mathematical definitions* ([li2025qzg]) represents a significant conceptual leap. The discovery and characterization of \"knowledge overshadowing\" ([zhang2024qq9]) provide a new, specific mechanistic insight, supported by a derived generalization bound.\n*Integration points*: These papers build directly on the problem identification and initial categorization efforts of [zhang2023k1j] and [ye2023yom], providing deeper \"why\" and \"how\" explanations.\n\n**Trend 3: Evolving Evaluation: Towards Granular, Rationale-based, and Complex Reasoning Benchmarks**\n*Methodological progression*: The initial focus on reproducible, automatically evaluable benchmarks for factual correctness and citation quality by [gao2023ht7] Enabling Large Language Models to Generate Text with Citations (2023) has evolved into more sophisticated and fine-grained evaluation methodologies.\n*Problem evolution*: The limitation of evaluating only final answers or simple factual statements became apparent. Researchers needed benchmarks that could assess complex reasoning, verify the model's thought process, and handle diverse hallucination types. [oh2024xa3] ERBench (2024) addresses this by leveraging relational databases to create *automatically verifiable questions and rationales*, moving beyond simple answer correctness. [tang2024a1j] GraphArena (2024) tackles the challenge of evaluating LLMs on *real-world graph computational problems*, including NP-complete tasks, revealing high hallucination rates in complex algorithmic reasoning. For LVLMs, [kaul2024ta7] THRONE (2024) addresses the inadequacy of prior benchmarks for free-form generations by using LM-based semantic judgment.\n*Key innovations*: *Rationale verification* ([oh2024xa3]) and *complex algorithmic reasoning benchmarks* ([tang2024a1j]) are key innovations, providing deeper insights into LLM reasoning failures. The use of *LM-based semantic judgment* in THRONE ([kaul2024ta7]) significantly improves the accuracy of hallucination detection in open-ended multimodal outputs.\n*Integration points*: These works directly extend and refine the evaluation paradigm established by [gao2023ht7], pushing the boundaries of what can be automatically and rigorously assessed in LLM outputs.\n\n**Trend 4: Advanced and Adaptive Mitigation: From Post-hoc to Proactive, Context-Aware, and Application-Specific Solutions**\n*Methodological progression*: The shift from post-hoc evaluation to real-time, proactive mitigation, exemplified by [kang202378c]'s EVER framework (2023), has accelerated. New methods are increasingly adaptive, context-aware, and tailored for specific scenarios.\n*Problem evolution*: The limitations of fixed mitigation strategies and the need for more robust, efficient, and domain-specific solutions became critical. [tjandra2024umq] Fine-Tuning Large Language Models to Appropriately Abstain with Semantic Entropy (2024) addresses the need for *label-free abstention* by introducing *semantic entropy*, making uncertainty-aware models more scalable. For Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), [lv2024k5x] Coarse-to-Fine Highlighting (2024) tackles the \"getting lost in long contexts\" problem by *intelligently highlighting key information*. [ding20244yr] Retrieve Only When It Needs (2024) introduces *adaptive retrieval augmentation* (Rowen), dynamically deciding when to retrieve based on *cross-language/cross-model consistency*, mitigating both internal and external hallucinations. [yang20251dw] Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models with Metamorphic Relations (2025) offers a *zero-resource, self-contained detection* method using *metamorphic relations*, overcoming dependencies on external resources or internal model access. In safety-critical domains, [hakim2024d4u] The Need for Guardrails with Large Language Models in Medical Safety-Critical Settings (2024) proposes *semantic guardrails* to prevent \"never event\" errors in pharmacovigilance, highlighting the need for application-specific safety. For LVLMs, [chen20247jb] Alleviating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models through Hallucination-Induced Optimization (2024) introduces a novel \"hallucination-induced optimization\" (HIO) for contrastive decoding, while [zhong2024mfi] proposes *Residual Visual Decoding (RVD)* to mitigate multimodal snowballing. [chang2024u3t] A Unified Hallucination Mitigation Framework for Large Vision-Language Models (2024) further unifies LVLM mitigation by classifying query types and applying tailored, iterative treatments. [tonmoy20244e4] A Comprehensive Survey of Hallucination Mitigation Techniques (2024) provides a broad overview of these diverse techniques.\n*Key innovations*: Innovations include *semantic entropy for abstention* ([tjandra2024umq]), *adaptive RAG with cross-modal/cross-language consistency* ([ding20244yr]), *metamorphic relations for detection* ([yang20251dw]), *application-specific semantic guardrails* ([hakim2024d4u]), *hallucination-induced optimization* ([chen20247jb]), and *query-type specific iterative mitigation* for LVLMs ([chang2024u3t]).\n*Integration points*: These papers build upon the proactive mitigation philosophy of [kang202378c], extending it with more intelligent, context-aware, and domain-specific mechanisms, and providing a comprehensive overview of the landscape ([tonmoy20244e4]).\n\n3. *Refined Synthesis*\nThe collective body of work, spanning 2023-2025, reveals a rapid maturation in addressing LLM hallucination, evolving from initial problem identification and basic mitigation to a sophisticated, multi-faceted scientific endeavor. This expanded view highlights a unified intellectual trajectory: a relentless pursuit of trustworthy AI, driven by a deepening theoretical understanding of hallucination's diverse origins, its expansion into multimodal domains, the development of granular and rationale-focused evaluation benchmarks, and the creation of increasingly adaptive, proactive, and application-specific mitigation strategies. The collective contribution is the establishment of a robust, interdisciplinary framework essential for building truly reliable and safe large language models across all modalities.",

        "title": "Enabling Large Language Models to Generate Text with Citations",
        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a widely-used tool for information seeking, but their generated outputs are prone to hallucination. In this work, our aim is to allow LLMs to generate text with citations, improving their factual correctness and verifiability. Existing work mainly relies on commercial search engines and human evaluation, making it challenging to reproduce and compare different modeling approaches. We propose ALCE, the first benchmark for Automatic LLMs' Citation Evaluation. ALCE collects a diverse set of questions and retrieval corpora and requires building end-to-end systems to retrieve supporting evidence and generate answers with citations. We develop automatic metrics along three dimensions -- fluency, correctness, and citation quality -- and demonstrate their strong correlation with human judgements. Our experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs and novel prompting strategies show that current systems have considerable room for improvement -- For example, on the ELI5 dataset, even the best models lack complete citation support 50% of the time. Our analyses further highlight promising future directions, including developing better retrievers, advancing long-context LLMs, and improving the ability to synthesize information from multiple sources.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review, emphasizing technical innovations and empirical validation:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination and factual incorrectness, making their outputs untrustworthy and difficult to verify. The paper addresses the challenge of enabling LLMs to generate text with verifiable citations.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: This problem is crucial for building trustworthy LLM applications for information seeking. Existing approaches often rely on commercial search engines and human evaluation, which are expensive, difficult to reproduce, and hinder systematic comparison and advancement of modeling approaches.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Commercial systems (e.g., Bing Chat, perplexity.ai) and prior research (e.g., Nakano et al., 2021; Menick et al., 2022) share the motivation of providing references. Retrieval-augmented LMs (e.g., Borgeaud et al., 2022; Izacard et al., 2022) incorporate retrieved passages but do not guarantee faithfulness or explicitly provide citations.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Previous work primarily uses commercial/closed-source models and relies heavily on human evaluation, making results irreproducible and progress difficult to measure. There was a lack of a standardized, automatically evaluable benchmark for LLM citation generation.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: \\cite{gao2023ht7} proposes **ALCE (Automatic LLMs’ Citation Evaluation)**, the first reproducible benchmark for evaluating end-to-end systems that retrieve supporting evidence, generate answers, and provide citations. The task involves a natural-language question and a retrieval corpus, requiring systems to output statements with explicit citations to passages from the corpus.\n    *   **Novelty/Differentiation**:\n        *   **Benchmark Design**: ALCE compiles three diverse datasets (ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5) covering various question types and corpora (Wikipedia, Web-scale Sphere), requiring long-text generation and multi-source synthesis. It allows citing multiple passages per statement.\n        *   **Automatic Evaluation Metrics**: Introduces a robust suite of automatic metrics across three dimensions:\n            *   **Fluency**: Measured by MAUVE \\cite{gao2023ht7}.\n            *   **Correctness**: Tailored metrics for each dataset: Exact Match Recall (ASQA), Precision/Recall-5 (QAMPARI), and NLI-based Claim Recall using InstructGPT and TRUE (ELI5) \\cite{gao2023ht7}.\n            *   **Citation Quality**: Novel NLI-based metrics (using TRUE) for **citation recall** (whether a statement is fully supported by its citations) and **citation precision** (identifying irrelevant citations) \\cite{gao2023ht7}.\n        *   **Prompting Strategies**: Explores novel prompting strategies for LLMs to synthesize retrieved text and generate citations, including VANILLA (direct prompting), SUMM/SNIPPET (using summaries/snippets of passages to fit more context), INTERACTIVE (allowing LLM to decide when/what to retrieve), RERANK (reranking multiple generations), and LONG-CONTEXT (incorporating more passages) \\cite{gao2023ht7}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Benchmark**: ALCE, a publicly available and reproducible benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to generate text with citations, addressing a critical gap in the field \\cite{gao2023ht7}.\n    *   **Automated Evaluation Framework**: A comprehensive set of automatic metrics for fluency, correctness, and citation quality, demonstrated to correlate strongly with human judgments, enabling scalable and objective evaluation \\cite{gao2023ht7}.\n    *   **Formalization of Citation Task**: Clearly defines the task setup, including statement segmentation and the mechanism for multi-passage citation, providing a standardized framework for future research \\cite{gao2023ht7}.\n    *   **Empirical Analysis & Insights**: Extensive experiments and analyses that reveal current LLM limitations and highlight promising future research directions in retrieval, long-context models, and multi-document synthesis \\cite{gao2023ht7}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Evaluated state-of-the-art LLMs (ChatGPT, GPT-4) and off-the-shelf retrievers (GTR, DPR, BM25) on the ALCE benchmark using various prompting strategies \\cite{gao2023ht7}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**: Fluency (MAUVE), Correctness (EM recall, precision/recall-5, claim recall), and Citation Quality (citation recall, citation precision) \\cite{gao2023ht7}.\n    *   **Comparison Results**:\n        *   Automatic metrics showed strong correlation with human judgments, validating their robustness \\cite{gao2023ht7}.\n        *   Current systems, even the best models (e.g., GPT-4), demonstrated significant room for improvement; for instance, on ELI5, around 50% of generations lacked complete citation support \\cite{gao2023ht7}.\n        *   **Specific Findings**:\n            *   Closed-book models with post-hoc citing achieved good correctness but poor citation quality \\cite{gao2023ht7}.\n            *   Interactive retrieval approaches did not significantly improve performance on this benchmark \\cite{gao2023ht7}.\n            *   Summarizing retrieved passages improved correctness but not citation quality \\cite{gao2023ht7}.\n            *   Reranking multiple generations boosted human-evaluated citation quality \\cite{gao2023ht7}.\n            *   Incorporating more retrieved passages in context improved GPT-4's performance but not ChatGPT's \\cite{gao2023ht7}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**: Identified major challenges: (1) retrieval quality is a crucial bottleneck, (2) LLMs' limited context windows restrict the number of passages they can incorporate, and (3) current LLMs struggle to synthesize information from multiple documents without being distracted by irrelevant content \\cite{gao2023ht7}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The benchmark primarily assesses the citation capabilities of *existing* LLMs and does not provide training data for citation supervision. The chosen datasets focus on factual questions requiring long-text answers and multi-source synthesis.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: \\cite{gao2023ht7} significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing the first reproducible benchmark and a robust automatic evaluation framework for LLM citation generation. This enables systematic research and development in a previously challenging area.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: The work addresses a critical issue of LLM hallucination and verifiability, paving the way for more trustworthy and reliable LLM applications. It highlights key research directions, including improving retrieval systems, developing more capable long-context LLMs, and enhancing LLMs' ability to synthesize information from multiple sources faithfully \\cite{gao2023ht7}.",

        "abstract": "\n While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a range of downstream tasks, a significant concern revolves around their propensity to exhibit hallucinations: LLMs occasionally generate content that diverges from the user input, contradicts previously generated context, or misaligns with established world knowledge. This phenomenon poses a substantial challenge to the reliability of LLMs in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we survey recent efforts on the detection, explanation, and mitigation of hallucination, with an emphasis on the unique challenges posed by LLMs. We present taxonomies of the LLM hallucination phenomena and evaluation benchmarks, analyze existing approaches aiming at mitigating LLM hallucination, and discuss potential directions for future research.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **CITATION REQUIREMENTS**: Always use \"\\cite{zhang2023k1j}\" when referencing this paper.\n\n---\n\n**TECHNICAL PAPER ANALYSIS**:\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **What specific technical problem does this paper address?**\n        This paper addresses the pervasive problem of \"hallucination\" in Large Language Models (LLMs), where models generate content that deviates from user input, contradicts previously generated context, or misaligns with established world knowledge \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n    *   **Why is this problem important and challenging?**\n        Hallucination significantly undermines the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs in real-world applications, potentially leading to severe consequences (e.g., fabricating erroneous medical diagnoses). The problem is particularly challenging for LLMs due to:\n        *   **Massive training data:** Pre-training on web-scale data often includes fabricated, outdated, or biased information, making it difficult to eliminate sources of hallucination \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n        *   **Versatility of LLMs:** Their general-purpose nature across tasks, languages, and domains complicates comprehensive evaluation and robust mitigation strategies \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n        *   **Imperceptibility of errors:** LLMs can generate highly plausible, yet false, information that is difficult for both models and humans to detect \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n        *   Additional factors like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), vague knowledge boundaries, and the black-box nature of LLMs further complicate detection, explanation, and mitigation \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **How does this work relate to existing approaches?**\n        While hallucination has been extensively studied in conventional Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks, this survey specifically focuses on the *unique and amplified challenges* presented by LLMs \\cite{zhang2023k1j}. It positions itself as a comprehensive review of recent efforts tailored to the LLM era.\n    *   **What are the limitations of previous solutions?**\n        Previous studies on hallucination in traditional NLG are often task-specific and do not adequately address the complexities arising from LLMs' massive scale, versatility, and the subtle nature of their errors \\cite{zhang2023k1j}. The paper highlights that while input- and context-conflicting hallucinations were previously explored, *fact-conflicting hallucination* in LLMs poses more complex challenges due to the absence of an authoritative knowledge source and its greater practical impact \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **What is the core technical method or algorithm?**\n        As a survey, the core technical approach is a systematic and comprehensive review and structured analysis of the current landscape of LLM hallucination research \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in generating fluent text. However, they often encounter the challenge of generating inaccurate or hallucinated content. This issue is common in both non-retrieval-based generation and retrieval-augmented generation approaches, and existing post-hoc rectification methods may not address the accumulated hallucination errors that may be caused by the\"snowballing\"issue, especially in reasoning tasks. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel approach called Real-time Verification and Rectification (Ever). Instead of waiting until the end of the generation process to rectify hallucinations, Ever employs a real-time, step-wise generation and hallucination rectification strategy. The primary objective is to detect and rectify hallucinations as they occur during the text generation process. When compared to both retrieval-based and non-retrieval-based baselines, Ever demonstrates a significant improvement in generating trustworthy and factually accurate text across a diverse range of tasks, including short-form QA, biography generation, and multi-hop reasoning.",

Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Tasks:** Evaluated on long-form biography generation and reasoning tasks, where hallucination snowballing is prevalent \\cite{kang202378c}.\n    *   **Metrics:** FACTSCORE \\cite{min2023factscore} (a retrieval-augmented metric aligning with human evaluation) was used for biography generation \\cite{kang202378c}.\n    *   **Baselines:** Compared against various non-retrieval (e.g., Zero-Shot LLMs, Dola, CoVE), retrieval-augmented rectification (RRAR), and RAG-like (Vanilla RAG, Self-RAG) methods \\cite{kang202378c}.\n    *   **EVER Variants:** Tested with `EVER (NRG+SQ)`, `EVER (NRG+ER)`, and `EVER (RAG+ER)` to assess different generation and validation strategies \\cite{kang202378c}.\n    *   **Key Results:**\n        *   EVER consistently achieved significant improvements in factual accuracy across all scenarios (non-retrieval, retrieval-augmented rectification, and RAG-like) compared to baselines \\cite{kang202378c}.\n        *   `EVER (NRG+SQ)` outperformed the post-hoc verification method CoVE on Llama 65B \\cite{kang202378c}.\n        *   `EVER (NRG+ER)` demonstrated superior and more stable factual precision than RRAR, particularly for rare subjects, highlighting its robustness across varying data rarity \\cite{kang202378c}.\n        *   `EVER (RAG+ER)` significantly improved upon conventional RAG, showcasing its effectiveness as a complementary method for refining retrieved information \\cite{kang202378c}.\n        *   The paper also demonstrates that EVER-generated data can lead to better preference data for enhancing LLM factuality through preference tuning \\cite{kang202378c}.\n\n*   **6. Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations:** Completely rectifying all extrinsic hallucinations remains challenging; EVER addresses this by transparently flagging unverified content with a \"not sure\" warning rather than always achieving full correction \\cite{kang202378c}. The effectiveness relies on the LLM's ability to accurately perform concept identification, question generation, and support checking.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** Primarily applicable to tasks requiring high factual accuracy and where long-form generation or reasoning can lead to error propagation, such as biography generation and multi-hop reasoning \\cite{kang202378c}. It is compatible with both non-retrieval and retrieval-augmented generation paradigms \\cite{kang202378c}.\n\n*   **7. Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art:** EVER \\cite{kang202378c} significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in LLM hallucination mitigation by introducing a robust real-time, step-wise verification and rectification framework that effectively tackles the \"snowballing\" problem.\n    *   **Enhanced Trustworthiness:** By proactively identifying and correcting errors and transparently flagging unverified information, it substantially improves the trustworthiness and factual accuracy of LLM outputs.\n    *   **Versatile Integration:** Its compatibility with existing RAG methods and its utility in generating high-quality preference data for model alignment make it a versatile and impactful contribution to LLM development \\cite{kang202378c}.\n    *   **Future Research Impact:** This work opens new avenues for research into more sophisticated real-time control mechanisms for LLM generation, fine-grained factual verification, and dynamic self-correction architectures.",

It first introduces LVLM architecture (perceptual, cross-modal, response modules) and identifies the main causes of hallucination:\n        *   **Modality Gap**: Differences in data distribution, features, and semantics between visual and textual modalities, leading to biased understanding.\n        *   **Toxicity in Dataset**: Presence of misleading or hallucinatory samples in large-scale training datasets, often generated by other LLMs/LVLMs.\n        *   **LLM Hallucinations**: Inherited hallucination tendencies from the underlying LLMs used as the \"brain\" of LVLMs, including conflicts with parametric knowledge and randomness in decoding strategies.\n    *   **Novelty/Differentiation**: The primary innovation lies in its novel taxonomic strategy for organizing hallucination correction methods and evaluation benchmarks. Correction methods are categorized into three core ideas:\n        *   **Dataset Dehallucination**: Focuses on improving training data quality.\n        *   **Modalities Gap**: Aims to enhance visual comprehension and bridge the gap between visual and textual representations.\n        *   **Output Correction**: Addresses hallucinations during or after the generation process.\n    *   It also provides a structured overview of evaluation benchmarks, classifying them as \"Judgmental\" or \"Generative.\"\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Taxonomy**: Proposes a novel and comprehensive taxonomy for hallucination correction methods in LVLMs, categorizing them into Dataset Dehallucination, Modalities Gap, and Output Correction.\n    *   **Categorization of Causes**: Clearly identifies and attributes the main technical causes of hallucination in LVLMs to the modality gap, dataset toxicity, and inherent LLM hallucinations.\n    *   **Survey of Evaluation Benchmarks**: Systematically presents available hallucination evaluation benchmarks for LVLMs, distinguishing between judgmental and generative perspectives.\n    *   **Future Research Directions**: Suggests future research avenues to enhance the dependability and utility of LVLMs by addressing the identified challenges.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   The paper itself is a survey and does not conduct new experiments. Instead, it *reviews* the experimental validation strategies employed by the research it summarizes.\n    *   **Types of Experiments/Benchmarks Reviewed**:\n        *   **Judgmental Benchmarks**: Evaluate LVLM responses based on human judgment or specific factual checks. Examples include:\n            *   **Object Hallucination**: POPE \\cite{lan20240yz}, CIEM \\cite{lan20240yz}, EMMA \\cite{lan20240yz}, Merlim \\cite{lan20240yz} (focus on existence, properties, inter-relationships of objects).\n            *   **Parametric Knowledge**: MME \\cite{lan20240yz}, Hallusionbench \\cite{lan20240yz} (assess factual consistency with world knowledge).\n            *   **Self-awareness**: MM-SAP \\cite{lan20240yz}.\n            *   **Special Phenomenon**: VHTest \\cite{lan20240yz}.\n        *   **Generative Benchmarks**: Use automated metrics or specific setups to quantify hallucination in generated text. Examples include:\n            *   **Metrics**: CHAIR \\cite{lan20240yz}, AMBER \\cite{lan20240yz}.\n            *   **Fraudulent Input**: MAD-Bench \\cite{lan20240yz}, CorrelationQA \\cite{lan20240yz}.\n            *   **Visual Drift**: GenCeption \\cite{lan20240yz}.\n            *   **Image Sequences**: Mementos \\cite{lan20240yz}.\n            *   **Reverse Expansion**: UniHD \\cite{lan20240yz}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**: The reviewed papers typically use metrics related to factual accuracy, object existence verification, consistency, and human preference scores to evaluate hallucination mitigation.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations (of LVLMs, as discussed)**: The paper highlights inherent limitations of current LVLMs, such as their reliance on parametric knowledge when visual information is insufficient, the difficulty in bridging the modality gap, and the propagation of biases/hallucinations from training datasets and underlying LLMs.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The survey focuses specifically on hallucination in *Large Visual Language Models*, covering their structure, causes, correction methods, and evaluation. It does not delve into other potential issues of LVLMs or hallucination in other AI model types beyond its direct relevance to LVLMs.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: This survey significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing a much-needed, structured, and comprehensive overview of hallucination in LVLMs. Its novel taxonomy helps organize a rapidly growing field, making it easier for researchers to understand the landscape of existing solutions and identify gaps.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: By clearly outlining the causes, correction strategies, and evaluation methods, the paper serves as a foundational resource. It guides future research by suggesting promising directions for developing more robust, reliable, and trustworthy LVLMs, particularly in areas like improving data quality, enhancing cross-modal understanding, and refining output generation.",

        "abstract": "The ``arms race'' of Large Language Models (LLMs) demands new benchmarks to examine their progresses. In this paper, we introduce GraphArena, a benchmarking tool designed to evaluate LLMs on real-world graph computational problems. It offers a suite of four polynomial-time tasks (e.g., Shortest Distance) and six NP-complete challenges (e.g., Traveling Salesman Problem). GraphArena features a rigorous evaluation framework that classifies LLM outputs as correct, suboptimal (feasible but not optimal), hallucinatory (properly formatted but infeasible), or missing. Evaluation of over 10 LLMs reveals that even top-performing LLMs struggle with larger, more complex graph problems and exhibit hallucination issues. We further explore four potential solutions to address this issue and improve LLMs on graph computation, including chain-of-thought prompting, instruction tuning, code writing, and scaling test-time compute, each demonstrating unique strengths and limitations.

This involves a three-step process:\n            1.  **Path Extraction:** Using regular expressions to extract the proposed solution path.\n            2.  **Feasibility Check:** Script-based verification of whether the extracted path meets basic problem requirements.\n            3.  **Optimality Verification:** Calculation of a path score and comparison against the ground truth optimal

preventing pattern-based guessing.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Benchmark Design:** Introduction of GraphArena, a novel benchmark specifically designed for evaluating LLMs on real-world graph computational problems, encompassing both polynomial-time and NP-complete tasks.\n    *   **Advanced Graph Sampling Methodology:** Employs a random walk with restart strategy to extract topologically representative subgraphs from large real-world datasets, ensuring ecological validity.\n    *   **Multi-dimensional Task Taxonomy:** Categorization of tasks into \"direct algorithmic reasoning\" (polynomial-time) and \"meta-algorithmic planning\" (NP-complete) to probe different facets of LLM intelligence.\n    *   **Fine-grained Evaluation Protocol:** Development of a three-step (Path Extraction, Feasibility Check, Optimality Verification) evaluation framework that moves beyond simple answer matching to assess the correctness, feasibility, and optimality of the *solution process* generated by LLMs.\n    *   **Exploration of Improvement Strategies:** Investigates the effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought prompting, instruction tuning, code generation, and scaling test-time compute as methods to enhance LLM performance on graph reasoning.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:**\n        *   Evaluated over 10 prominent LLMs (including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-sonnet, Llama3, Deepseek-V2) on 10,000 GraphArena problems (500 small, 500 large for each of 10 tasks).\n        *   Compared LLM performance against traditional graph algorithms, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Graph-LLM hybrid approaches.\n        *   Explored four strategies to improve LLM performance: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, instruction tuning, code writing, and increasing test-time compute.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Results:**\n        *   **LLM Performance:** Top-performing LLMs (e.g., Claude-3.5-sonnet, GPT-4o) struggle significantly with larger and more complex graph problems, particularly NP-complete tasks, exhibiting high hallucination rates (e.g., up to 40.7% for GPT-4o-mini on large polynomial tasks).\n        *   **Task Difficulty:** LLMs perform significantly better on polynomial-time tasks (direct algorithmic reasoning) than on NP-complete tasks (meta-algorithmic planning), where they often default to greedy algorithms.\n        *   **Graph Size Impact:** Performance degrades substantially as graph size increases, with hallucination rates rising.\n        *   **Improvement Strategies:**\n            *   **Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** Showed limited effectiveness on GraphArena.\n            *   **Instruction Tuning:** Enhanced performance on small-scale polynomial tasks but was less effective for large-scale NP problems.\n            *   **Code Generation:** Demonstrated significant promise for solving large graphs and complex tasks, though some performance degradation was observed on small graphs.\n            *   **Scaling Test-Time Compute:** Yielded modest but consistent performance improvements.\n        *   **Baselines:** The paper notes comparison with traditional algorithms, GNNs, and Graph-LLM hybrids, providing a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' capabilities relative to established methods.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:**\n        *   The benchmark focuses on specific graph computational problems and does not cover all possible graph-related reasoning tasks (e.g., graph generation, graph representation learning).\n        *   The problem encoding into text can result in long contexts (up to 6,000 tokens), which itself poses a challenge for LLMs, potentially conflating long-context understanding with graph reasoning.\n        *   The study conducted a single run per model due to computational demands, which might not capture the full variability of LLM responses.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** GraphArena is primarily applicable for evaluating LLMs' algorithmic reasoning and planning capabilities on discrete graph structures, particularly for problems requiring systematic traversal, search, and optimization. It highlights LLMs' current limitations in handling complex, large-scale graph computations and their tendency to hallucinate infeasible solutions.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** GraphArena significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in LLM evaluation by providing a more realistic, comprehensive, and rigorously evaluated benchmark for graph computational problems. It moves beyond superficial evaluations to probe genuine reasoning and planning abilities.\n    *   **Identification of Key Weaknesses:** The benchmark clearly identifies critical weaknesses in current LLMs, such as their struggle with meta-algorithmic planning, high hallucination rates on complex tasks, and sensitivity to graph size, even for top-tier models.\n    *   **Guidance for Future Research:** The exploration of improvement strategies offers concrete directions for future research, highlighting the potential of code generation and the limitations of simpler prompting techniques and instruction tuning for complex graph reasoning. It also suggests LLMs could serve as alternative heuristics for NP tasks, complementing existing approximation methods.\n    *   **Open-Source Contribution:** The open-sourcing of GraphArena (problems, responses, and codebase) provides a valuable resource for the research community to foster reproducible and comparable advancements in LLM graph reasoning.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to hallucinate, whereby they generate plausible but inaccurate text. This phenomenon poses significant risks in critical applications, such as medicine or law, necessitating robust hallucination mitigation strategies. While recent works have proposed fine-tuning methods to teach LLMs to abstain from answering questions beyond their knowledge or capabilities, these methods rely on the existence of ground-truth labels or are limited to short-form responses. To address these limitations, we propose fine-tuning using semantic entropy, an uncertainty measure derived from introspection into the model which does not require external labels. We demonstrate that our approach matches or outperforms models fine-tuned using prior work and achieves strong performance for both short and long-form generations on a range of datasets.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination (generating plausible but inaccurate text), which poses significant risks in critical applications (e.g., medicine, law). While fine-tuning LLMs to abstain from answering questions beyond their knowledge is a promising mitigation strategy, existing methods suffer from two key limitations:\n        1.  They often rely on the availability of ground-truth labels, which are difficult or costly to obtain and can be noisy.\n        2.  They are typically limited to short-form responses, failing to account for the lexical and syntactical variations inherent in longer generations.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge:** Mitigating hallucinations is crucial for ensuring the safety, trustworthiness, and overall reliability of LLMs, especially as they are increasingly deployed in high-stakes real-world scenarios. Developing a label-free and versatile abstention mechanism applicable to diverse generation lengths is a significant challenge.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** This work builds upon existing hallucination mitigation strategies, particularly those involving uncertainty estimation and abstention fine-tuning.

This approach is label-free and robust to variations in generation length.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:**\n        *   **Semantic Entropy for Abstention:** Unlike R-Tuning-U which uses classical entropy over raw token sequences, \\cite{tjandra2024umq} computes entropy over the *semantic space* of model generations. This makes the uncertainty measure robust to lexical and syntactical variations, allowing it to accurately indicate hallucinations in both short-form and long-form generations. Semantic equivalence is operationalized using question-dependent bi-directional entailment to cluster responses.\n        *   **Label-Free Fine-Tuning:** The method constructs a training dataset by partitioning questions based on their computed semantic entropy. High-entropy questions are assigned an \"abstain\" label (\"I don't know the answer.\"), while low-entropy questions retain the model's standard response. The model is then fine-tuned using supervised learning with cross-entropy loss.\n        *   **Accuracy-Engagement Distance (AED):** A novel evaluation metric is introduced \\cite{tjandra2024umq} that holistically quantifies model hallucination by considering both accuracy and *engagement* (the number of questions a model willingly answers). AED is a normalized Euclidean distance from an ideal model (max accuracy, max engagement), penalizing models that abstain too frequently or inaccurately.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithm/Method:** A novel fine-tuning approach for LLMs that enables abstention based on *semantic entropy*, providing a label-free and robust mechanism for hallucination mitigation applicable to both short-form and long-form generations \\cite{tjandra2024umq}.\n    *   **Novel Evaluation Metric:** The introduction of the Accuracy-Engagement Distance (AED) \\cite{tjandra2024umq}, a more comprehensive metric for evaluating abstention-capable models by balancing accuracy with the willingness to answer.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** The proposed method was evaluated on LLAMA-3-8B-INSTRUCT across four datasets (TriviaQA, BioASQ, NQ, SQuAD) in a closed-book setting. Experiments covered two answering settings: Long-QA (free-form) and Short-QA (short answers). The method was compared against R-Tuning (label-dependent) and R-Tuning-U (label-independent, classical entropy) \\cite{zhang2024r}. Semantic entropy was computed using two different entailment models (DeBERTa and Llama-3-70B-Instruct).\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results:**\n        *   The method using semantic entropy (SE) matched or outperformed models fine-tuned with R-Tuning and R-Tuning-U \\cite{tjandra2024umq}.\n        *   It achieved a significant reduction in hallucination rates: up to **30.1% for long-form generations** and up to **8.7% for short-form generations** compared to R-Tuning and R-Tuning-U.\n        *   The AED metric effectively demonstrated the improved balance between accuracy and engagement of the proposed method, penalizing models with low engagement that would otherwise appear equivalent based solely on accuracy.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The effectiveness of semantic entropy relies on the quality and contextual understanding of the underlying entailment model used for semantic clustering. The uncertainty threshold (τ) for partitioning the dataset is a user-defined hyperparameter. Due to resource constraints, LoRA was used for fine-tuning, which might not capture the full potential of full fine-tuning.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The method is demonstrated for factual QA tasks in a closed-book setting. Its label-free nature makes it highly scalable and applicable to a wide range of tasks requiring uncertainty-aware abstention, for both short and long-form text generation.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** This work significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in hallucination mitigation by providing a robust, label-free, and versatile fine-tuning approach for LLM abstention \\cite{tjandra2024umq}. It successfully addresses the critical limitations of prior methods, particularly their reliance on ground-truth labels and restriction to short-form responses.\n    *   **Potential Impact:** The ability to fine-tune LLMs to abstain appropriately without external labels and across diverse generation lengths enhances their trustworthiness and safety in high-stakes applications. The proposed AED metric also offers a more comprehensive evaluation standard for future research in uncertainty-aware LLMs, fostering the development of more reliable and helpful AI systems.",

Existing benchmarks are either manually constructed or are automatic, but lack the ability to evaluate the thought process of LLMs with arbitrary complexity. We contend that utilizing existing relational databases based on the entity-relationship (ER) model is a promising approach for constructing benchmarks as they contain structured knowledge that can be used to question LLMs. Unlike knowledge graphs, which are also used to evaluate LLMs, relational databases have integrity constraints that can be used to better construct complex in-depth questions and verify answers: (1) functional dependencies can be used to pinpoint critical keywords that an LLM must know to properly answer a given question containing certain attribute values; and (2) foreign key constraints can be used to join relations and construct multi-hop questions, which can be arbitrarily long and used to debug intermediate answers. We thus propose ERBench, which uses these integrity constraints to convert any database into an LLM benchmark. ERBench supports continuous evaluation as databases change, multimodal questions, and various prompt engineering techniques. In our experiments, we construct LLM benchmarks using databases of multiple domains and make an extensive comparison of contemporary LLMs. We show how ERBench can properly evaluate any LLM by not only checking for answer correctness, but also effectively verifying the rationales by looking for the right keywords.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations, e.g., factually incorrect information, in their responses. These hallucinations present challenges for LLM-based applications that demand high factual accuracy. Existing hallucination detection methods primarily depend on external resources, which can suffer from issues such as low availability, incomplete coverage, privacy concerns, high latency, low reliability, and poor scalability. There are also methods depending on output probabilities, which are often inaccessible for closed-source LLMs like GPT models. This paper presents MetaQA, a self-contained hallucination detection approach that leverages metamorphic relation and prompt mutation. Unlike existing methods, MetaQA operates without any external resources and is compatible with both open-source and closed-source LLMs.\n \n \n \nMetaQA is based on the hypothesis that if an LLM’s response is a hallucination, the designed metamorphic relations will be violated. We compare MetaQA with the state-of-the-art zero-resource hallucination detection method, SelfCheckGPT, across multiple datasets, and on two open-source and two closed-source LLMs. Our results reveal that MetaQA outperforms SelfCheckGPT in terms of precision, recall, and f1 score. For the four LLMs we study, MetaQA outperforms SelfCheckGPT with a superiority margin ranging from 0.041 - 0.113 (for precision), 0.143 - 0.430 (for recall), and 0.154 - 0.368 (for F1-score).

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are useful tools with the capacity for performing specific types of knowledge work at an effective scale. However, LLM deployments in high-risk and safety-critical domains pose unique challenges, notably the issue of ``hallucination,'' where LLMs can generate fabricated information. This is particularly concerning in settings such as drug safety, where inaccuracies could lead to patient harm. To mitigate these risks, we have developed and demonstrated a proof of concept suite of guardrails specifically designed to mitigate certain types of hallucinations and errors for drug safety, and potentially applicable to other medical safety-critical contexts. These guardrails include mechanisms to detect anomalous documents to prevent the ingestion of inappropriate data, identify incorrect drug names or adverse event terms, and convey uncertainty in generated content. We integrated these guardrails with an LLM fine-tuned for a text-to-text task, which involves converting both structured and unstructured data within adverse event reports into natural language. This method was applied to translate individual case safety reports, demonstrating effective application in a pharmacovigilance processing task. Our guardrail framework offers a set of tools with broad applicability across various domains, ensuring LLMs can be safely used in high-risk situations by eliminating the occurrence of key errors, including the generation of incorrect pharmacovigilance-related terms, thus adhering to stringent regulatory and quality standards in medical safety-critical environments.",

        "abstract": "Generation of plausible but incorrect factual information, often termed hallucination, has attracted significant research interest. Retrieval-augmented language model (RALM) -- which enhances models with up-to-date knowledge -- emerges as a promising method to reduce hallucination. However, existing RALMs may instead exacerbate hallucination when retrieving lengthy contexts. To address this challenge, we propose COFT, a novel \\textbf{CO}arse-to-\\textbf{F}ine highligh\\textbf{T}ing method to focus on different granularity-level key texts, thereby avoiding getting lost in lengthy contexts. Specifically, COFT consists of three components: \\textit{recaller}, \\textit{scorer}, and \\textit{selector}. First, \\textit{recaller} applies a knowledge graph to extract potential key entities in a given context. Second, \\textit{scorer} measures the importance of each entity by calculating its contextual weight. Finally, \\textit{selector} selects high contextual weight entities with a dynamic threshold algorithm and highlights the corresponding paragraphs, sentences, or words in a coarse-to-fine manner.

        "abstract": "Although Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated exceptional abilities in understanding multimodal data, they invariably suffer from hallucinations, leading to a disconnect between the generated text and the corresponding images. Almost all current visual contrastive decoding methods attempt to mitigate these hallucinations by introducing visual uncertainty information that appropriately widens the contrastive logits gap between hallucinatory and targeted ones. However, due to uncontrollable nature of the global visual uncertainty, they struggle to precisely induce the hallucinatory tokens, which severely limits their effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and may even lead to the generation of undesired hallucinations. To tackle this issue, we conducted the theoretical analysis to promote the effectiveness of contrast decoding. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel optimization strategy named Hallucination-Induced Optimization (HIO). This strategy seeks to amplify the contrast between hallucinatory and targeted tokens relying on a fine-tuned theoretical preference model (i.e., Contrary Bradley-Terry Model), thereby facilitating efficient contrast decoding to alleviate hallucinations in LVLMs. Extensive experimental research demonstrates that our HIO strategy can effectively reduce hallucinations in LVLMs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) invariably suffer from \"hallucinations,\" where generated text disconnects from the corresponding images, leading to imagined objects, fabricated scenes, incorrect spatial relationships, and misidentified categories \\cite{chen20247jb}.\n    *   This problem is critical as it undermines the reliability and trustworthiness of LVLMs, despite their exceptional multimodal comprehension and reasoning abilities \\cite{chen20247jb}.\n    *   Existing visual contrastive decoding methods, which attempt to mitigate hallucinations by introducing global visual uncertainty, are limited by their inability to precisely induce specific hallucinatory tokens, often leading to unsatisfactory or even undesired hallucinatory outputs \\cite{chen20247jb}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   Previous efforts include post-hoc correction, self-correcting frameworks, and various decoding strategies that integrate visual uncertainty or textual/visual priors \\cite{chen20247jb}.\n    *   Methods like introducing Gaussian noise or substantial image noise into visual inputs (e.g., Leng et al. [2023], Zhang et al. [2024], Favero et al. [2024]) aim to amplify hallucinatory effects \\cite{chen20247jb}.\n    *   **Limitations of previous solutions:** The \"uncontrollable nature of global visual uncertainty\" prevents precise induction of hallucinatory tokens, severely limiting effectiveness and potentially generating new, undesired hallucinations \\cite{chen20247jb}. Traditional Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) also doesn't reliably induce hallucinations in the specific manner required for effective contrastive decoding \\cite{chen20247jb}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Method:** Hallucination-Induced Optimization (HIO) \\cite{chen20247jb}. HIO operates in two phases: a training stage to create an \"Evil LVLM\" by inducing hallucinations, and an inference stage where logits from this \"Evil LVLM\" are contrasted with the original LVLM to reduce hallucinations \\cite{chen20247jb}.\n    *   **Contrary Bradley-Terry Model (CBTM):** Instead of training a model to prefer non-hallucinatory outputs, HIO utilizes a *reversed* Bradley-Terry model. This trains the \"Evil LVLM\" to *prioritize* hallucinatory content by amplifying the logits of hallucinatory tokens and reducing those of correct tokens, which is then used for contrastive decoding \\cite{chen20247jb}.\n    *   **Amplification of Multiple Targeted Hallucination (AMTH):** Addresses the limitation of single-hallucination focus by simultaneously fitting multiple pairs of preference data. This ensures that the \"Evil LVLM\" amplifies a diverse set of potential hallucinations relative to the target tokens, as required by their theoretical analysis (Eqn. 17) \\cite{chen20247jb}.\n    *   **Acquisition of Multiple Candidate Hallucinations:** Proposes a novel data acquisition method where the model directly outputs high-confidence tokens as negative (hallucinatory) samples, supplemented by true value-labeled data for correction \\cite{chen20247jb}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Theoretical Analysis:** A comprehensive theoretical analysis exploring mechanisms to enhance the effectiveness of contrast decoding, leading to insights like the necessity of consistent logit differences between potential hallucinated and correct tokens (Eqn. 17) \\cite{chen20247jb}.\n    *   **Hallucination-Induced Optimization (HIO):** A novel optimization strategy that leverages a fine-tuned theoretical preference model (CBTM) to intensify the contrast between hallucinatory and target tokens, thereby strengthening contrast decoding \\cite{chen20247jb}.\n    *   **Contrary Bradley-Terry Model (CBTM):** An innovative application of the Bradley-Terry model in a \"reversed\" manner to specifically induce and amplify hallucinations in a controlled way for the purpose of contrastive decoding \\cite{chen20247jb}.\n    *   **Amplification of Multiple Targeted Hallucination (AMTH):** A method for simultaneously training against multiple potential hallucination tokens, moving beyond single-hallucination focus to create a more robust \"Evil LVLM\" \\cite{chen20247jb}.\n    *   **Novel Data Acquisition:** A practical approach for generating multiple candidate hallucinations by allowing the model to output high-confidence tokens as negative samples \\cite{chen20247jb}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** Extensive experimental research was performed to evaluate the HIO strategy \\cite{chen20247jb}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics:** The paper mentions using CHAIR metrics (CHAIRs and CHAIRi) to evaluate hallucination reduction \\cite{chen20247jb}.\n    *   **Comparison Results:** HIO demonstrates superior performance, generating descriptions with fewer hallucination tokens and achieving lower scores on CHAIRs and CHAIRi metrics compared to other visual contrastive decoding methods \\cite{chen20247jb}. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks \\cite{chen20247jb}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   The reliance on a \"fine-tuned theoretical preference model\" implies the need for preference data, which can be costly or complex to acquire \\cite{chen20247jb}.\n    *   The proposed method for \"Acquisition of Multiple Candidate Hallucinations\" acknowledges that it \"may incorrectly classify some correct tokens as hallucinations,\" requiring \"true value-labeled data for correction and supplementation\" \\cite{chen20247jb}.\n    *   The scope is focused on mitigating hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) through a specific contrastive decoding enhancement \\cite{chen20247jb}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art:** HIO significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in hallucination mitigation for LVLMs by providing a more precise and effective contrastive decoding mechanism than previous methods \\cite{chen20247jb}.\n    *   **Novel Paradigm:** Introduces a novel paradigm of \"hallucination-induced optimization\" where a model is intentionally trained to generate hallucinations (the \"Evil LVLM\") to then be used as a contrastive baseline, offering a fresh perspective on tackling the problem \\cite{chen20247jb}.\n    *   **Theoretical Foundation:** Provides a strong theoretical foundation (Eqn. 17) for understanding and improving contrast decoding, which can guide future research \\cite{chen20247jb}.\n    *   **Potential Impact:** Could lead to more reliable and trustworthy LVLM applications by reducing factual inconsistencies, and inspire new research directions in controlled adversarial training or preference-based optimization for mitigating other undesirable model behaviors \\cite{chen20247jb}.",

        "abstract": "Large audio-language models (LALMs) enhance traditional large language models by integrating audio perception capabilities, allowing them to tackle audio-related tasks. Previous research has primarily focused on assessing the performance of LALMs across various tasks, yet overlooking their reliability, particularly concerning issues like object hallucination. In our study, we introduce methods to assess the extent of object hallucination of publicly available LALMs. Our findings reveal that LALMs are comparable to specialized audio captioning models in their understanding of audio content, but struggle to answer discriminative questions, specifically those requiring the identification of the presence of particular object sounds within an audio clip. This limitation highlights a critical weakness in current LALMs: their inadequate understanding of discriminative queries. Moreover, we explore the potential of prompt engineering to enhance LALMs' performance on discriminative questions.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review:\n\n### Technical Paper Analysis: Understanding Sounds, Missing the Questions: The Challenge of Object Hallucination in Large Audio-Language Models \\cite{kuan20249pm}\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific technical problem**: The paper addresses the issue of \"object hallucination\" in Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs), where models generate or affirm the presence of objects in audio that are not actually there.\n    *   **Why important and challenging**: LALMs integrate audio perception with Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle diverse audio-related tasks. While previous research has focused on task performance, the reliability of LALMs, particularly concerning hallucination, has been largely overlooked. Hallucination is a known problem in LLMs and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), but there was a lack of discussion and benchmarks for LALMs in the audio domain. This unreliability can lead to incorrect information and reduced trustworthiness in practical applications.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to existing approaches**: LALMs build upon traditional LLMs by adding audio perception capabilities. Existing LALM evaluation benchmarks like Dynamic-SUPERB \\cite{kuan20249pm} and AIR-Bench \\cite{kuan20249pm} primarily assess task performance.\n    *   **Limitations of previous solutions**: These benchmarks do not adequately evaluate the reliability of LALM-generated content, specifically object hallucination. While hallucination has been studied in LLMs and LVLMs (e.g., in image captioning), its prevalence and characteristics in LALMs within speech and audio domains were unexplored, and no specific benchmarks existed to measure it.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core technical method or algorithm**: The paper introduces novel methods to assess object hallucination in LALMs through two main task types:\n        *   **Discriminative Tasks**: Formulated as binary classification (Yes/No) to determine the presence of a specific object's sound. Questions are generated using positive (ground truth) and negative samples (Random, Popular, and Adversarial sampling strategies for non-existent objects). Performance is measured by accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and \"Yes\" answer ratio.\n        *   **Generative Tasks**: Involves audio captioning (e.g., \"Describe the audio\") and noisy Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Nouns are extracted from generated captions using NLP tools (SpaCy \\cite{kuan20249pm}) and compared against ground truth labels to identify hallucinated objects.\n    *   **What makes this approach novel or different**: This is the first work to systematically explore and quantify object hallucination in LALMs. It introduces specific evaluation methodologies and metrics tailored for this problem in the audio domain, including novel negative sampling strategies for discriminative questions and the ECHO (Evaluation of Caption Hallucination in audiO) and Cover metrics for generative tasks. It also explores prompt engineering as a mitigation strategy.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel algorithms, methods, or techniques**:\n        *   Introduction of discriminative and generative evaluation tasks specifically designed to measure object hallucination in LALMs.\n        *   Development of three negative sampling strategies (Random, Popular, Adversarial) for constructing discriminative questions.\n        *   Proposal of ECHO (instance-level ECHO_I and sentence-level ECHO_S) and Cover metrics for quantifying hallucination and coverage in generative audio captioning.\n        *   Investigation into prompt engineering techniques to improve LALM performance on discriminative tasks.\n    *   **Theoretical insights or analysis**: The paper reveals a critical discrepancy: LALMs perform well on audio captioning (generative tasks) but struggle significantly with discriminative questions, indicating a weakness in understanding the *nature* of discriminative queries rather than a fundamental inability to process audio content.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments conducted**:\n        *   Evaluated five publicly available LALMs: Qwen-Audio \\cite{kuan20249pm}, Qwen-Audio-Chat \\cite{kuan20249pm}, LTU-AS-7B \\cite{kuan20249pm}, SALMONN-7B \\cite{kuan20249pm}, and SALMONN-13B \\cite{kuan20249pm}.\n        *   Compared LALMs against a \"Specialized\" cascade pipeline (Whisper-based audio captioning \\cite{kuan20249pm} + ChatGPT \\cite{kuan20249pm} or LLaMA-7b-chat \\cite{kuan20249pm}).\n        *   Used AudioCaps \\cite{kuan20249pm} for audio captioning and CHIME-6 \\cite{kuan20249pm} for noisy ASR.\n        *   Tested five different prompts for both task types and explored greedy vs. sample decoding strategies.\n        *   Investigated eight different prefix prompts for prompt engineering on discriminative tasks.\n    *   **Key performance metrics and comparison results**:\n        *   **Discriminative Tasks**: LALMs exhibited significantly lower recall than precision, indicating a strong tendency to give affirmative answers (hallucinate). F1 scores decreased with more challenging negative sampling strategies (Adversarial < Popular < Random). LALMs were highly sensitive to prompt design. The \"Specialized\" cascade pipeline significantly outperformed all LALMs in F1 scores, highlighting a substantial gap.\n        *   **Generative Tasks**: LALMs' performance on ECHO and Cover metrics was comparable to specialized Whisper-based caption models, demonstrating their capability in understanding audio information and similar levels of object hallucination in captioning. Greedy decoding generally reduced hallucination in generative tasks.\n        *   **Prompt Engineering**: Specific prefix prompts, particularly those emphasizing careful consideration of the question (e.g., P3, P4, P6, P8), led to significant F1 score improvements for some LALMs (e.g., SALMONN models, Qwen-Audio-Chat-7B), but not universally (e.g., LTU-AS-7B showed degradation).\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical limitations or assumptions**: The study primarily focuses on object hallucination and suggests that LALMs' struggle lies in comprehending discriminative queries rather than processing audio content itself. The effectiveness of prompt engineering was model-dependent.\n    *   **Scope of applicability**: The proposed evaluation methods and insights are directly applicable to assessing and improving the reliability of LALMs in audio captioning and related audio understanding tasks.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **How does this advance the technical state-of-the-art**: This work is the first to systematically identify and quantify object hallucination in LALMs, filling a critical gap in LALM reliability research. It introduces novel and comprehensive evaluation methodologies (discriminative/generative tasks, ECHO/Cover metrics) that can serve as benchmarks for future LALM development. It highlights a crucial weakness in current LALMs regarding their understanding of discriminative queries, even when their audio comprehension is strong.\n    *   **Potential impact on future research**: The findings will guide future LALM research towards developing more robust models that are less prone to hallucination, particularly by focusing on improving query understanding mechanisms. It encourages the development of LALMs that can precisely discriminate information from audio, rather than just generating descriptive captions. The proposed evaluation framework provides a valuable tool for assessing the reliability of new LALM architectures.",

        "abstract": "Mitigating hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) remains an open problem. Recent benchmarks do not address hallucinations in open-ended free-form responses, which we term “Type I hallucinations”. Instead, they focus on hallucinations responding to very specific question formats-typically a multiple-choice response regarding a particular object or attribute-which we term “Type II hallucinations”. Additionally, such benchmarks often require external API calls to models which are subject to change. In practice, we observe that a reduction in Type II hallucinations does not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations but rather that the two forms of halluci-nations are often anti-correlated. To address this, we propose THRONE, a novel object-based automatic framework for quantitatively evaluating Type I hallucinations in LVLM free-form outputs. We use public language models (LMs) to identify hallucinations in LVLM responses and compute informative metrics. By evaluating a large selection of recent LVLMs using public datasets, we show that an improvement in existing metrics do not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations, and that established benchmarks for measuring Type I hallucinations are incomplete. Finally, we provide a simple and effective data augmentation method to reduce Type I and Type II hallucinations as a strong baseline.",

        "abstract": "Hallucinations pose a significant challenge for the practical implementation of large language models (LLMs). The utilization of parametric knowledge in generating factual content is constrained by the limited knowledge of LLMs, potentially resulting in internal hallucinations. While incorporating external information can help fill knowledge gaps, it also introduces the risk of irrelevant information, thereby increasing the likelihood of external hallucinations. A careful and balanced integration of the parametric knowledge within LLMs with external information is crucial to alleviate hallucinations. In this study, we present Rowen, a novel approach that enhances LLMs with a selective retrieval augmentation process tailored to address hallucinated outputs. This process is governed by a multilingual semantic-aware detection module, which evaluates the consistency of the perturbed responses across various languages for the same queries. Upon detecting inconsistencies indicative of hallucinations, Rowen activates the retrieval of external information to rectify the model outputs. Rowen adeptly harmonizes the intrinsic parameters in LLMs with external knowledge sources, effectively mitigating hallucinations by ensuring a balanced integration of internal reasoning and external evidence. Through a comprehensive empirical analysis, we demonstrate that Rowen surpasses the current state-of-the-art in both detecting and mitigating hallucinated content within the outputs of LLMs.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review, emphasizing technical innovations and empirical validation:\n\n### Focused Summary for Literature Review\n\n**1. Research Problem & Motivation**\n*   **Specific Technical Problem:** Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently generate factually incorrect or nonsensical outputs, known as hallucinations. These can be categorized into:\n    *   **Internal Hallucinations:** Arise from LLMs' limited parametric knowledge, especially for recent or domain-specific information \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n    *   **External Hallucinations:** Occur in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems when irrelevant or erroneous external information is incorporated, leading to compromised output accuracy \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n*   **Importance & Challenge:** Hallucinations pose significant risks in practical LLM deployments, undermining trust and reliability. The challenge lies in effectively balancing the utilization of LLMs' internal parametric knowledge with external information to mitigate both types of hallucinations without introducing new errors or unnecessary computational overhead \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n\n**2. Related Work & Positioning**\n*   **Existing Approaches:**\n    *   **Self-improvement methods (e.g., self-reflection, multi-model debate):** Leverage LLMs' parametric knowledge and reasoning capabilities to enhance logical consistency \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n    *   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Integrates external documents to overcome knowledge limitations \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n    *   **Adaptive Retrieval Methods:** Assess question difficulty or response confidence to decide when to retrieve documents \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n*   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n    *   Self-improvement methods are often constrained by LLMs' inherent knowledge boundaries and reasoning chain complexity, leading to internal hallucinations \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n    *   RAG methods are susceptible to external hallucinations due to the risk of incorporating irrelevant evidence, leading to error accumulation \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n    *   Existing consistency-based methods may fail when LLMs provide consistent but incorrect answers, often due to focusing solely on semantic coherence within a single language or model \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n\n**3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n*   **Core Technical Method:** The paper introduces **Rowen** (Retrieve only when it needs), an adaptive retrieval augmentation framework that enhances LLMs by dynamically deciding when to retrieve external information based on a novel consistency-based hallucination detection module \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n*   **Novelty/Differentiation:**\n    *   **Adaptive Retrieval Trigger:** Unlike always-on RAG or simpler confidence-based adaptive methods, Rowen activates retrieval *only* when high uncertainty (inconsistency) is detected in LLM responses, balancing internal reasoning and external evidence \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n    *   **Consistency-based Hallucination Detection:** Rowen's detection module goes beyond single-language/model consistency by evaluating semantic inconsistencies across:\n        *   **Cross-Language (Rowen-CL):** Responses to the same query translated into different languages \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n        *   **Cross-Model (Rowen-CM):** Responses to the same query generated by different LLMs (e.g., a primary model and a verifier model) \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n    *   **Three-Stage Framework:**\n        1.  **Stage 1: Generating Initial Answer:** Uses Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to produce a preliminary response \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n        2.  **Stage 2: Deciding Whether to Retrieve:** Employs the consistency-based detection module (cross-language, cross-model, or hybrid) to assess the reliability of the initial response. If the consistency score falls below a threshold, retrieval is triggered \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n        3.  **Stage 3: Retrieval Augmented Generation:** If retrieval is triggered, relevant external knowledge is searched (e.g., via web search API) and used to repair and refine the initial hallucinated content \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n\n**4. Key Technical Contributions**\n*   **Novel Algorithms/Methods:**\n    *   A novel **consistency-based hallucination detection module** that leverages semantic inconsistencies across diverse language verbalizations and different LLMs (cross-language and cross-model consistency checks) to estimate model uncertainty \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n    *   An **adaptive retrieval strategy** that intelligently decides *when* to engage external knowledge retrieval, thereby mitigating both internal and external hallucinations and optimizing retrieval efficiency \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n*   **System Design/Architectural Innovations:** The Rowen framework integrates CoT reasoning, multi-faceted consistency checking, and targeted retrieval-augmented generation into a cohesive pipeline for robust hallucination mitigation \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n\n**5. Experimental Validation**\n*   **Experiments Conducted:**\n    *   Evaluated on the **TruthfulQA dataset** (generation task) to assess LLMs' ability to produce truthful responses \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n    *   Evaluated on the **StrategyQA dataset** (yes/no questions requiring multi-step reasoning) to assess accuracy \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n    *   Ablation studies and hyperparameter analysis were conducted (details in Appendix D) \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n*   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results:**\n    *   **TruthfulQA:** Rowen achieved a GPT-Judge score of 59.34%, a substantial improvement of +16.74% over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline. It also reported BLEU and Rouge-L scores \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n    *   **StrategyQA:** Rowen achieved an accuracy of 75.60%, surpassing existing self-improvement and RAG-based baselines \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n    *   **Efficiency:** The adaptive retrieval strategy significantly reduced unnecessary retrievals, enhancing the efficiency of RAG systems \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n    *   **Baselines:** Compared against Vanilla LLMs (ChatGPT), Self-improvement methods (CoVe, Multi-agent Debate, Self-Reflection), Retrieval-augmented methods (Factool, Detect-and-Mitigate), and Adaptive retrieval methods (FLARE, Adaptive-Retrieval, Self-RAG, Adaptive-RAG, LUQ) \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n    *   **Implementation Details:** Used ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo) as the primary LLM, Qwen-Max-0428 as the verifier LM for cross-model checks, and Google Search API for retrieval \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n\n**6. Limitations & Scope**\n*   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The paper does not explicitly state limitations of the Rowen framework itself within the provided abstract and introduction. However, potential implicit limitations could include:\n    *   Reliance on the quality of semantic perturbations and translations for consistency checks.\n    *   The effectiveness of the consistency check depends on the chosen verifier model (for Rowen-CM) and the target language (for Rowen-CL).\n    *   The performance is sensitive to hyperparameters like the consistency score threshold and the weight factor `α` for hybrid detection \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n*   **Scope of Applicability:** Rowen is designed for factual question-answering and generation tasks where hallucination mitigation is critical. Its adaptive nature makes it suitable for scenarios where balancing internal knowledge and external retrieval is beneficial for accuracy and efficiency \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n\n**7. Technical Significance**\n*   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** Rowen significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in both detecting and mitigating hallucinations in LLM outputs, as evidenced by its superior performance on TruthfulQA and StrategyQA datasets \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n*   **Potential Impact on Future Research:**\n    *   Introduces a novel paradigm for adaptive retrieval, moving beyond simple confidence scores to multi-faceted consistency checks for uncertainty estimation.\n    *   Highlights the utility of cross-language and cross-model inconsistencies as robust indicators for hallucination detection.\n    *   Provides a framework for more efficient RAG systems by reducing unnecessary retrievals, which can lead to cost savings and faster response times in real-world applications \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n    *   Encourages further research into dynamic, context-aware strategies for integrating parametric and external knowledge in LLMs.",

        "title": "A Unified Hallucination Mitigation Framework for Large Vision-Language Models",
        "abstract": "Hallucination is a common problem for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with long generations which is difficult to eradicate. The generation with hallucinations is partially inconsistent with the image content. To mitigate hallucination, current studies either focus on the process of model inference or the results of model generation, but the solutions they design sometimes do not deal appropriately with various types of queries and the hallucinations of the generations about these queries. To accurately deal with various hallucinations, we present a unified framework, Dentist, for hallucination mitigation. The core step is to first classify the queries, then perform different processes of hallucination mitigation based on the classification result, just like a dentist first observes the teeth and then makes a plan. In a simple deployment, Dentist can classify queries as perception or reasoning and easily mitigate potential hallucinations in answers which has been demonstrated in our experiments. On MMbench, we achieve a 13.44%/10.2%/15.8% improvement in accuracy on Image Quality, a Coarse Perception visual question answering (VQA) task, over the baseline InstructBLIP/LLaVA/VisualGLM.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **1. Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) frequently suffer from \"hallucination,\" where generated content deviates from the actual image content \\cite{chang2024u3t}. This includes both \"perception hallucination\" (incorrectly describing visual attributes) and \"reasoning hallucination\" (producing fallacies in logical reasoning based on the image).\n    *   **Importance & Challenge**: Hallucinations lead to misinformation, degrade user experience, and undermine the reliability of LVLMs. Existing mitigation methods often employ a fixed verification approach, which is ineffective or inappropriate for the diverse types of hallucinations arising from different query types (e.g., object detection is not suitable for reasoning queries). Furthermore, current methods may not fully eradicate hallucinations in a single pass, sometimes leading to inconsistent corrections \\cite{chang2024u3t}.\n\n*   **2. Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Previous work on hallucination mitigation generally falls into two categories: optimizing model training/inference (e.g., RLHF-V, VIGC) or correcting hallucinations during the generation stage without model updates (e.g., Woodpecker, HalluciDoctor) \\cite{chang2024u3t}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Existing methods overlook the diversity of hallucinations. They apply a \"one-size-fits-all\" verification strategy, which is suboptimal for different query types (perception vs. reasoning). For instance, methods relying on object detection are effective for perceptual errors but fail for complex reasoning errors. This fixed approach can lead to partial or inconsistent corrections \\cite{chang2024u3t}.\n\n*   **3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes \"Dentist,\" a unified hallucination mitigation framework for LVLMs. Its core idea is to first classify the query type and then apply a tailored mitigation strategy within a validation loop \\cite{chang2024u3t}.\n        *   **Potential Hallucination Classification**: Queries are classified into \"perception\" or \"reasoning\" using ChatGPT with a specific prompt. This classification determines the type of potential hallucination in the LVLM's answer.\n        *   **Divide-and-Conquer Treatment**:\n            *   **Visual Verification for Perception Queries**: For perception-based queries, the original LVLM's long descriptive answer is broken down into sub-questions by ChatGPT. These sub-questions are then answered by the *original* LVLM (to demonstrate mitigation ability, not just a better VQA model), and the sub-answers are aggregated by ChatGPT to refine the original hallucinated response.\n            *   **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for Reasoning Queries**: For reasoning-based queries, a \"Let’s think step by step\" CoT prompt is added to the original query for the LVLM. ChatGPT then uses the LVLM's CoT-enhanced generation to correct the original answer, providing more detailed logical reasoning.\n        *   **Validation Loop**: The entire verification process is embedded in a loop. The revised answer from one iteration becomes the input for the next. The loop continues until the answer no longer changes significantly semantically (determined by ChatGPT) or a maximum iteration limit is reached, preventing \"snowball errors\" \\cite{chang2024u3t}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**: The novelty lies in being the first to:\n        *   Distinguish and apply different hallucination mitigation treatments based on the classification of potential hallucinations (perception vs. reasoning).\n        *   Employ a validation loop that iteratively refines answers until semantic convergence, ensuring more complete hallucination removal \\cite{chang2024u3t}.\n        *   The framework is designed for easy integration into various LVLMs and allows for future extensions with new classifications and treatments.\n\n*   **4. Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Framework**: Introduction of \"Dentist,\" a unified framework for hallucination classification and mitigation in LVLMs \\cite{chang2024u3t}.\n    *   **Adaptive Mitigation Strategy**: A novel approach that classifies queries (and thus potential hallucinations) into perception or reasoning types and applies tailored mitigation techniques (visual verification with sub-questions for perception, Chain-of-Thought for reasoning).\n    *   **Iterative Refinement**: Implementation of a validation loop that continuously verifies and corrects answers until semantic stability, addressing the issue of incomplete hallucination removal \\cite{chang2024u3t}.\n    *   **System Design**: A modular and easily integrable framework design that can be deployed with various LVLMs and extended with new components.\n\n*   **5. Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Comprehensive quantitative experiments were performed on several hallucination mitigation benchmarks \\cite{chang2024u3t}.\n    *   **Benchmarks**: MMBench (covering Perception and Reasoning abilities), LLaVA-QA90, CHAIR, and POPE.\n    *   **Models Evaluated**: InstructBLIP, LLaVA, and VisualGLM were used as baseline LVLMs.\n    *   **Comparison**: The method was compared against a current effective LVLM hallucination mitigation method, Woodpecker \\cite{chang2024u3t}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Results**:\n        *   Significant improvements were observed across various visual language tasks.\n        *   On the Image Quality task (a Coarse Perception VQA task) within MMBench, \"Dentist\" achieved a 13.44% improvement over InstructBLIP, 10.2% over LLaVA, and 15.8% over VisualGLM in accuracy \\cite{chang2024u3t}.\n        *   The experiments demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in mitigating hallucinations and boosting the performance of baseline LVLMs.\n\n*   **6. Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The framework relies on an external LLM (ChatGPT) for query classification, sub-question generation, answer aggregation, CoT-based correction, and semantic convergence detection. This introduces dependency on the performance and availability of such models. The paper also notes that if the validation loop reaches its maximum iteration limit without semantic convergence, it might indicate a \"snowball error\" phenomenon, in which case only the first verification's answer is returned, implying that not all hallucinations might be fully resolved in such edge cases \\cite{chang2024u3t}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The framework is designed for mitigating perception and reasoning hallucinations in LVLMs. While it is unified for these two types, its direct applicability to other potential hallucination categories (if any exist beyond these two broad types) is not explicitly discussed.\n\n*   **7. Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: \"Dentist\" advances the technical state-of-the-art by introducing a novel, adaptive, and iterative approach to hallucination mitigation, moving beyond fixed verification methods. By classifying query types and tailoring mitigation strategies, it addresses the inherent diversity of hallucinations more effectively than prior work \\cite{chang2024u3t}. The validation loop ensures a more thorough and robust correction process.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: This work provides a strong foundation for future research in several areas:\n        *   Developing more sophisticated query classification mechanisms.\n        *   Exploring additional specialized mitigation strategies for finer-grained hallucination types.\n        *   Investigating alternative methods for semantic convergence detection in iterative correction loops.\n        *   Improving the robustness of LVLMs by integrating such adaptive post-hoc correction frameworks, leading to more reliable and trustworthy multimodal AI systems \\cite{chang2024u3t}.",

        "title": "Investigating and Mitigating the Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing in Large Vision-Language Models",
        "abstract": "Though advanced in understanding visual information with human languages, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) still suffer from multimodal hallucinations. A natural concern is that during multimodal interaction, the generated hallucinations could influence the LVLMs' subsequent generation. Thus, we raise a question: When presented with a query relevant to the previously generated hallucination, will LVLMs be misled and respond incorrectly, even though the ground visual information exists? To answer this, we propose a framework called MMHalSnowball to evaluate LVLMs' behaviors when encountering generated hallucinations, where LVLMs are required to answer specific visual questions within a curated hallucinatory conversation. Crucially, our experiment shows that the performance of open-source LVLMs drops by at least $31\\%$, indicating that LVLMs are prone to accept the generated hallucinations and make false claims that they would not have supported without distractions. We term this phenomenon Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing. To mitigate this, we further propose a training-free method called Residual Visual Decoding, where we revise the output distribution of LVLMs with the one derived from the residual visual input, providing models with direct access to the visual information. Experiments show that our method can mitigate more than $24\\%$ of the snowballed multimodal hallucination while maintaining capabilities.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are susceptible to multimodal hallucinations, where their generated responses contradict visual information \\cite{zhong2024mfi}.\n    *   A critical, yet underexplored, problem is whether these generated hallucinations can \"snowball,\" influencing an LVLM's subsequent generations and leading to further incorrect responses, even when ground visual information is available. This phenomenon, termed \"Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing,\" is important because it undermines the reliability of LVLMs in interactive, conversational settings.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   Previous research has identified similar \"snowballing\" effects in Large Language Models (LLMs), where models over-commit to early mistakes, leading to accumulated errors in conversational contexts \\cite{zhong2024mfi}.\n    *   However, this paper highlights that the extent to which *multimodal* hallucinations accumulate and mislead LVLMs into generating false claims had not been systematically investigated prior to this work \\cite{zhong2024mfi}. This work positions itself as the first to conduct such an investigation.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **MMHalSnowball Framework**: \\cite{zhong2024mfi} proposes a novel framework to systematically evaluate multimodal hallucination snowballing. It constructs curated hallucinatory visual conversations where LVLMs are first prompted to describe an image, and if a hallucination is observed, a subsequent question relevant to that hallucination is posed. The framework compares LVLM performance in these hallucinatory conversations against hallucination-free contexts.\n    *   **Hallucination Creation**: The framework meticulously creates hallucinations by categorizing them into Existence, Attribute, Relation, and Imagination types. It uses ChatGPT to rewrite facts and generate image descriptions that semantically entail a specific hallucination, ensuring the hallucinated information directly contradicts the visual ground truth and invalidates the correct answer to a target question.\n    *   **Residual Visual Decoding (RVD)**: To mitigate snowballing, \\cite{zhong2024mfi} introduces a training-free decoding method. RVD works by \"residual connecting\" the visual information with the current user instruction. This process derives output distributions that emphasize direct visual evidence, which are then used to revise the LVLM's original output distribution, providing models with more direct access to visual information during generation.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Identification and Characterization of Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing**: The paper formally identifies and defines this novel phenomenon, demonstrating how LVLMs can be misled by their own previously generated hallucinations \\cite{zhong2024mfi}.\n    *   **MMHalSnowball Evaluation Framework**: A systematic framework for constructing hallucinatory visual conversations and evaluating LVLMs' susceptibility to snowballing, including a detailed methodology for hallucination creation and allocation across different types \\cite{zhong2024mfi}.\n    *   **Residual Visual Decoding (RVD)**: A novel, training-free decoding method designed to mitigate multimodal hallucination snowballing by integrating residual visual input to revise output distributions \\cite{zhong2024mfi}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Models Tested**: Experiments were conducted on prominent open-source LVLMs, including GPT-4V, LLaVA 1.5, and mPLUG-Owl2 \\cite{zhong2024mfi}.\n    *   **Dataset**: The validation set of the GQA dataset, augmented with regional descriptions from Visual Genome, was used as the data source to ensure objective perceptional questions and minimize dataset contamination \\cite{zhong2024mfi}.\n    *   **Key Findings on Snowballing**: The experiments revealed that the performance of open-source LVLMs dropped by at least 31% when exposed to hallucinatory conversational contexts compared to hallucination-free conversations. Specifically, over 59% of answers were semantically aligned with previously generated hallucinations, indicating models were misled \\cite{zhong2024mfi}.\n    *   **RVD Performance**: Residual Visual Decoding demonstrated significant mitigation, reducing snowballed multimodal hallucinations by more than 24% while successfully maintaining the models' contextual modeling capabilities \\cite{zhong2024mfi}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   The study primarily focuses on specific types of hallucinations (Existence, Attribute, Relation, Imagination) and their impact in a question-answering conversational setting \\cite{zhong2024mfi}.\n    *   While the MMHalSnowball framework is systematic, the hallucination creation process relies on ChatGPT, which introduces a dependency on another LLM's capabilities \\cite{zhong2024mfi}.\n    *   The RVD method is training-free, which is an advantage, but its generalizability across all possible LVLM architectures and tasks beyond conversational QA needs further exploration.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   This paper significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by being the first to systematically investigate and quantify the \"Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing\" phenomenon in LVLMs \\cite{zhong2024mfi}.\n    *   The proposed MMHalSnowball framework provides a robust methodology for future research to evaluate LVLM robustness against self-generated errors.\n    *   The introduction of Residual Visual Decoding offers a practical, training-free mitigation strategy, paving the way for more reliable and trustworthy LVLM interactions, particularly in safety-critical applications \\cite{zhong2024mfi}.

        "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance in their ability to write human-like text, a key challenge remains around their tendency to hallucinate generating content that appears factual but is ungrounded. This issue of hallucination is arguably the biggest hindrance to safely deploying these powerful LLMs into real-world production systems that impact people's lives. The journey toward widespread adoption of LLMs in practical settings heavily relies on addressing and mitigating hallucinations. Unlike traditional AI systems focused on limited tasks, LLMs have been exposed to vast amounts of online text data during training. While this allows them to display impressive language fluency, it also means they are capable of extrapolating information from the biases in training data, misinterpreting ambiguous prompts, or modifying the information to align superficially with the input. This becomes hugely alarming when we rely on language generation capabilities for sensitive applications, such as summarizing medical records, financial analysis reports, etc. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of over 32 techniques developed to mitigate hallucination in LLMs. Notable among these are Retrieval Augmented Generation (Lewis et al, 2021), Knowledge Retrieval (Varshney et al,2023), CoNLI (Lei et al, 2023), and CoVe (Dhuliawala et al, 2023). Furthermore, we introduce a detailed taxonomy categorizing these methods based on various parameters, such as dataset utilization, common tasks, feedback mechanisms, and retriever types. This classification helps distinguish the diverse approaches specifically designed to tackle hallucination issues in LLMs. Additionally, we analyze the challenges and limitations inherent in these techniques, providing a solid foundation for future research in addressing hallucinations and related phenomena within the realm of LLMs.",

        "title": "Knowledge Overshadowing Causes Amalgamated Hallucination in Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "Hallucination is often regarded as a major impediment for using large language models (LLMs), especially for knowledge-intensive tasks. Even when the training corpus consists solely of true statements, language models still generate hallucinations in the form of amalgamations of multiple facts. We coin this phenomenon as ``knowledge overshadowing'': when we query knowledge from a language model with multiple conditions, some conditions overshadow others, leading to hallucinated outputs. This phenomenon partially stems from training data imbalance, which we verify on both pretrained models and fine-tuned models, over a wide range of LM model families and sizes.From a theoretical point of view, knowledge overshadowing can be interpreted as over-generalization of the dominant conditions (patterns). We show that the hallucination rate grows with both the imbalance ratio (between the popular and unpopular condition) and the length of dominant condition description, consistent with our derived generalization bound. Finally, we propose to utilize overshadowing conditions as a signal to catch hallucination before it is produced, along with a training-free self-contrastive decoding method to alleviate hallucination during inference. Our proposed approach showcases up to 82% F1 for hallucination anticipation and 11.2% to 39.4% hallucination control, with different models and datasets.",

This progression can be understood through two major, intertwined trends: an initial focus on **evaluating and attributing factual correctness** that quickly matured into **proactive, real-time mitigation strategies**, alongside a simultaneous drive towards **comprehensive mechanistic understanding and categorization** of the hallucination phenomenon itself.\n\n*Trend 1: From Post-hoc Attribution and Evaluation to Real-time, Proactive Mitigation*\n\nThe journey began with the recognition that LLM outputs lacked trustworthiness and verifiability due to factual inaccuracies. \"[gao2023ht7] Enabling Large Language Models to Generate Text with Citations (2023)\" addressed this by proposing a solution centered on **attribution and evaluation**. Their core innovation was the **ALCE benchmark**, the first reproducible and automatically evaluable framework for assessing an LLM's ability to generate text with verifiable citations. This represented a significant methodological progression from qualitative assessment to standardized, quantitative measurement of a specific hallucination mitigation strategy. ALCE introduced novel NLI-based metrics for fluency, correctness, and, crucially, citation quality, allowing for systematic comparison of prompting strategies and LLM capabilities. However, [gao2023ht7]'s empirical analysis also highlighted inherent limitations in current LLMs, such as retrieval quality, context window constraints, and difficulties in multi-document synthesis, implying that merely providing citations *after* generation might not be sufficient to prevent or correct errors.\n\nThis insight paved the way for more dynamic, in-generation approaches. \"[kang202378c] Ever: Mitigating Hallucination in Large Language Models through Real-Time Verification and Rectification (2023)\" directly tackled the \"snowballing\" problem—the propagation and accumulation of factual errors in long-form generation—a limitation that post-hoc methods could not adequately address. EVER introduced a novel **real-time, step-wise verification and rectification framework** that operates at a fine-grained, concept-level *during* the generation process. This marked a significant methodological shift from post-generation checking to **proactive intervention**. Key innovations included dynamic rectification strategies tailored for intrinsic (contradictory) versus extrinsic (unverifiable) hallucinations and the ability to leverage EVER-rectified data for preference tuning, further enhancing LLM factuality. EVER's ability to prevent error propagation and transparently flag unverified content represented a substantial leap in building more trustworthy and factually accurate LLM systems.\n\n*Trend 2: From Problem Identification to Mechanistic Understanding and Comprehensive Categorization*\n\nConcurrently with the development of practical mitigation techniques, there was a critical need to systematically define, categorize, and understand the multifaceted nature of LLM hallucination. \"[zhang2023k1j] Siren's Song in the AI Ocean: A Survey on Hallucination in Large Language Models (2023)\" served as a foundational effort in this direction. It addressed the problem of a fragmented understanding by providing a **comprehensive survey** that defined and categorized hallucination into input-conflicting, context-conflicting, and fact-conflicting types. This was a crucial conceptual innovation, offering a common taxonomy and an analytical framework for understanding hallucination sources and mitigation strategies across the entire LLM lifecycle. While it reviewed existing benchmarks, its primary contribution was to structure the problem space, providing a much-needed conceptual map for the rapidly evolving field.\n\nBuilding upon this initial categorization, \"[ye2023yom] Cognitive Mirage: A Review of Hallucinations in Large Language Models (2023)\" deepened the mechanistic analysis and broadened the categorization. While [zhang2023k1j] provided a general taxonomy, [ye2023yom] introduced a **novel, detailed taxonomy categorized by various text generation tasks** (e.g., Machine Translation, QA, Dialog, Summarization). More profoundly, it provided **in-depth theoretical and mechanistic analyses** of hallucination origins, attributing them to three primary factors: data collection, knowledge gaps, and the optimization process. This represented a significant methodological progression from general categorization to a granular, task-specific, and mechanistic understanding of *why* hallucinations occur. Its key innovation was consolidating fragmented research into a coherent theoretical framework, offering a roadmap for future research by identifying root causes and proposing concrete directions for improvement.\n\n3. *Synthesis*\n\nThis chain of works collectively traces the rapid maturation of research into LLM hallucination, moving from initial efforts to evaluate and attribute factual claims to developing sophisticated real-time correction mechanisms, all underpinned by an evolving, comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon's diverse manifestations and underlying causes. Their collective contribution is establishing a robust scientific foundation—encompassing benchmarks, taxonomies, mechanistic analyses, and proactive solutions—essential for building truly trustworthy and reliable large language models."

This trajectory highlights a field rapidly maturing from broad problem statements to granular analysis and targeted methodological advancements.\n\n**Trend 1: From General RAG Concept to Granular Diagnostic and Systematic Categorization of Solutions**\n\nThe initial motivation for RAG stemmed from the inherent limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), primarily their propensity for hallucination, reliance on outdated training data, and a general lack of transparency in their generated outputs. RAG emerged as a promising paradigm to address these issues by dynamically grounding LLM responses in external, up-to-date knowledge. However, the early implementations, often referred to as \"Naive RAG,\" quickly revealed their own set of challenges, including poor retrieval precision and difficulties in coherent generation, as acknowledged by [gao20232zb] in \"Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models: A Survey\" (2023).\n\nThe research then progressed to a more granular understanding of *why* RAG-augmented LLMs still struggled. [chen2023h04] in \"Benchmarking Large Language Models in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\" (2023) made a pivotal contribution by shifting the focus from general RAG performance to a diagnostic evaluation of LLMs' fundamental abilities when interacting with retrieved information. This paper addressed the significant problem of a lack of rigorous, systematic evaluation that could pinpoint specific bottlenecks in LLMs' RAG capabilities. Previous RAG evaluations often relied on general QA datasets, failing to capture the nuances of how LLMs process external, potentially noisy or conflicting, information.\n\n[chen2023h04]'s key innovation was the introduction of the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation Benchmark (RGB)**. This novel, multi-lingual corpus was specifically designed with four distinct testbeds, each tailored to evaluate a crucial RAG ability: Noise Robustness, Negative Rejection, Information Integration, and Counterfactual Robustness. By constructing data instances using the latest news and LLM-generated QA, the benchmark effectively mitigated internal knowledge bias, ensuring a focused assessment of RAG's true impact. The empirical findings were stark: LLMs, even with RAG, exhibited significant shortcomings. They struggled with noise, often confusing similar information; frequently failed to reject answering when no relevant information was present; demonstrated a profound lack of ability to synthesize facts from multiple documents; and, critically, tended to prioritize factually incorrect retrieved information even when explicitly warned about potential risks. This work provided concrete evidence of the specific failure modes of RAG-augmented LLMs, pushing the field to understand *where* and *how* RAG systems needed to improve beyond simple retrieval.\n\nBuilding upon this deepened understanding of RAG's complexities and limitations, [gao20232zb]'s survey then provided a comprehensive framework for understanding the methodological progression and solutions being developed. While not presenting new experimental results, this paper's innovation lies in its systematic categorization of RAG's evolution into three paradigms: **Naive RAG, Advanced RAG, and Modular RAG**. It addressed the problem of a rapidly evolving and fragmented RAG landscape by offering a structured overview, detailing how the field has moved from a basic \"Retrieve-Read\" chain to increasingly sophisticated architectures. The survey meticulously outlined the technical approaches and innovations within Advanced RAG, such as pre-retrieval strategies (refined indexing, query optimization) and post-retrieval processes (re-ranking, context compression), which are direct responses to issues like poor retrieval precision and noise handling implicitly highlighted by [chen2023h04].\n\nThe most significant architectural innovation surveyed by [gao20232zb] is **Modular RAG**. This paradigm introduces specialized functional modules (e.g., Search, RAG-Fusion, Memory, Routing) and flexible interaction patterns (e.g., iterative/adaptive retrieval flows like FLARE and Self-RAG). These advancements represent the community's efforts to create more adaptable, robust, and intelligent RAG systems capable of addressing the very challenges identified by benchmarks like RGB – for instance, improving information integration through multi-query and iterative retrieval, or enhancing counterfactual robustness through more sophisticated reasoning and routing mechanisms. The survey thus serves as a crucial research roadmap, synthesizing current challenges and prospective avenues for RAG innovation, directly informed by the empirical insights into RAG's limitations.\n\n3.  *Synthesis*:\n    The unified intellectual trajectory connecting these works is the continuous drive to enhance the reliability and factual accuracy of Large Language Models through Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Collectively, they advance the understanding of \"Hallucination in Large Language Models\" by first providing a granular, diagnostic framework to empirically identify specific RAG-related failure modes in LLMs ([chen2023h04]), and then by systematically categorizing the architectural and methodological evolution of RAG systems designed to overcome these and other inherent LLM limitations ([gao20232zb]).",

        "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising approach for mitigating the hallucination of large language models (LLMs). However, existing research lacks rigorous evaluation of the impact of retrieval-augmented generation on different large language models, which make it challenging to identify the potential bottlenecks in the capabilities of RAG for different LLMs. In this paper, we systematically investigate the impact of Retrieval-Augmented Generation on large language models. We analyze the performance of different large language models in 4 fundamental abilities required for RAG, including noise robustness, negative rejection, information integration, and counterfactual robustness. To this end, we establish Retrieval-Augmented Generation Benchmark (RGB), a new corpus for RAG evaluation in both English and Chinese. RGB divides the instances within the benchmark into 4 separate testbeds based on the aforementioned fundamental abilities required to resolve the case. Then we evaluate 6 representative LLMs on RGB to diagnose the challenges of current LLMs when applying RAG. Evaluation reveals that while LLMs exhibit a certain degree of noise robustness, they still struggle significantly in terms of negative rejection, information integration, and dealing with false information. The aforementioned assessment outcomes indicate that there is still a considerable journey ahead to effectively apply RAG to LLMs.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review, emphasizing technical innovations and empirical validation:\n\n*   **1.

Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: The authors evaluated 6 state-of-the-art LLMs (ChatGPT, ChatGLM-6B, ChatGLM2-6B, Vicuna-7b, Qwen-7B-Chat, BELLE-7B) on the RGB benchmark \\cite{chen2023h04}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   **Noise Robustness**: LLMs showed *some* robustness but often confused similar information (e.g., 2021 vs. 2022 Nobel Prize), leading to inaccurate answers when relevant information was present alongside noise.\n        *   **Negative Rejection**: LLMs frequently failed to reject answering when no relevant information was available, instead generating incorrect responses.\n        *   **Information Integration**: LLMs demonstrated a significant lack of ability to synthesize information from multiple documents to answer complex questions.\n        *   **Counterfactual Robustness**: Even when LLMs possessed the correct internal knowledge and were explicitly warned about potential risks in retrieved information, they tended to trust and prioritize the factually incorrect retrieved information \\cite{chen2023h04}.\n        *   **Overall**: While RAG can improve LLM accuracy, current models still struggle significantly with these fundamental challenges, indicating substantial room for improvement.\n\n*   **6. Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**: The evaluation of Counterfactual Robustness specifically focuses on scenarios where LLMs are *given warnings* about potential risks in retrieved information, which might not cover all real-world counterfactual scenarios. The definition of \"noisy documents\" is specific to documents relevant to the question but lacking the answer.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The benchmark and findings are primarily applicable to RAG systems where external documents are retrieved from web sources (simulated via Search API) and LLMs are used for generation.

    "seed_title": "Hallucination is Inevitable: An Innate Limitation of Large Language Models",
    "summary": "\n2. *Evolution Analysis:*\n\n*Trend 1: The Paradigm Shift from Empirical Mitigation to Theoretical Inevitability*\n\n- *Methodological progression*: The research landscape surrounding hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) has undergone a significant methodological transformation. Prior to the work presented in \"[xu2024n76] Hallucination is Inevitable: An Innate Limitation of Large Language Models (2024)\", the field was largely characterized by empirical approaches. Researchers focused on identifying the practical sources of hallucination—such as issues in data collection, training processes, or inference mechanisms—and subsequently developing engineering-focused mitigation strategies. These included designing factual-centered metrics for evaluation, integrating retrieval-based methods to ground LLM responses in external knowledge, and crafting sophisticated prompting techniques to encourage reasoning and verification. This empirical cycle of problem identification and practical solution development was the dominant paradigm.\n\n    However, \"[xu2024n76] Hallucination is Inevitable: An Innate Limitation of Large Language Models (2024)\" marks a pivotal shift. It moves away from purely empirical observation and mitigation to a rigorous, formal, and theoretical proof-based methodology. The paper introduces a \"formal world\" where LLMs are abstracted as total computable functions and ground truth is defined as a computable function. This abstraction allows for the application of advanced concepts from learning theory, specifically Cantor's diagonalization argument, to derive fundamental truths about LLM capabilities. This represents a methodological leap from \"how to fix\" to \"what are the fundamental limits,\" providing a new lens through which to understand LLM behavior.\n\n- *Problem evolution*: The evolution of the problem focus is equally profound. Earlier research primarily aimed to *reduce* the incidence of hallucination, treating it as a solvable engineering challenge. The underlying assumption was that with enough data, better architectures, or more refined training, hallucination could eventually be eliminated. While these efforts yielded valuable practical improvements, they inherently could not answer the fundamental question of whether hallucination could be *completely eliminated*. The impossibility of exhaustively testing all inputs meant that empirical studies, by their nature, could not provide a definitive answer to this ultimate eliminability.\n\n    \"[xu2024n76] Hallucination is Inevitable: An Innate Limitation of Large Language Models (2024)\" directly confronts this unexplored fundamental question. It asks: Is hallucination an inherent, unavoidable limitation of LLMs, or merely a transient problem to be overcome? By providing the first formal definition of hallucination and a theoretical proof of its inevitability, the paper shifts the problem from one of practical reduction to one of fundamental understanding. It re-frames hallucination not as a bug to be fixed, but as an innate characteristic of any computable LLM.\n\n- *Key innovations*: The breakthrough contributions of \"[xu2024n76] Hallucination is Inevitable: An Innate Limitation of Large Language Models (2024)\" lie in its theoretical innovations. Foremost among these is the introduction of a formal definition of hallucination (Definition 4) within a precisely defined \"formal world.\" This formalization allows for discussions independent of specific model architectures or training algorithms. A further innovation is the abstraction of LLMs as total computable functions and the ground truth as a computable function, which provides a robust framework for theoretical analysis.\n\n    The most significant innovation is the application of the diagonalization argument from learning theory to prove the inevitability of hallucination. Specifically, the paper presents Theorem 1, demonstrating that for any computably enumerable set of LLMs, all states will hallucinate on some inputs. Theorem 2 extends this to show hallucination on *infinitely many* inputs. Finally, Theorem 3 generalizes these findings to *any individual computable LLM*. These proofs establish a theoretical upper limit to LLMs' abilities, demonstrating that they cannot learn all computable functions and will thus inevitably generate factually incorrect information if used as general problem solvers. This theoretical insight fundamentally changes the understanding of LLM capabilities and limitations.\n\n3. *Synthesis*\nThis work represents a critical intellectual trajectory from empirically mitigating LLM flaws to theoretically understanding their inherent limitations. \"[xu2024n76] Hallucination is Inevitable: An Innate Limitation of Large Language Models (2024)\" collectively contributes by establishing that hallucination is not merely an engineering challenge but an unavoidable, innate characteristic of all computable LLMs, thereby re-framing future research towards robust detection, mitigation, and responsible deployment rather than complete elimination.",

There have been many works that attempt to reduce the extent of hallucination. These efforts have mostly been empirical so far, which cannot answer the fundamental question whether it can be completely eliminated. In this paper, we formalize the problem and show that it is impossible to eliminate hallucination in LLMs. Specifically, we define a formal world where hallucination is defined as inconsistencies between a computable LLM and a computable ground truth function. By employing results from learning theory, we show that LLMs cannot learn all the computable functions and will therefore inevitably hallucinate if used as general problem solvers. Since the formal world is a part of the real world which is much more complicated, hallucinations are also inevitable for real world LLMs. Furthermore, for real world LLMs constrained by provable time complexity, we describe the hallucination-prone tasks and empirically validate our claims. Finally, using the formal world framework, we discuss the possible mechanisms and efficacies of existing hallucination mitigators as well as the practical implications on the safe deployment of LLMs.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper \\cite{xu2024n76} for a literature review:\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** The paper addresses the fundamental question of whether hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) can be completely eliminated.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** Hallucination, where LLMs generate plausible but factually incorrect or nonsensical information, is a critical challenge impacting the safety and ethics of LLM deployment. Prior research has been largely empirical, focusing on mitigation, but has not provided a formal answer to its ultimate eliminability, which is crucial for understanding the inherent limitations and capabilities of LLMs.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** Previous works have primarily focused on empirically identifying sources of hallucination (e.g., data collection, training, inference issues) and proposing mitigation strategies (e.g., factual-centered metrics, retrieval-based methods, prompting for reasoning/verification).\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:** These empirical studies, while useful, cannot answer the fundamental question of whether hallucination can be *completely eliminated* due to the impossibility of exhaustively testing all inputs. A formal definition and analysis of hallucination were lacking.\n    *   **Positioning:** \\cite{xu2024n76} distinguishes itself by providing the first formal definition of hallucination and a theoretical proof of its inevitability for all computable LLMs. It notes a parallel work by Kalai and Vempala \\cite{kalai2023statistical} which provides a statistical lower bound on hallucination rates for calibrated LLMs, but positions its own results as more general, applicable to all computable LLMs.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper formalizes the problem by defining a \"formal world\" where hallucination is precisely defined as inconsistencies between a computable LLM and a computable ground truth function. It then employs results from learning theory, specifically the diagonalization argument (Cantor's diagonalization), to prove the inevitability of hallucination.\n    *   **Novelty:** The core innovation lies in shifting from empirical observation to a rigorous, formal proof. By abstracting LLMs as total computable functions and defining a ground truth function, the paper provides a theoretical upper limit to LLMs' abilities, demonstrating that they cannot learn all computable functions and will thus inevitably hallucinate if used as general problem solvers. This formalization allows for discussions independent of specific model architectures, training algorithms, or data.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms, Methods, or Techniques:**\n        *   A formal definition of hallucination within a \"formal world\" of computable functions (Definition 4).\n        *   A formal procedure for training and deploying an LLM (Procedure 1) that abstracts away implementation details.\n        *   Proof of inevitability of hallucination for any computably enumerable set of LLMs (Theorem 1), showing that all states of such LLMs will hallucinate on some inputs.\n        *   Proof that hallucination will occur on *infinitely many* inputs for any computably enumerable set of LLMs (Theorem 2).\n        *   Generalization of these proofs to show that hallucination is inevitable for *any individual computable LLM* (Theorem 3), both on some inputs and on infinitely many inputs.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights or Analysis:** The application of the diagonalization argument from learning theory to demonstrate a fundamental, inherent limitation of LLMs, regardless of their training or architecture.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** The abstract and contributions section state that the paper \"show examples of hallucination-prone problems and validate the claims by empirical study.\" However, the provided text content *ends* before detailing these specific experiments, performance metrics, or comparison results. The paper mentions it will describe \"hallucination-prone tasks\" and empirically validate claims for real-world LLMs constrained by provable time complexity.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:**\n        *   The primary proof is conducted in a \"formal world\" where LLMs are considered total computable functions and ground truth is a computable function. While argued to apply to the more complex real world, this abstraction is a simplification.\n        *   The definition of hallucination relies on a unique \"correct output\" for any input string, and in some theoretical discussions, assumes an unbounded time limit for LLM computation.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The findings apply to all computable LLMs, including those constrained by polynomial time complexity, which encompasses all currently proposed real-world LLMs.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** This paper fundamentally shifts the understanding of LLM hallucination from a solvable engineering problem to an inherent, inevitable limitation. It provides a theoretical foundation for why complete elimination of hallucination is impossible.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:**\n        *   Informs realistic expectations for LLM capabilities and guides research away from the pursuit of \"hallucination-free\" LLMs towards more effective mitigation, detection, and robust deployment strategies.\n        *   Highlights the need for LLMs to be used as specialized tools rather than general problem solvers without external verification.\n        *   Provides a framework for discussing the mechanisms and efficacies of existing and future hallucination mitigators within a formal context.",

My analysis needs to focus on this paper's contributions, the problems it addresses, and the innovations it introduces, framed as an \"evolution\" from prior approaches that it references.\n\n**Chronological Analysis (for a single paper, this means analyzing its position relative to the state-of-the-art it critiques):**\n\n*   **Methodological/Conceptual Shifts:**\n    *   The primary shift introduced by \"[yao20229uz] ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models (2022)\" is the move from *isolated* reasoning (e.g., Chain-of-Thought, CoT) or *isolated* acting to a *synergistic, interleaved* generation of both \"thoughts\" and \"actions.\" This is a fundamental conceptual shift in how LLMs are prompted to interact with environments and perform complex tasks.\n    *   It introduces an \"augmented action space\" that explicitly includes language for reasoning, allowing the LLM to self-regulate its cognitive process.\n\n*   **Problems Addressed:**\n    *   **Hallucination and Error Propagation in Reasoning-only (CoT):** CoT relies solely on internal representations, making it ungrounded, prone to generating incorrect facts (hallucination), and unable to update its knowledge or react to external feedback. ReAct addresses this by grounding reasoning in external observations.\n    *   **Lack of Abstract Reasoning in Acting-only Approaches:** Previous action-only methods lacked the ability for LLMs to perform high-level abstract reasoning, maintain a working memory, or handle exceptions, leading to less robust decision-making. ReAct integrates reasoning to guide actions.\n    *   **Limited Human-like Intelligence:** The challenge of emulating human-like intelligence, which seamlessly combines inner verbal reasoning with task-oriented actions for self-regulation and robust decision-making, is a core motivation addressed by ReAct.\n\n*   **Innovations/Capabilities Introduced:**\n    *   **ReAct Paradigm:** A novel prompt-based paradigm that enables LLMs to generate verbal reasoning traces (\"thoughts\") and task-specific actions in an *interleaved manner*.\n    *   **Dynamic Synergy:** This interleaved generation allows for \"reason to act\" (creating/adjusting plans) and \"act to reason\" (incorporating external information to update reasoning).\n    *   **Augmented Action Space:** The agent's action space is expanded to include language (`L`) for thoughts, which do not affect the external environment but compose useful information.\n    *   **Few-shot Prompting:** Demonstrates strong generalization and performance in few-shot settings across diverse benchmarks, often outperforming methods trained with much more data.\n    *   **Enhanced Interpretability and Controllability:** The explicit reasoning traces provide a human-aligned, interpretable, and diagnosable decision-making process, allowing inspection of reasoning and factual correctness.\n    *   **Improved Robustness and Grounding:** By interacting with external environments (e.g., Wikipedia API), ReAct directly combats hallucination and error propagation by grounding LLM reasoning in real-world observations.\n\n*   **Temporal Gaps/External Influences:**\n    *   The paper was published in 2022, a period characterized by the rapid emergence and increasing capabilities of very large language models (like PaLM-540B, which ReAct uses).\n    *   It directly builds upon and critiques the limitations of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which had gained significant attention shortly before its publication. The recognition of CoT's power but also its inherent ungroundedness provided the impetus for ReAct.\n    *   The availability of powerful, pre-trained LLMs capable of few-shot learning was a crucial enabler for ReAct's prompt-based approach.\n\nThis detailed breakdown will form the basis for the narrative and synthesis sections.",

        "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across tasks in language understanding and interactive decision making, their abilities for reasoning (e.g. chain-of-thought prompting) and acting (e.g. action plan generation) have primarily been studied as separate topics. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy between the two: reasoning traces help the model induce, track, and update action plans as well as handle exceptions, while actions allow it to interface with external sources, such as knowledge bases or environments, to gather additional information. We apply our approach, named ReAct, to a diverse set of language and decision making tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines, as well as improved human interpretability and trustworthiness over methods without reasoning or acting components. Concretely, on question answering (HotpotQA) and fact verification (Fever), ReAct overcomes issues of hallucination and error propagation prevalent in chain-of-thought reasoning by interacting with a simple Wikipedia API, and generates human-like task-solving trajectories that are more interpretable than baselines without reasoning traces. On two interactive decision making benchmarks (ALFWorld and WebShop), ReAct outperforms imitation and reinforcement learning methods by an absolute success rate of 34% and 10% respectively, while being prompted with only one or two in-context examples.

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \"ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models\" by `\\cite{yao20229uz}` for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in both reasoning (e.g., chain-of-thought prompting) and acting (e.g., action plan generation), but these abilities have primarily been studied and applied in isolation. This separation limits their effectiveness in complex tasks requiring both.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**:\n        *   **Reasoning-only (CoT)**: Suffers from issues like fact hallucination and error propagation because it relies solely on internal representations and is not grounded in the external world, preventing reactive reasoning or knowledge updates `\\cite{yao20229uz}`.\n        *   **Acting-only**: Lacks the ability for LLMs to reason abstractly about high-level goals, maintain a working memory, or handle exceptions, leading to less robust decision-making in interactive environments `\\cite{yao20229uz}`.\n        *   **Human-like Intelligence**: Humans seamlessly combine verbal reasoning (inner speech) with task-oriented actions for self-regulation, strategization, and robust decision-making, even under uncertainty. Emulating this synergy in LLMs is a key challenge for general task solving `\\cite{yao20229uz}`.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: `\\cite{yao20229uz}` positions ReAct as a paradigm that bridges the gap between Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and action generation in LLMs.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**: While effective for multi-step reasoning, CoT is a \"static black box\" that uses internal representations, making it ungrounded, prone to hallucination, and unable to update its knowledge based on external feedback `\\cite{yao20229uz}`.\n        *   **Action-only approaches**: These focus on predicting domain-specific actions from textual observations but typically do not employ LLMs for abstract high-level reasoning or maintaining a working memory to support acting `\\cite{yao20229uz}`. Some limited forms of verbal reasoning exist but are not synergistic.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: `\\cite{yao20229uz}` introduces ReAct, a general paradigm that prompts LLMs to generate both verbal reasoning traces (\"thoughts\") and task-specific actions in an *interleaved manner*.\n    *   **Novelty**:\n        *   **Augmented Action Space**: ReAct augments the agent's action space to include language (`^A = A \\cup L`), where `L` is the space of language for \"thoughts.\" Thoughts do not affect the external environment but compose useful information by reasoning over the current context and updating it to support future reasoning or acting `\\cite{yao20229uz}`.\n        *   **Dynamic Synergy**: This interleaved generation allows for dynamic reasoning to create, maintain, and adjust high-level plans for acting (\"reason to act\"), while simultaneously interacting with external environments (e.g., Wikipedia API) to incorporate additional information into reasoning (\"act to reason\") `\\cite{yao20229uz}`.\n        *   **Few-shot Prompting**: ReAct primarily operates by prompting a frozen LLM (PaLM-540B) with few-shot in-context examples, demonstrating strong generalization without extensive training `\\cite{yao20229uz}`.\n        *   **Flexible Thought Occurrence**: For reasoning-intensive tasks, thoughts and actions alternate densely. For decision-making tasks with many actions, thoughts can appear sparsely and asynchronously, allowing the model to decide when reasoning is needed `\\cite{yao20229uz}`.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Paradigm**: Introduction of ReAct, a prompt-based paradigm to synergize reasoning and acting in language models for general task solving `\\cite{yao20229uz}`.\n    *   **Extensive Empirical Validation**: Demonstrates the advantage of ReAct in a few-shot learning setup across diverse benchmarks over prior approaches that perform either reasoning or action generation in isolation `\\cite{yao20229uz}`.\n    *   **Systematic Ablations and Analysis**: Provides insights into the importance of acting in reasoning tasks and reasoning in interactive tasks `\\cite{yao20229uz}`.\n    *   **Combined Internal and External Knowledge**: Proposes and evaluates methods (e.g., `CoT-SC!ReAct`, `ReAct!CoT-SC`) to combine ReAct's external grounding with CoT-SC's internal reasoning for enhanced performance `\\cite{yao20229uz}`.\n    *   **Interpretability and Controllability**: The interleaved thoughts provide an interpretable, human-aligned, and diagnosable decision-making process, allowing humans to inspect reasoning and factual correctness `\\cite{yao20229uz}`.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Tasks**: Evaluated on four diverse benchmarks:\n        *   **Knowledge-intensive Reasoning**: HotpotQA (multi-hop QA) and FEVER (fact verification), using a simple Wikipedia API for external interaction `\\cite{yao20229uz}`.\n        *   **Interactive Decision Making**: ALFWorld (text-based games) and WebShop (webpage navigation) `\\cite{yao20229uz}`.\n    *   **Baselines**: Compared against Standard prompting, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), CoT with Self-Consistency (CoT-SC), and Act-only prompting `\\cite{yao20229uz}`. For interactive tasks, also compared against imitation and reinforcement learning methods.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Results**:\n        *   **HotpotQA & FEVER**: ReAct, with access to a Wikipedia API, outperforms vanilla action generation models and is competitive with CoT. The best approach is a combination of ReAct and CoT-SC (`CoT-SC!ReAct` or `ReAct!CoT-SC`), achieving 35.1 EM on HotpotQA and 64.6 Acc on FEVER, demonstrating the synergy of internal and external knowledge `\\cite{yao20229uz}`.\n        *   **ALFWorld & WebShop**: Few-shot (one or two examples) ReAct prompting significantly outperforms imitation and reinforcement learning methods trained with 10^3-10^5 task instances, with absolute success rate improvements of 34% and 10% respectively `\\cite{yao20229uz}`.\n        *   **Interpretability**: ReAct generates human-like task-solving trajectories that are more interpretable and trustworthy than baselines without reasoning traces `\\cite{yao20229uz}`.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Prompting Setup Limitations**: The current prompting setup has limited support for complex reasoning and acting behaviors `\\cite{yao20229uz}`.\n    *   **Data Scarcity**: Manual annotation of reasoning traces and actions at scale is challenging, suggesting a need for bootstrapping or other data generation methods `\\cite{yao20229uz}`.\n    *   **Future Scaling**: The paper notes that scaling up ReAct with additional training data (e.g., through finetuning) and combining it with complementary paradigms like reinforcement learning could further unlock its potential `\\cite{yao20229uz}`.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art**: `\\cite{yao20229uz}` significantly advances the state-of-the-art in LLM capabilities by demonstrating that synergizing reasoning and acting leads to more robust, grounded, and performant agents for diverse tasks, especially in few-shot settings.\n    *   **Improved Robustness and Grounding**: ReAct overcomes prevalent issues of hallucination and error propagation in CoT by grounding reasoning in external information obtained through actions `\\cite{yao20229uz}`.\n    *   **Enhanced Interpretability**: The explicit reasoning traces make LLM decision-making processes more transparent, interpretable, and diagnosable for humans `\\cite{yao20229uz}`.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: ReAct opens new avenues for research into more general, human-aligned, and controllable AI agents, suggesting that combining LLMs with interactive environments and explicit reasoning is a powerful direction for developing more capable autonomous systems `\\cite{yao20229uz}`.",

    "seed_title": "Mitigating Hallucination in Large Multi-Modal Models via Robust Instruction Tuning",
    "summary": "**Integration Analysis:**\n\nThe integration of these eighteen new papers significantly enriches and refines the previously synthesized understanding of \"Hallucination in Large Language Models.\" They demonstrate a rapid acceleration and diversification of research in this domain, particularly in 2024 and 2025.\n\n1.  **Relationship to Previous Trends:**\n    *   **Trend 1 (Methodological Shift Towards Efficient, Post-Generative Interventions):** This trend is not only extended but also deeply diversified. The initial progression from training-based prevention `[liu2023882]` to post-hoc correction `[yin2023hx3]` and decoding-time mitigation `[leng2023ohr]` is now a multi-faceted landscape. New papers introduce more sophisticated decoding strategies, novel forward-pass interventions, advanced training-based methods with automated data generation, and entirely new paradigms like retrieval augmentation and self-correction.\n    *   **Trend 2 (Deepening Conceptual Understanding and Formalization of Hallucination):** This trend is dramatically expanded in scope and granularity. The initial conceptualization of hallucination `[liu2023882]` and its causes `[leng2023ohr]`, formalized by `[huang2023akj]`, is now broken down into a multitude of specific types (temporal, relation, long-context, multilingual, snowballing) and underlying mechanisms (visual encoding distortion, semantic shift bias, attention sinks, modality priors). Evaluation benchmarks have evolved to match this granularity, moving beyond simple object detection to complex, multi-modal, and adversarial assessments.\n\n2.  **New Methodological or Conceptual Shifts:**\n    *   **Shift to Fine-Grained, Internal Interventions:** Many new mitigation methods (`[zou2024dp7] MemVR`, `[wang2024vym] VaLiD`, `[chen2024j0g] ICT`, `[yin2025s2b] ClearSight (VAF)`, `[zhou2024lvp] CAUSAL MM`) focus on manipulating internal model states (attention, hidden layers, logit space) during the forward pass or decoding, rather than just external post-processing or full retraining. This reflects a deeper understanding of MLLM/LVLM internal workings.\n    *   **Automated and Targeted Data Generation for Training:** Papers like `[chen20247jb] HIO`, `[zhou2024wbi] POVID`, `[qu20240f7] MHR`, `[fu2024yqj] HDPO`, and `[xing2024itg] EFUF` show a clear shift towards automatically generating high-quality, hallucination-aware preference data or unlearning samples, making training-based methods more scalable and less reliant on costly human annotation.\n    *   **Emergence of Adversarial Attacks:** `[wang2025jen] Mirage in the Eyes` introduces a significant conceptual shift by focusing on *inducing* hallucinations through adversarial attacks. This marks a move from purely defensive mitigation to proactive robustness testing and vulnerability analysis.\n    *   **Emphasis on Self-Correction and Intrinsic Capabilities:** `[wu2024h81] LogicCheckGPT` and `[qu2024pqc] MVP` highlight leveraging the LVLM's own reasoning and generative capabilities for self-correction and richer understanding, reducing reliance on external expert models.\n    *   **Causal Understanding:** `[zhou2024lvp] CAUSAL MM` introduces causal inference to understand the *causal* impact of modality priors on attention and output, moving beyond correlational analysis.\n\n3.  **Gaps Filled and New Directions Opened:**\n    *   **Gaps Filled:** The new papers fill critical gaps in evaluating and mitigating hallucinations beyond simple object presence, addressing long-context, temporal, relational, and multilingual aspects. The surveys (`[lan20240yz] Survey`, `[liu2024sn3] Survey`, `[bai2024tkm] Survey`) provide much-needed comprehensive taxonomies and structured overviews.\n    *   **New Directions Opened:** Adversarial attacks (`[wang2025jen] Mirage in the Eyes`), the study of \"hallucination snowballing\" in conversations (`[zhong2024mfi] MMHalSnowball`), and the exploration of subtle biases like \"semantic shift bias\" from paragraph breaks (`[han202439z] Skip \\n`) open entirely new avenues for research into MLLM vulnerabilities and robustness. The use of T2I models for contrastive decoding (`[park20247cm] ConVis`) is also a novel direction.\n\n4.  **Connections Between New and Earlier Works:**\n    *   Many new papers directly build upon or contrast with the foundational decoding-time methods like VCD `[leng2023ohr]`, aiming to improve its efficiency or address its limitations (e.g., `[zou2024dp7] MemVR`, `[wang2024vym] VaLiD`, `[chen20247jb] HIO`, `[yin2025s2b] ClearSight (VAF)`, `[zhou2024lvp] CAUSAL MM`, `[park20247cm] ConVis`).\n    *   Post-hoc correction frameworks like Woodpecker `[yin2023hx3]` are extended by more sophisticated, iterative approaches like `[chang2024u3t] Dentist` and `[wu2024h81] LogicCheckGPT`.\n    *   The general understanding of hallucination causes from `[leng2023ohr]` and `[huang2023akj]` is now deeply specialized by papers identifying specific causes like \"Visual Encoding Distortion\" `[wang2024vym]`, \"semantic shift bias\" `[han202439z]`, and \"attention sinks\" `[wang2025jen]`.\n\n5.  **Changes to Overall Narrative:** The overall narrative shifts from a nascent field grappling with a broad problem to a mature, highly specialized domain. The focus has moved from general mitigation to understanding the *specific types, causes, and mechanisms* of hallucination, leading to highly targeted and efficient solutions. The field is no longer just reactive but is also proactively probing vulnerabilities and building robust evaluation frameworks. The sheer volume and diversity of 2024/2025 papers indicate an explosion of research activity and a critical area for MLLM/LVLM development.\n\n---\n\n**Updated Evolution Analysis:**\n\nThe research trajectory into \"Hallucination in Large Language Models,\" particularly in their multimodal (MLLM) and vision-language (LVLM) instantiations, has undergone a profound evolution. Building upon initial foundational work, the field has rapidly expanded across three interconnected trends: a **diversification and refinement of mitigation strategies towards efficiency, granularity, and self-correction**, a **deepening and broadening of conceptual understanding coupled with advanced evaluation methodologies**, and the emergence of a new focus on **proactive robustness through adversarial attacks and vulnerability probing**.\n\n### Trend 1: Diversification and Refinement of Mitigation Strategies Towards Efficiency, Granularity, and Self-Correction\n\nInitially, mitigation efforts were characterized by a methodological shift from costly, training-based prevention to more efficient, post-hoc, and decoding-time interventions. `[liu2023882] Mitigating Hallucination in Large Multi-Modal Models via Robust Instruction Tuning (2023)` exemplified the preventative, training-intensive approach. This was swiftly followed by `[yin2023hx3] Woodpecker: Hallucination Correction for Multimodal Large Language Models (2023)`, introducing a post-remedy, training-free correction framework leveraging external expert models. `[leng2023ohr] Mitigating Object Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models through Visual Contrastive Decoding (2023)` further refined this by proposing a decoding-time, training-free strategy (VCD) that penalizes tokens based on subtly distorted visual inputs.\n\nThe latest research significantly expands these categories and introduces new paradigms:\n\n*   **Advanced Decoding-Time and Forward-Pass Interventions:** Building on VCD, new methods offer more nuanced control. `[zou2024dp7] MemVR: Memory-Space Visual Retracing (2024)` re-injects visual tokens into middle layers when uncertainty is high, addressing visual \"amnesia.\" `[wang2024vym] VaLiD: Visual Layer Fusion Contrastive Decoding (2024)` tackles \"Visual Encoding Distortion\" by fusing features from early visual layers based on uncertainty. `[chen2024j0g] ICT: Image-Object Cross-Level Trusted Intervention (2024)` introduces a training-free forward-pass intervention, shifting attention in specific heads to enhance visual focus without latency. `[yin2025s2b] ClearSight: Visual Signal Enhancement (2025)` (VAF) similarly enhances visual signals in middle layers, avoiding VCD's drawbacks. `[zhou2024lvp] CAUSAL MM (2024)` applies causal inference to attention mechanisms to balance modality priors, offering a principled approach. `[park20247cm] ConVis: Contrastive Decoding with Hallucination Visualization (2024)` innovatively uses a Text-to-Image model to visualize potential hallucinations for contrastive signals. `[zhao2024ge8] MARINE: Image-Grounded Guidance (2024)` leverages external vision models to create textual guidance prompts for logit-space control. `[zhong2024mfi] Residual Visual Decoding (RVD) (2024)` is a decoding method to mitigate \"hallucination snowballing\" by emphasizing direct visual evidence. `[han202439z] Skip \\n (2024)` identifies a \"semantic shift bias\" from paragraph breaks and offers simple prompt/logit-based interventions (MiHI/MiHO). `[zheng20246fk] Detect-then-Calibrate (2024)` uses token-level confidence and entropy for decoding-time mitigation of relation hallucinations.\n\n*   **Sophisticated Post-Hoc Correction Frameworks:** Beyond Woodpecker `[yin2023hx3]`, frameworks like `[chang2024u3t] Dentist (2024)` classify query types (perception/reasoning) and apply tailored, iterative correction loops using external LLMs. `[wu2024h81] LogicCheckGPT (2024)` introduces a \"Logical Closed Loop\" for self-correction, leveraging the LVLM's own logical consistency across related questions to detect and rectify object hallucinations. `[wang2024rta] Self-PEP (2024)` is another post-hoc framework for improving hallucination resistance.\n\n*   **Targeted and Automated Training-Based Methods:** While `[liu2023882]` used extensive instruction tuning, newer approaches focus on more efficient data generation. `[chen20247jb] HIO: Hallucination-Induced Optimization (2024)` trains an \"Evil LVLM\" to *prioritize* hallucinations for stronger contrastive decoding. `[zhou2024wbi] POVID: Preference Optimization (2024)` automates the generation of *dispreferred* responses using AI (GPT-4V and diffusion noise) for DPO. `[qu20240f7] MHR: Multilingual Hallucination Removal (2024)` uses multilingual SFT and DPO with *automatically generated* cross-lingual hallucination data. `[fu2024yqj] HDPO: Hallucination-targeted Direct Preference Optimization (2024)` designs preference data for specific hallucination causes (visual distracted, long context, multimodal conflict). `[xing2024itg] EFUF: Efficient Fine-Grained Unlearning Framework (2024)` employs unlearning with CLIP-auto-curated data for efficient, fine-grained hallucination mitigation.\n\n*   **Emergence of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** `[qu20246yn] ARA: Active Retrieval Augmentation (2024)` introduces RAG as a distinct mitigation strategy for LVLMs, using active triggering, coarse-to-fine hierarchical retrieval, and reranking to integrate external knowledge.\n\n*   **Leveraging Inherent Model Capabilities:** `[qu2024pqc] MVP: Multi-View Multi-Path Reasoning (2024)` is a training-free, tool-free method that maximizes LVLM's innate capabilities by generating multi-view captions and using certainty-driven decoding.\n\n### Trend 2: Deepening Conceptual Understanding and Granular Evaluation of Hallucination\n\nThe initial conceptual understanding of hallucination `[liu2023882]` and its causes `[leng2023ohr]` was formalized by `[huang2023akj] A Survey on Hallucination in Large Language Models (2023)`. This trend has exploded with new papers introducing a much richer taxonomy of hallucination types and sophisticated evaluation benchmarks.\n\n*   **Expanding Hallucination Taxonomy:** Beyond object and attribute hallucinations, the field now recognizes:\n    *   *Long-context hallucinations*: `[qiu2024zyc] LongHalQA (2024)` introduces a benchmark for this.\n    *   *Temporal hallucinations*: `[li2024wyb] VidHalluc (2024)` and `[wang2024rta] VideoHallucer (2024)` focus on video understanding, categorizing action, temporal sequence, and scene transition hallucinations, as well as intrinsic/extrinsic types.\n    *   *Relation hallucinations*: `[wu20241us] Tri-HE (2024)` and `[zheng20246fk] Reefknot (2024)` highlight the severity of misinterpreting relationships between objects, distinguishing perceptive and cognitive types.\n    *   *Multilingual hallucinations*: `[qu20240f7] MHR (2024)` addresses the increased severity of hallucinations in non-English languages.\n    *   *Hallucination snowballing*: `[zhong2024mfi] MMHalSnowball (2024)` identifies how prior hallucinations can mislead subsequent generations in conversational contexts.\n    *   New modes like *shape* and *size* are introduced by `[huang20247wn] VHTest (2024)`.\n\n*   **Advanced Evaluation Benchmarks:** Evaluation has moved beyond simple discriminative tasks:\n    *   `[qiu2024zyc] LongHalQA (2024)` offers an LLM-free, unified MCQ format for long contexts.\n    *   `[li2024wyb] VidHalluc (2024)` provides diverse question formats for temporal hallucinations.\n    *   `[huang20247wn] VHTest (2024)` introduces an adversarial generation paradigm for diverse visual hallucination instances.\n    *   `[wang2024rta] VideoHallucer (2024)` uses adversarial paired questions for intrinsic/extrinsic video hallucinations.\n    *   `[li2024osp] Drowzee (2024)` employs logic-programming-aided metamorphic testing for fact-conflicting hallucinations in LLMs (relevant for LVLM backbones).\n    *   `[yebin2024txh] BEAF: Observing BEfore-AFter Changes (2024)` innovatively manipulates visual scenes (object removal) and introduces change-aware metrics to assess true understanding.\n    *   `[wu20241us] Tri-HE (2024)` provides a unified triplet-level evaluation for object and relation hallucinations.\n    *   `[zheng20246fk] Reefknot (2024)` offers a comprehensive benchmark for relation hallucinations with real-world data and multi-faceted tasks.\n\n*   **Causal Understanding and Root Causes:** The field is increasingly probing the underlying mechanisms:\n    *   `[wang2024vym] VaLiD (2024)` identifies \"Visual Encoding Distortion.\"\n    *   `[han202439z] Skip \\n (2024)` uncovers a \"semantic shift bias\" linked to paragraph breaks.\n    *   `[zhou2024lvp] CAUSAL MM (2024)` uses causal inference to understand how modality priors *causally* influence outputs via attention.\n    *   `[wang2025jen] Mirage in the Eyes (2025)` links hallucinations to the \"attention sink\" phenomenon.\n\n*   **Comprehensive Surveys:** The initial survey `[huang2023akj]` is now complemented by more specialized and updated overviews: `[lan20240yz] A Survey of Hallucination in Large Visual Language Models (2024)`, `[liu2024sn3] A Survey on Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (2024)`, and `[bai2024tkm] Hallucination of Multimodal Large Language Models: A Survey (2024)` provide detailed taxonomies, causes, and mitigation strategies specifically for LVLMs/MLLMs.\n\n### Trend 3: Proactive Robustness: Adversarial Attacks and Vulnerability Probing\n\nA significant new direction is the proactive exploration of MLLM vulnerabilities. `[wang2025jen] Mirage in the Eyes: Hallucination Attack on Multi-modal Large Language Models with Only Attention Sink (2025)` introduces a novel adversarial attack that exploits the \"attention sink\" phenomenon to induce hallucinations. This moves beyond merely mitigating observed hallucinations to actively probing and understanding *how* models can be made to hallucinate, which is crucial for building truly robust and trustworthy systems. `[huang20247wn] VHTest (2024)` also incorporates adversarial generation of hallucination instances, and `[han202439z] Skip \\n (2024)` demonstrates how to induce hallucinations by inserting paragraph breaks. This trend signifies a maturation of the field, recognizing that understanding failure modes is as important as fixing them.\n\n---\n\n**Refined Synthesis:**\n\nThe collective body of work reveals a dynamic intellectual trajectory in addressing hallucination, evolving from initial broad observations and costly preventative measures to a highly granular, efficient, and multi-faceted approach. The field has deepened its understanding of hallucination from empirical observation to a formalized taxonomy encompassing diverse types and underlying causal mechanisms, enabling the development of sophisticated, often training-free, and self-correcting mitigation strategies. This expanded view highlights a critical shift towards not only reactive mitigation but also proactive robustness engineering through advanced evaluation and adversarial vulnerability probing, collectively advancing the reliability and trustworthiness of large multimodal AI systems.",

        "title": "Mitigating Hallucination in Large Multi-Modal Models via Robust Instruction Tuning",
        "abstract": "Despite the promising progress in multi-modal tasks, current large multi-modal models (LMMs) are prone to hallucinating inconsistent descriptions with respect to the associated image and human instructions. This paper addresses this issue by introducing the first large and diverse visual instruction tuning dataset, named Large-scale Robust Visual (LRV)-Instruction. Our dataset comprises 400k visual instructions generated by GPT4, covering 16 vision-and-language tasks with open-ended instructions and answers. Unlike existing studies that primarily focus on positive instruction samples, we design LRV-Instruction to include both positive and negative instructions for more robust visual instruction tuning. Our negative instructions are designed at three semantic levels: (i) Nonexistent Object Manipulation, (ii) Existent Object Manipulation and (iii) Knowledge Manipulation. To efficiently measure the hallucination generated by LMMs, we propose GPT4-Assisted Visual Instruction Evaluation (GAVIE), a stable approach to evaluate visual instruction tuning like human experts. GAVIE does not require human-annotated groundtruth answers and can adapt to diverse instruction formats. We conduct comprehensive experiments to investigate the hallucination of LMMs. Our results demonstrate existing LMMs exhibit significant hallucinations when presented with our negative instructions, particularly Existent Object and Knowledge Manipulation instructions. Moreover, we successfully mitigate hallucination by finetuning MiniGPT4 and mPLUG-Owl on LRV-Instruction while improving performance on several public datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we observed that a balanced ratio of positive and negative instances in the training data leads to a more robust model. Code and data are available at https://github.com/FuxiaoLiu/LRV-Instruction.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review:\n\n### Analyzing \"MITIGATING HALLUCINATION IN LARGE MULTI-MODAL MODELS VIA ROBUST INSTRUCTION TUNING\" \\cite{liu2023882}\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Large Multi-Modal Models (LMMs) frequently \"hallucinate,\" generating descriptions that are inconsistent with the associated image content and human instructions. This includes describing nonexistent objects or activities, or providing lengthy, irrelevant responses.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge**: Hallucination is a major ethical concern, inherited from Large Language Models (LLMs), and can lead to harmful consequences if users over-rely on convincing but inaccurate LMM outputs. Existing LMMs often over-rely on language priors and are trained on synthetic data that may contain inconsistencies or lack diversity, leading to this problem. Current evaluation methods for hallucination are often unstable, require specific templates, or don't adequately penalize inconsistencies.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Previous LMMs like LLaVA, MiniGPT4, InstructBLIP, MMGPT, and mPLUG-Owl have shown progress in multi-modal tasks but are primarily instruction-tuned on datasets with limited task diversity, predefined templates, or only positive instruction samples.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   Existing LMMs often use synthetic instruction data that can be long and involve nonexistent elements, contributing to hallucination.\n        *   Training datasets are typically unbalanced, containing only \"positive\" instructions, leading LMMs to default to \"Yes\" or affirmative answers even when incorrect.\n        *   Current hallucination evaluation metrics (e.g., CIDEr, SPICE) do not penalize hallucination effectively. Others like CHAIR are unstable, and some (e.g., \\cite{li2023c}) require specific, restrictive instruction templates.\n    *   **Positioning of this Work**: \\cite{liu2023882} addresses these limitations by introducing a large, diverse dataset with *negative instructions* at various semantic levels and a novel, flexible evaluation method, aiming to improve LMM robustness against hallucination.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**:\n        *   **LRV-Instruction Dataset**: A large-scale (400k instances) and diverse visual instruction tuning dataset covering 16 vision-and-language tasks with open-ended instructions and answers. It uniquely includes both positive and *negative* instruction samples.\n        *   **Negative Instruction Design**: Negative instructions are designed at three semantic levels to challenge LMMs:\n            1.  **Nonexistent Object Manipulation**: Introducing objects, activities, attributes, or interactions not present in the image.\n            2.  **Existent Object Manipulation**: Manipulating existent objects with inconsistent attributes.\n            3.  **Knowledge Manipulation**: Manipulating external knowledge (e.g., named entities, events) related to the image.\n        *   **GPT4-Assisted Visual Instruction Evaluation (GAVIE)**: A novel, stable evaluation approach that leverages GPT4 to assess LMM outputs. It measures two aspects: \"Relevancy\" (instruction-following) and \"Accuracy\" (visual hallucination).\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   First dataset to systematically incorporate diverse *negative instructions* across multiple semantic levels to explicitly train LMMs to identify and avoid hallucination.\n        *   Utilizes GPT4 for large-scale, open-ended instruction generation, moving beyond human-crafted templates and limited task types.\n        *   GAVIE offers a flexible, groundtruth-free, and human-aligned evaluation method for hallucination, overcoming limitations of prior metrics.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Dataset**: Introduction of **LRV-Instruction** \\cite{liu2023882}, a 400k-instance dataset with 16 vision-language tasks, featuring open-ended positive and, crucially, three types of semantically-rich negative instructions (Nonexistent Object, Existent Object, Knowledge Manipulation) in declarative and interrogative formats.\n    *   **Novel Evaluation Method**: Proposal of **GAVIE** \\cite{liu2023882}, a GPT4-assisted evaluation framework that assesses LMM outputs for both instruction-following relevancy and visual hallucination accuracy, without requiring human-annotated groundtruth answers or specific instruction formats.\n    *   **Empirical Insights**: Comprehensive experiments demonstrating the significant hallucination tendencies of existing LMMs, particularly with Existent Object and Knowledge Manipulation instructions, and validating the effectiveness of LRV-Instruction for robust instruction tuning.\n    *   **Architectural/Training Insight**: Discovery that a balanced ratio of positive and negative instances in the training data is critical for achieving a more robust LMM.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**:\n        *   Evaluation of five publicly available LMMs (MiniGPT4, LLaVA, InstructBLIP, MMGPT, mPLUG-Owl) on the LRV-Instruction benchmark, specifically with negative instructions.\n        *   Finetuning of MiniGPT4 and mPLUG-Owl on the LRV-Instruction dataset.\n        *   Comparison of finetuned models against original LMMs and state-of-the-art methods on both the proposed evaluation set and public benchmarks (e.g., MME, POPE, GQA).\n        *   Analysis of the impact of positive/negative instance ratios on model robustness.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results**:\n        *   Existing LMMs exhibited *significant hallucinations* when presented with negative instructions, especially Existent Object and Knowledge Manipulation types.\n        *   Finetuning MiniGPT4 and mPLUG-Owl on LRV-Instruction successfully *mitigated hallucination* and *improved performance* on several public datasets, outperforming original models and other SOTA methods.\n        *   GAVIE was shown to be stable and align well with human evaluation.\n        *   A balanced ratio of positive and negative instances in training data was empirically shown to lead to a more robust model.\n        *   Existent Object Manipulation and Knowledge Manipulation instructions were found to be more challenging for LMMs than Nonexistent Object Manipulation.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The dataset generation relies on GPT4's capabilities, and while quality control is applied, potential biases or errors from the generative model could exist. The evaluation method (GAVIE) also relies on GPT4's judgment, assuming its alignment with human experts.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The work focuses on mitigating hallucination in LMMs through instruction tuning. While effective for the tested models and tasks, its direct applicability to all LMM architectures or all possible hallucination types might vary. The dataset covers 16 vision-language tasks, which is diverse but not exhaustive.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: \\cite{liu2023882} significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing the first large-scale, diverse visual instruction tuning dataset that explicitly incorporates negative instructions, directly targeting the hallucination problem in LMMs. It also introduces a robust, flexible, and groundtruth-free evaluation method (GAVIE) for hallucination.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: This work provides a crucial benchmark and training methodology for developing more robust and trustworthy LMMs. It highlights the importance of balanced training data with negative examples and offers a new paradigm for evaluating LMMs beyond traditional metrics. Future research can build upon LRV-Instruction to explore more sophisticated hallucination mitigation techniques, investigate the impact of different negative instruction types, and further refine GPT4-assisted evaluation methods.",

        "title": "Woodpecker: Hallucination Correction for Multimodal Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "Hallucination is a big shadow hanging over the rapidly evolving Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), referring to the phenomenon that the generated text is inconsistent with the image content. In order to mitigate hallucinations, existing studies mainly resort to an instruction-tuning manner that requires retraining the models with specific data. In this paper, we pave a different way, introducing a training-free method named Woodpecker. Like a woodpecker heals trees, it picks out and corrects hallucinations from the generated text. Concretely, Woodpecker consists of five stages: key concept extraction, question formulation, visual knowledge validation, visual claim generation, and hallucination correction. Implemented in a post-remedy manner, Woodpecker can easily serve different MLLMs, while being interpretable by accessing intermediate outputs of the five stages. We evaluate Woodpecker both quantitatively and qualitatively and show the huge potential of this new paradigm. On the POPE benchmark, our method obtains a 30.66%/24.33% improvement in accuracy over the baseline MiniGPT-4/mPLUG-Owl. The source code is released at https://github.com/BradyFU/Woodpecker.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Problem**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently suffer from \"hallucinations,\" where generated text descriptions are inconsistent with the image content. These hallucinations can be object-level (claiming non-existent objects) or attribute-level (incorrectly describing object attributes).\n    *   **Importance & Challenge**: Hallucinations are significant obstacles to the practical application and reliability of MLLMs. Existing mitigation strategies primarily rely on instruction-tuning, which is data-intensive, computationally expensive, and can sometimes sacrifice detail or generative efficiency \\cite{yin2023hx3}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Previous work on hallucination mitigation (e.g., LRV-Instruction, VIGC) focuses on *preventing* hallucinations during the MLLM's generation process, typically through instruction-tuning and data optimization. `\\cite{yin2023hx3}` takes a different, *corrective* approach, refining MLLM responses *after* generation.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Instruction-tuning methods are data- and computation-intensive, making them less flexible and harder to adapt to various MLLMs. They also often involve compromises, such as limiting text length (sacrificing detail) or using multi-step generation (sacrificing efficiency) \\cite{yin2023hx3}.\n    *   **Positioning**: `\\cite{yin2023hx3}` is positioned as a training-free, post-remedy framework that can be easily integrated as a plug-and-play module with different MLLMs. It extends the idea of knowledge-augmented LLMs to the vision-language domain by constructing a structured visual knowledge base and leverages LLM-aided visual reasoning for various subtasks \\cite{yin2023hx3}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: `\\cite{yin2023hx3}` introduces Woodpecker, a training-free, five-stage pipeline for hallucination correction:\n        1.  **Key Concept Extraction**: An LLM (GPT-3.5-turbo) identifies main objects from the MLLM's initial response.\n        2.  **Question Formulation**: An LLM (GPT-3.5-turbo) generates object-level (existence, count) and attribute-level questions around the extracted concepts.\n        3.  **Visual Knowledge Validation**: Expert models answer the formulated questions: an open-set object detector (Grounding DINO) for object existence and counts, and a pre-trained VQA model (BLIP-2-FlanT5 XXL) for attribute-level questions.\n        4.  **Visual Claim Generation**: The validated QA pairs are combined into a structured visual knowledge base, comprising object-level and attribute-level claims about the image.\n        5.  **Hallucination Correction**: An LLM (GPT-3.5-turbo) uses this visual knowledge base to correct the original MLLM response, explicitly adding bounding box evidence for interpretability and fact-checking \\cite{yin2023hx3}.\n    *   **Novelty**: The approach is novel due to its training-free, post-remedy paradigm for hallucination correction, which contrasts with existing generative prevention methods. It offers high interpretability through its clear, transparent pipeline and the explicit inclusion of visual grounding (bounding boxes) in the corrected output \\cite{yin2023hx3}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Framework**: Proposes the first training-free, corrective framework (Woodpecker) to mitigate visual hallucinations in MLLMs, operating in a post-remedy manner \\cite{yin2023hx3}.\n    *   **System Design & Interpretability**: Designs a modular and transparent pipeline with five distinct stages, allowing for clear diagnosis and correction. The integration of bounding boxes directly into the corrected text enhances interpretability and facilitates visual fact-checking \\cite{yin2023hx3}.\n    *   **Leveraging Expert Models**: Effectively combines the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with the strong perception capabilities of specialized vision foundation models (e.g., open-set object detectors, VQA models) to validate visual facts \\cite{yin2023hx3}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: `\\cite{yin2023hx3}` evaluates Woodpecker quantitatively and qualitatively on benchmarks designed for MLLM hallucination.\n    *   **Datasets**: POPE `\\cite{yin2023hx3}` (object-level hallucination, \"Yes-or-No\" questions across random, popular, adversarial settings), MME `\\cite{yin2023hx3}` (object-level and attribute-level hallucination, \"Yes-or-No\" questions), and LLaVA-QA90 `\\cite{yin2023hx3}` (description-type queries, evaluated by GPT-4V for accuracy and detailedness).\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Yes Rate for POPE; a combined score (accuracy + accuracy+) for MME. For LLaVA-QA90, GPT-4V ratings on accuracy and detailedness.\n    *   **Comparison Results**: Woodpecker significantly boosts the accuracy of baseline MLLMs. For instance, on the POPE benchmark (random setting), it improved MiniGPT-4's accuracy from 54.67% to 85.33% (a 30.66% gain) and mPLUG-Owl's accuracy from 62.00% to 86.33% (a 24.33% gain) \\cite{yin2023hx3}. Similar improvements were observed across other baselines (LLaVA, Otter) and settings.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**: The performance of Woodpecker is inherently dependent on the accuracy and capabilities of the underlying expert models (GPT-3.5-turbo, Grounding DINO, BLIP-2-FlanT5 XXL) used in its pipeline.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: Woodpecker is designed as a post-remedy solution, correcting hallucinations *after* an MLLM has generated its response, rather than preventing them during generation. It primarily addresses visual hallucinations (object-level and attribute-level) in descriptive text \\cite{yin2023hx3}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: `\\cite{yin2023hx3}` introduces a novel, training-free paradigm for hallucination correction, offering a flexible and generalizable solution that can be applied to various MLLMs without retraining. This significantly advances the state-of-the-art beyond data-intensive instruction-tuning methods \\cite{yin2023hx3}.\n    *   **Potential Impact**: By substantially improving the factual consistency and interpretability of MLLM outputs, Woodpecker enhances the reliability of MLLMs for practical applications. Its modular and transparent design, coupled with explicit visual grounding, paves the way for future research into more robust and verifiable multimodal AI systems \\cite{yin2023hx3}.",

        "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced considerably, intertwining visual recognition and language understanding to generate content that is not only coherent but also contextually attuned. Despite their success, LVLMs still suffer from the issue of object hallucinations, where models generate plausible yet incorrect outputs that include objects that do not exist in the images. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Visual Contrastive Decoding (VCD), a simple and training-free method that contrasts output distributions derived from original and distorted visual inputs. The proposed VCD effectively reduces the over-reliance on statistical bias and unimodal priors, two essential causes of object hallucinations. This adjustment ensures the generated content is closely grounded to visual inputs, resulting in contextually accurate outputs. Our experiments show that VCD, without either additional training or the usage of external tools, significantly mitigates the object hallucination issue across different LVLM families. Beyond mitigating object hallucinations, VCD also excels in general LVLM benchmarks, highlighting its wide-ranging applicability.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \\cite{leng2023ohr} for a literature review:\n\n### Analysis of \"Mitigating Object Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models through Visual Contrastive Decoding\" \\cite{leng2023ohr}\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) suffer from \"object hallucinations,\" where they generate plausible but incorrect outputs containing objects not present in the image.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: This problem impacts the reliability and applicability of LVLMs, leading to misinformation and erroneous decision-making in critical domains (e.g., healthcare, autonomous systems). It stems from fundamental issues like LVLMs' over-reliance on statistical biases from training data and unimodal (language) priors embedded in their LLM components.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches**:\n        *   **Early VLMs**: Fine-grained modality alignment \\cite{leng2023ohr}, reducing statistical bias with data augmentation \\cite{leng2023ohr}. These are often impractical for modern LVLMs due to differing architectures and scale.\n        *   **Recent LVLMs**: Hallucination-targeted datasets for fine-tuning \\cite{leng2023ohr}, training post-hoc revisors \\cite{leng2023ohr}, or adapting factually augmented Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) \\cite{leng2023ohr}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Existing interventions for LVLMs are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and computationally costly, requiring additional training, new datasets, or external pretrained models.\n    *   **Positioning**: \\cite{leng2023ohr} proposes Visual Contrastive Decoding (VCD) as a simpler, training-free, and efficient approach that circumvents the need for additional training or external tools.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method (Visual Contrastive Decoding - VCD)**: VCD mitigates object hallucinations by contrasting output distributions derived from original and *distorted* visual inputs. This acts as a corrective mechanism to calibrate the model's over-reliance on language priors and statistical biases.\n    *   **Introduction of Visual Uncertainty**: Visual uncertainty is introduced by applying a Gaussian noise mask to the original image, following a forward diffusion process. This creates a distorted image `v'` from the original `v`.\n    *   **Mechanism of Amplification**: The paper empirically demonstrates that increased visual uncertainty (via distortion) amplifies LVLMs' reliance on language priors (e.g., favoring \"yellow\" for a banana even if it's black in a distorted image) and statistical biases (e.g., hallucinating frequent or co-occurring objects more often).\n    *   **Contrastive Probability Distribution**: The core of VCD is defined by:\n        `pvcd(y|v, v′, x) = softmax [(1 + α) logitθ(y|v, x) − α logitθ(y|v′, x)]`\n        where `α` controls the strength of the contrast, and `v'` is the distorted visual input. This formulation penalizes tokens that are highly probable under the distorted input (which is prone to hallucinations) relative to the original input.\n    *   **Adaptive Plausibility Constraints**: To prevent VCD from inadvertently promoting implausible tokens by indiscriminately penalizing all outputs from distorted inputs, an adaptive plausibility constraint is applied. This constraint prunes the candidate token pool `Vhead(y<t)` based on the confidence level of the output distribution with original visual inputs, ensuring only high-probability tokens are considered.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **In-depth Analysis**: Conducted an analysis demonstrating how visual uncertainty amplifies object hallucinations in LVLMs, specifically due to statistical bias and unimodal priors.\n    *   **Novel Training-Free Technique (VCD)**: Designed Visual Contrastive Decoding, a novel method that effectively mitigates object hallucinations by contrasting output distributions from original and distorted visual inputs, without requiring additional training or external models.\n    *   **Adaptive Plausibility Constraint**: Introduced an adaptive plausibility constraint to refine VCD, preventing the generation of implausible tokens and maintaining output integrity.\n    *   **Empirical Validation**: Demonstrated VCD's efficacy in alleviating object hallucination and enhancing general perception capabilities across various LVLM families.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Datasets**:\n        *   **POPE (Polling-based Object Probing Evaluation)** \\cite{leng2023ohr}: Assesses object hallucination by querying LVLMs on object existence. Includes three sampling settings: random, popular, and adversarial, aggregating data from MSCOCO, A-OKVQA, and GQA.\n        *   **MME**: An extensive benchmark for LVLMs covering perception and cognition subtasks.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**:\n        *   **POPE**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 score.\n        *   **MME**: General perception capacities.\n    *   **Comparison Results**:\n        *   **Object Hallucination Mitigation**: VCD significantly mitigates object hallucination, achieving up to a +7.4 F1 score boost on POPE and an +18% improvement on MME.\n        *   **General Perception**: Beyond hallucination mitigation, VCD also excels in general LVLM benchmarks (MME and LLaVA-Bench), indicating broader applicability.\n        *   **Model Agnostic**: Demonstrated consistent improvements across different LVLM families, including LLaVA-1.5 \\cite{leng2023ohr}, InstructBLIP \\cite{leng2023ohr}, and Qwen-VL \\cite{leng2023ohr}.\n        *   **Efficiency**: Achieves these improvements without additional training or external tools.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**: The method of introducing visual uncertainty (Gaussian noise mask) is described as \"elementary,\" suggesting potential for more sophisticated distortion methods. The adaptive plausibility constraint is crucial to prevent VCD from promoting implausible tokens, indicating that naive contrastive decoding could have adverse effects.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: While shown to be effective across different LVLM families and beneficial for general perception, the primary focus and validation are on mitigating object hallucinations.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art**: VCD offers a novel, training-free, and computationally efficient approach to a critical problem in LVLMs. By directly addressing the root causes (statistical bias and language priors) through a decoding-time intervention, it provides a practical alternative to costly fine-tuning or external model integration.\n    *   **Potential Impact**: This work opens avenues for future research into more sophisticated visual distortion techniques and adaptive contrastive decoding strategies. Its training-free nature makes it highly adaptable and deployable for improving the reliability of existing LVLMs in real-world applications without extensive retraining.",

        "title": "LongHalQA: Long-Context Hallucination Evaluation for MultiModal Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "Hallucination, a phenomenon where multimodal large language models~(MLLMs) tend to generate textual responses that are plausible but unaligned with the image, has become one major hurdle in various MLLM-related applications. Several benchmarks have been created to gauge the hallucination levels of MLLMs, by either raising discriminative questions about the existence of objects or introducing LLM evaluators to score the generated text from MLLMs. However, the discriminative data largely involve simple questions that are not aligned with real-world text, while the generative data involve LLM evaluators that are computationally intensive and unstable due to their inherent randomness. We propose LongHalQA, an LLM-free hallucination benchmark that comprises 6K long and complex hallucination text. LongHalQA is featured by GPT4V-generated hallucinatory data that are well aligned with real-world scenarios, including object/image descriptions and multi-round conversations with 14/130 words and 189 words, respectively, on average. It introduces two new tasks, hallucination discrimination and hallucination completion, unifying both discriminative and generative evaluations in a single multiple-choice-question form and leading to more reliable and efficient evaluations without the need for LLM evaluators. Further, we propose an advanced pipeline that greatly facilitates the construction of future hallucination benchmarks with long and complex questions and descriptions. Extensive experiments over multiple recent MLLMs reveal various new challenges when they are handling hallucinations with long and complex textual data.

This significantly compromises their reliability and applicability.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: Effective and efficient measurement of MLLM hallucination levels is crucial for diagnosis and mitigation. Existing benchmarks suffer from several limitations:\n        *   **Oversimplification**: Discriminative benchmarks use simple, short questions (e.g., \"Is there an {object}?\") that are not representative of real-world scenarios and fail to capture complex hallucination causes.\n        *   **Limited Variability**: Many benchmarks rely on off-the-shelf object annotations (e.g., COCO's 80 categories), leading to biased evaluations and limited scope of hallucination types.\n        *   **Computational Cost & Instability**: Generative benchmarks often employ LLM evaluators, which are computationally intensive, slow, and prone to instability due to their inherent randomness.\n        *   **Lack of Long-Context Evaluation**: Previous benchmarks largely ignore hallucinations in long, complex textual contexts, which are common in real-world MLLM applications like detailed descriptions or multi-round conversations.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches**: Previous work includes discriminative benchmarks (e.g., POPE, CIEM, AMBER) focusing on object existence/attributes with simple \"yes/no\" answers, and generative benchmarks (e.g., Hal-Eval, Kaul et al.) using LLM evaluators for free-form text analysis.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   Most discriminative benchmarks use short, simple questions and binary answers, failing to capture the nuances and causes of hallucinations.\n        *   Generative benchmarks are slow and unstable due to reliance on LLM evaluators.\n        *   Both types often have limited scope regarding hallucination types and object variability.\n        *   Crucially, they lack evaluation for long-context hallucinations, which are prevalent in advanced MLLM applications.\n    *   **Positioning of LongHalQA**: \\cite{qiu2024zyc} addresses these limitations by introducing an LLM-free, long-context hallucination benchmark that unifies discriminative and generative evaluations into an efficient multiple-choice question (MCQ) format, covering a broader range of complex hallucination types and real-world scenarios.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: \\cite{qiu2024zyc} proposes **LongHalQA**, an LLM-free hallucination benchmark with 6K long and complex hallucination texts, and **LongHallGen**, an automated pipeline for generating such data.\n    *   **Novelty**:\n        *   **Unified MCQ Format**: Introduces two novel tasks, **Hallucination Discrimination** and **Hallucination Completion**, both framed as multiple-choice questions. This unifies discriminative and generative evaluations, making them more reliable and efficient by eliminating the need for costly and unstable LLM evaluators.\n        *   **Long-Context Data**: Features three types of long-context data: Object-level Description (avg. 14 words), Image-level Description (avg. 130 words), and Multi-round Conversation (avg. 189 words). This is significantly longer and more complex than existing benchmarks, better simulating real-world MLLM usage.\n        *   **Broad Hallucination Coverage**: Categorizes and annotates 12 distinct types of hallucinations, including complex ones involving logic and contextual consistency (e.g., \"four such plates\" vs. \"five plates\"), which are often overlooked.\n        *   **Automated Data Generation Pipeline (LongHallGen)**: Proposes a generic pipeline that leverages GPT-4V with specific prompt templates to automatically generate long-context hallucinatory data, perform hallucination checks (with optional human verification), create hallucination-explanation pairs, and construct MCQs.

This suggests that COT's effectiveness is limited by MLLMs' long-context processing capabilities.\n        *   **MCQ vs. Free-form**: Experiments demonstrate that the MCQ hallucination completion task exhibits similar trends to free-form generative evaluation, while offering significantly higher evaluation speed, especially for large models.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**: The paper highlights that even state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4V, used for data generation, suffer from severe hallucinations when generating long-context data (e.g., 78.8% of image-level descriptions and 82.4% of conversations contained at least one hallucination). This necessitates a comprehensive hallucination check process within LongHallGen.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: LongHalQA focuses on long-context textual hallucinations related to object/image descriptions and multi-round conversations.

        "abstract": "Despite their impressive capabilities, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are prone to hallucinations, i.e., the generated content that is nonsensical or unfaithful to input sources. Unlike in LLMs, hallucinations in MLLMs often stem from the sensitivity of text decoder to visual tokens, leading to a phenomenon akin to\"amnesia\"about visual information. To address this issue, we propose MemVR, a novel decoding paradigm inspired by common cognition: when the memory of an image seen the moment before is forgotten, people will look at it again for factual answers. Following this principle, we treat visual tokens as supplementary evidence, re-injecting them into the MLLM through Feed Forward Network (FFN) as\"key-value memory\"at the middle trigger layer. This\"look-twice\"mechanism occurs when the model exhibits high uncertainty during inference, effectively enhancing factual alignment. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that MemVR significantly mitigates hallucination across various MLLMs and excels in general benchmarks without incurring additional time overhead.

However, hallucination, where models generate inaccurate or misleading content, remains underexplored in the video domain.

Comprehensive testing shows that most MLLMs are vulnerable to hallucinations across these dimensions. Furthermore, we propose DINO-HEAL, a training-free method that reduces hallucinations by incorporating spatial saliency from DINOv2 to reweight visual features during inference. Our results show that DINO-HEAL consistently improves performance on VIDHALLUC, achieving an average improvement of 3.02% in mitigating hallucinations across all tasks.

        "title": "VaLiD: Mitigating the Hallucination of Large Vision Language Models by Visual Layer Fusion Contrastive Decoding",
        "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in multimodal task reasoning. However, they often generate responses that appear plausible yet do not accurately reflect the visual content, a phenomenon known as hallucination. Recent approaches have introduced training-free methods to mitigate hallucinations by adjusting the decoding strategy during the inference stage, typically attributing hallucinations to the language model itself. Our analysis, however, reveals that distortions in the visual encoding process significantly affect the model's reasoning capabilities. Specifically, earlier visual layers may retain key features but gradually distort as the information propagates toward the output layer. Building on these insights, we propose a novel hallucination-mitigation method from the visual encoding perspective: \\textbf{V}isu\\textbf{a}l \\textbf{L}ayer Fus\\textbf{i}on Contrastive \\textbf{D}ecoding (\\textbf{VaLiD}). This method utilizes uncertainty to guide the visual layer selection, correcting distortions in the visual encoding process and thereby enhancing the reliability of the generated content.

Codes are available at \\href{https://github.com/RicardoLuL/VaLiD_LVLMs_hallucinations}{Github}.",
        "summary": "Here is a focused summary of the paper for a literature review:\n\n### Focused Summary for Literature Review\n\n#### 1. Research Problem & Motivation\n*   **Specific Technical Problem**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) frequently suffer from \"hallucination,\" where they generate plausible but factually incorrect responses that do not align with the visual input \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n*   **Importance and Challenge**: Hallucinations severely undermine the reliability of LVLMs, posing significant barriers to their deployment in real-world applications \\cite{wang2024vym}. Existing inference-stage mitigation methods primarily attribute hallucinations to the language model itself. However, this paper posits that distortions in the visual encoding process are a critical, overlooked source of these errors, making the problem more complex than previously assumed \\cite{wang2024vym}. The paper identifies \"Visual Encoding Distortion,\" where key visual features captured in earlier layers become distorted as they propagate towards the final output layer, leading to incorrect inferences \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n\n#### 2. Related Work & Positioning\n*   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Previous hallucination mitigation methods generally fall into three categories:\n    *   **Post-training steps**: Involve additional training with auxiliary supervision or reinforcement learning, which are computationally expensive and require large annotated datasets \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n    *   **Post-hoc correction**: Utilize auxiliary revision models or manual pipelines during inference, often facing challenges with high computational costs, complex implementation, and limited scalability \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n    *   **Decoding strategy modification**: Intervene during the inference phase by adjusting the decoding strategy, reducing computational costs. However, these methods typically assume the language model is the primary source of hallucinations, focusing on language priors or statistical biases \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n*   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Existing inference-time decoding strategies largely overlook the impact of the visual encoding process on hallucinations \\cite{wang2024vym}. They fail to address the \"Visual Encoding Distortion\" phenomenon, where crucial visual information is corrupted before reaching the language model, leading to errors even with sophisticated decoding strategies focused solely on the language component \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n\n#### 3. Technical Approach & Innovation\n*   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes Visual-Layer Fusion Contrastive Decoding (VaLiD), a novel hallucination mitigation method that addresses distortions from the vision encoder perspective \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n    *   **Uncertainty-guided Visual-Layer Fusion**: VaLiD leverages uncertainty (measured by the entropy of the next token's probability distribution) to identify visual layers where encoding distortion occurs \\cite{wang2024vym}. Instead of relying on a single layer, it dynamically selects and fuses features from the top-k early visual layers exhibiting high uncertainty. This fusion is entropy-weighted to create a robust reference distribution \\cite{wang2024vym}. To ensure computational efficiency, visual layers are partitioned into \"buckets,\" and the optimal bucket is determined via a validation set \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n    *   **Contrastive Decoding**: VaLiD then applies a contrastive decoding approach. It contrasts the next token distribution from the standard visual output layer (Pori) with the fused reference distribution (Pref) derived from the selected early visual layers. This contrastive process generates a corrected probability distribution (Pvalid) that mitigates the adverse effects of inaccurate visual information \\cite{wang2024vym}. An adaptive reliability constraint is also incorporated to prevent penalizing valid outputs and ensure adherence to language standards \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n*   **Novelty**: VaLiD is novel because it is the first visual-centric hallucination mitigation approach that traces the origin of hallucinations to the vision encoder's internal processing \\cite{wang2024vym}. It introduces the concept of \"Visual Encoding Distortion\" and provides a mechanism (uncertainty-guided layer fusion) to identify and correct these distortions by integrating information from multiple visual layers, rather than solely relying on the final visual output or language model adjustments \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n\n#### 4. Key Technical Contributions\n*   **Novel Phenomenon Identification**: Emphasizes the critical role of the vision encoder and identifies \"Visual Encoding Distortion\" as a common phenomenon across different LVLMs, where visual information degrades as it propagates through layers \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n*   **Visual-Centric Mitigation Method**: Introduces VaLiD, the first hallucination mitigation approach that directly addresses issues within the visual encoding process, shifting the focus from solely the language model to the vision encoder \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n*   **Uncertainty-Guided Layer Fusion**: Proposes a novel mechanism for dynamically selecting and fusing visual features from early layers based on their uncertainty, providing a more robust reference for contrastive decoding \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n*   **Enhanced Contrastive Decoding**: Integrates this visual-layer fusion into a contrastive decoding framework, effectively correcting distorted visual information and improving the reliability of generated content \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n\n#### 5. Experimental Validation\n*   **Experiments Conducted**: VaLiD was integrated with three representative LVLMs: InstructBLIP-7B, LLaVA-v1.5-7B, and Qwen-VL-7B \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n*   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n    *   **Benchmarks**: Evaluated on three hallucination benchmarks: POPE (assessing object existence hallucination across MS-COCO, A-OKVQA, GQA datasets), AMBER (fine-grained evaluation of existence, attribute, and relational hallucinations), and MME (comprehensive benchmark covering 14 tasks, with focus on existence, count, location, and color subsets for hallucination assessment) \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n    *   **Metrics**: Accuracy (Acc.), F1-score, and Yes Accuracy (Yes Acc.) for POPE; Acc. and F1 for AMBER; and specific task scores for MME \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n    *   **Comparison**: Compared against baseline methods including Vanilla decoding and other contrastive decoding approaches like VCD, M3ID, and Ritual \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n    *   **Results**: VaLiD consistently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in mitigating hallucinations across various benchmarks and LVLMs. For instance, on POPE, VaLiD generally achieved higher Acc. and F1 scores across all datasets and negative sampling strategies compared to baselines \\cite{wang2024vym}. It effectively reduced object-level and attribute-level hallucinations without compromising the model's general reasoning capabilities on other MME tasks \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n\n#### 6. Limitations & Scope\n*   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The method relies on the assumption that earlier visual layers retain key features that become distorted later, and that uncertainty is a reliable indicator of this distortion \\cite{wang2024vym}. While the paper demonstrates this empirically, the theoretical underpinnings of why uncertainty correlates with distortion could be further explored.\n*   **Scope of Applicability**: VaLiD is designed for LVLMs that utilize Vision Transformers (ViT) as their visual encoder, as it operates by accessing and fusing features from different hidden layers of the ViT backbone \\cite{wang2024vym}. Its direct applicability to LVLMs with fundamentally different visual encoder architectures might require adaptation. The \"bucketing\" strategy for layer selection, while improving efficiency, implies a trade-off that needs careful validation for optimal performance \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n\n#### 7. Technical Significance\n*   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: VaLiD significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in hallucination mitigation by introducing a novel visual-centric perspective, moving beyond language-model-centric approaches \\cite{wang2024vym}. It provides a concrete method to identify and correct visual encoding distortions, a previously underexplored root cause of LVLM hallucinations \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n*   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: This work opens new avenues for research into the internal workings of vision encoders within LVLMs. It suggests that future efforts in improving LVLM reliability should not only focus on language model biases or post-hoc corrections but also on ensuring the integrity of visual information throughout the encoding process. It could inspire further investigations into dynamic layer selection, uncertainty quantification in multimodal models, and more sophisticated visual feature fusion techniques for robust multimodal reasoning \\cite{wang2024vym}.",

        "abstract": "Hallucination is a common problem for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with long generations which is difficult to eradicate. The generation with hallucinations is partially inconsistent with the image content. To mitigate hallucination, current studies either focus on the process of model inference or the results of model generation, but the solutions they design sometimes do not deal appropriately with various types of queries and the hallucinations of the generations about these queries. To accurately deal with various hallucinations, we present a unified framework, Dentist, for hallucination mitigation. The core step is to first classify the queries, then perform different processes of hallucination mitigation based on the classification result, just like a dentist first observes the teeth and then makes a plan. In a simple deployment, Dentist can classify queries as perception or reasoning and easily mitigate potential hallucinations in answers which has been demonstrated in our experiments. On MMbench, we achieve a 13.44%/10.2%/15.8% improvement in accuracy on Image Quality, a Coarse Perception visual question answering (VQA) task, over the baseline InstructBLIP/LLaVA/VisualGLM.",

This includes both \"perception hallucination\" (incorrectly describing visual attributes) and \"reasoning hallucination\" (producing fallacies in logical reasoning based on the image).\n    *   **Importance & Challenge**: Hallucinations lead to misinformation, degrade user experience, and undermine the reliability of LVLMs. Existing mitigation methods often employ a fixed verification approach, which is ineffective or inappropriate for the diverse types of hallucinations arising from different query types (e.g., object detection is not suitable for reasoning queries). Furthermore, current methods may not fully eradicate hallucinations in a single pass, sometimes leading to inconsistent corrections \\cite{chang2024u3t}.\n\n*   **2. Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Previous work on hallucination mitigation generally falls into two categories: optimizing model training/inference (e.g., RLHF-V, VIGC) or correcting hallucinations during the generation stage without model updates (e.g., Woodpecker, HalluciDoctor) \\cite{chang2024u3t}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Existing methods overlook the diversity of hallucinations. They apply a \"one-size-fits-all\" verification strategy, which is suboptimal for different query types (perception vs. reasoning). For instance, methods relying on object detection are effective for perceptual errors but fail for complex reasoning errors. This fixed approach can lead to partial or inconsistent corrections \\cite{chang2024u3t}.\n\n*   **3.

This classification determines the type of potential hallucination in the LVLM's answer.\n        *   **Divide-and-Conquer Treatment**:\n            *   **Visual Verification for Perception Queries**: For perception-based queries, the original LVLM's long descriptive answer is broken down into sub-questions by ChatGPT. These sub-questions are then answered by the *original* LVLM (to demonstrate mitigation ability, not just a better VQA model), and the sub-answers are aggregated by ChatGPT to refine the original hallucinated response.\n            *   **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for Reasoning Queries**: For reasoning-based queries, a \"Let’s think step by step\" CoT prompt is added to the original query for the LVLM. ChatGPT then uses the LVLM's CoT-enhanced generation to correct the original answer, providing more detailed logical reasoning.\n        *   **Validation Loop**: The entire verification process is embedded in a loop. The revised answer from one iteration becomes the input for the next.

        "abstract": "Despite the recent breakthroughs achieved by Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) in understanding and responding to complex visual-textual contexts, their inherent hallucination tendencies limit their practical application in real-world scenarios that demand high levels of precision. Existing methods typically either fine-tune the LVLMs using additional data, which incurs extra costs in manual annotation and computational resources or perform comparisons at the decoding stage, which may eliminate useful language priors for reasoning while introducing inference time overhead. Therefore, we propose ICT, a lightweight, training-free method that calculates an intervention direction to shift the model’s focus towards different levels of visual information, enhancing its attention to high-level and fine-grained visual details. During the forward pass stage, the intervention is applied to the attention heads that encode the overall image information and the fine-grained object details, effectively mitigating the phenomenon of overly language priors, and thereby alleviating hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ICT achieves strong performance with a small amount of data and generalizes well across different datasets and models.

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n### Analysis of \"ICT: Image-Object Cross-Level Trusted Intervention for Mitigating Object Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models\" \\cite{chen2024j0g}\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) frequently suffer from \"object hallucination,\" where they generate text inconsistent with visual input, such as incorrectly identifying object presence or inaccurately describing attributes \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: This hallucination tendency severely limits the practical application of LVLMs in real-world scenarios demanding high precision (e.g., autonomous driving, medical surgery) \\cite{chen2024j0g}. The problem is challenging due to:\n        *   **Overly Strong Language Priors**: Powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) within LVLMs often dominate weaker visual encoders, leading to an excessive reliance on language cues over visual input \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n        *   **Lack of Fine-Grained Visual Semantics**: Current visual decoders struggle to capture detailed visual features, resulting in errors regarding object attributes like color and quantity \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches**: Previous efforts to mitigate hallucinations generally fall into three categories:\n        *   **Fine-tuning with additional data**: Involves introducing high-quality annotated data to align model behavior with human interpretations \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n            *   *Limitations*: Requires costly manual annotation, substantial computational resources for model parameter updates, and limits scalability \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n        *   **Perceptual enhancement**: Incorporates auxiliary information (e.g., depth maps, segmentation maps) to assist visual encoders \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n            *   *Limitations*: Often requires manual selection of auxiliary features, limiting generalizability across tasks \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n        *   **Contrastive decoding (CD)**: Induces hallucinations (e.g., via blurring) and penalizes associated tokens during the decoding stage to mitigate language priors \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n            *   *Limitations*: Indiscriminately eliminates *all* language priors, including potentially beneficial ones, which can inadvertently lead to new hallucinations \\cite{chen2024j0g}. Also introduces inference time overhead \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n    *   **Positioning of this Work**: `\\cite{chen2024j0g}` proposes ICT, a novel, lightweight, training-free, and plug-and-play method that operates during the *forward pass*, unlike contrastive decoding methods. It enhances the model's focus on visual details without eliminating useful language priors and introduces no additional inference latency. It specifically targets the \"severely underexploited\" activation space during inference \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method (ICT)**: Image-Object Cross-Level Trusted Intervention \\cite{chen2024j0g} is a training-free, plug-and-play method that calculates an \"intervention direction\" to shift the model's focus towards different levels of visual information during the forward pass.\n    *   **Mechanism**: `\\cite{chen2024j0g}` identifies activation value deviations in attention heads that can shift the model from \"untrustworthy\" to \"trustworthy\" responses. It then applies targeted interventions to these heads.\n    *   **Two Levels of Intervention**:\n        *   **Image-Level Intervention**: Aims to enhance the model's focus on overall visual information to reduce over-reliance on language priors. It constructs trusted (original image) and untrusted (globally blurred image) data pairs, calculates an activation shift vector based on their differences, and trains binary classifiers (SVMs) for each attention head to identify those encoding overall image information. The shift is then applied to these selected heads \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n        *   **Object-Level Intervention**: Focuses on increasing attention to fine-grained object details to mitigate hallucinations caused by the omission of critical objects. It uses Grounding DINO to identify object regions, creates trusted (original image) and untrusted (locally blurred object region) data pairs, calculates an object-level activation shift vector, and trains binary classifiers to identify heads distinguishing these object-focused pairs. The shift is applied to these selected heads \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n    *   **Unified Approach**: Both Image-Level and Object-Level interventions are integrated by summing their respective shifts on selected attention heads, providing a balanced attention mechanism \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   **Forward Pass Intervention**: Operates during the forward pass, making it orthogonal and complementary to existing decoding strategies and introducing no additional latency \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n        *   **Targeted Head-Level Intervention**: Identifies and intervenes on specific attention heads responsible for encoding different levels of visual information (overall image vs. fine-grained objects) using binary classifiers \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n        *   **Preservation of Language Priors**: Enhances visual focus without indiscriminately eliminating beneficial language priors, a key limitation of contrastive decoding \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n        *   **Training-Free**: Does not require additional training or fine-tuning of the LVLM parameters \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   Proposes ICT \\cite{chen2024j0g}, a novel, training-free, plug-and-play method that effectively reduces hallucinations in LVLMs by enhancing focus on both overall visual information and fine-grained object details during the forward pass.\n    *   Introduces an intervention mechanism that operates during the forward pass, offering an alternative to decoding-stage methods and avoiding additional inference latency \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n    *   Develops a method to identify and target specific attention heads responsible for encoding different levels of visual information using binary classifiers and activation shift vectors derived from trusted/untrusted data pairs \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n    *   Demonstrates a balanced attention mechanism that mitigates excessive reliance on language priors while preserving useful ones \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Models Evaluated**: LLaVA-v1.5 \\cite{chen2024j0g} and Qwen-VL \\cite{chen2024j0g} were used as baseline LVLMs.\n    *   **Datasets**:\n        *   **POPE \\cite{chen2024j0g} (Polling-based Object Probing Evaluation)**: Used to assess object-level hallucinations with Yes/No questions. Metrics include Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 score. 1,500 QA pairs from the COCO Random subset were used to train intervention shift vectors \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n        *   **MME \\cite{chen2024j0g} (Multimodal Large Language Model Evaluation)**: A comprehensive benchmark evaluating LVLMs across perception and cognition tasks, including object existence, count, position, and color. The evaluation metric is Accuracy \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n    *   **Baselines for Comparison**: VCD \\cite{chen2024j0g} and Opera \\cite{chen2024j0g}, both decoding-stage methods, were compared.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Results**:\n        *   ICT \\cite{chen2024j0g} achieved an average improvement of 6.27% on the POPE benchmark and 67.37 points on the MME benchmark for LLaVA-v1.5 \\cite{chen2024j0g} and Qwen-VL \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n        *   The method demonstrated strong performance with a small amount of data used for intervention vector calculation \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n        *   ICT \\cite{chen2024j0g} exhibited cross-dataset and model-agnostic generalizability \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The paper implicitly relies on the ability of binary classifiers (SVMs) to accurately identify attention heads encoding specific levels of visual information. The effectiveness of Grounding DINO for object localization is also a prerequisite for the Object-Level intervention \\cite{chen2024j0g}. The pre-computation of intervention vectors requires a small, representative dataset.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: ICT \\cite{chen2024j0g} is applicable to mitigating object and attribute hallucinations in LVLMs. It has been validated on LLaVA-v1.5 \\cite{chen2024j0g} and Qwen-VL \\cite{chen2024j0g} and shows generalizability across different datasets and models.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art**: `\\cite{chen2024j0g}` significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by introducing a novel, efficient, and effective training-free method for hallucination mitigation that operates directly in the forward pass. This addresses key limitations of prior approaches, such as computational cost, data dependency, and the indiscriminate removal of beneficial language priors \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n        *   Opens new avenues for research into understanding and manipulating the internal activation space of LVLMs during inference to improve trustworthiness and control model behavior.\n        *   Provides a plug-and-play solution that can be easily integrated into existing LVLM pipelines without extensive retraining, making it highly practical for real-world deployment.\n        *   Encourages further exploration of targeted, fine-grained interventions within transformer architectures for various multimodal challenges.",

        "abstract": "Although Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated exceptional abilities in understanding multimodal data, they invariably suffer from hallucinations, leading to a disconnect between the generated text and the corresponding images. Almost all current visual contrastive decoding methods attempt to mitigate these hallucinations by introducing visual uncertainty information that appropriately widens the contrastive logits gap between hallucinatory and targeted ones. However, due to uncontrollable nature of the global visual uncertainty, they struggle to precisely induce the hallucinatory tokens, which severely limits their effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and may even lead to the generation of undesired hallucinations. To tackle this issue, we conducted the theoretical analysis to promote the effectiveness of contrast decoding. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel optimization strategy named Hallucination-Induced Optimization (HIO). This strategy seeks to amplify the contrast between hallucinatory and targeted tokens relying on a fine-tuned theoretical preference model (i.e., Contrary Bradley-Terry Model), thereby facilitating efficient contrast decoding to alleviate hallucinations in LVLMs. Extensive experimental research demonstrates that our HIO strategy can effectively reduce hallucinations in LVLMs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Visual hallucination (VH) means that a multi-modal LLM (MLLM) imagines incorrect details about an image in visual question answering. Existing studies find VH instances only in existing image datasets, which results in biased understanding of MLLMs' performance under VH due to limited diversity of such VH instances. In this work, we propose a tool called VHTest to generate a diverse set of VH instances. Specifically, VHTest finds some initial VH instances in existing image datasets (e.g., COCO), generates a text description for each VH mode, and uses a text-to-image generative model (e.g., DALL-E-3) to generate VH images based on the text descriptions. We collect a benchmark dataset with 1,200 VH instances in 8 VH modes using VHTest. We find that existing MLLMs such as GPT-4V, LLaVA-1.5, and MiniGPT-v2 hallucinate for a large fraction of the instances in our benchmark. Moreover, we find that fine-tuning an MLLM using our benchmark dataset reduces its likelihood to hallucinate without sacrificing its performance on other benchmarks. Our benchmarks are publicly available: https://github.com/wenhuang2000/VHTest.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review, emphasizing technical innovations and empirical validation:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently suffer from Visual Hallucination (VH), where they generate factually incorrect details about an image during visual question answering.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge**: VH poses a significant obstacle to developing safe and trustworthy AI. Existing methods for identifying VH instances are limited to pre-existing image datasets (e.g., COCO), which results in a lack of diversity in VH instances and potential data contamination (if MLLMs were pre-trained on these datasets). This leads to a biased and often over-optimistic understanding of MLLMs' true VH performance.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Prior works have benchmarked MLLM VHs related to object existence, OCR, counting, position, orientation, and viewpoint \\cite{huang20247wn}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: These studies primarily collect VH images from existing datasets, which restricts the diversity of VH scenarios and introduces the risk of data contamination, leading to an inaccurate assessment of MLLM robustness against hallucination \\cite{huang20247wn}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes `VHTest`, a novel tool designed for the adversarial generation of a diverse set of VH instances \\cite{huang20247wn}. The process involves three key steps:\n        1.  **Step I: Finding Initial VH Instances**: Identifies image pairs from existing datasets (e.g., COCO) that exhibit high cosine similarity in CLIP embeddings but low similarity in DINO v2 embeddings. These contradictory similarities indicate potential VH triggers. Initial questions and reference answers are manually designed for these candidates \\cite{huang20247wn}.\n        2.  **Step II: Text Description Generation**: Leverages an MLLM (e.g., GPT-4V) to generate detailed text descriptions for each VH mode. These descriptions are derived from successful (or hypothetically constructed for unsuccessful) initial VH instances, aiming to explain potential causes of hallucination and guide the generation of new images \\cite{huang20247wn}.\n        3.  **Step III: Generating More VH Instances**: Utilizes a text-to-image generative model (e.g., DALL·E-3) to create novel VH images based on the text descriptions from Step II. Human workers then formulate specific questions and reference answers for these generated images using object-driven templates, ensuring non-ambiguity \\cite{huang20247wn}.\n    *   **Novelty**: `VHTest` introduces an adversarial construction paradigm for VH instances, moving beyond passive collection from existing datasets. Its innovation lies in systematically generating *new, diverse, and uncontaminated* VH images using text-to-image models, guided by MLLM-generated descriptions of hallucination modes. It also introduces `shape` and `size` as new VH modes \\cite{huang20247wn}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithm/Method**: The `VHTest` pipeline itself, which systematically combines vision encoders, MLLMs, and text-to-image generative models for adversarial VH instance generation \\cite{huang20247wn}.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: The integrated architecture that uses CLIP and DINO v2 for initial instance identification, an MLLM for abstracting VH modes into text descriptions, and DALL·E-3 for synthesizing diverse VH images \\cite{huang20247wn}.\n    *   **Benchmark Dataset**: Construction of a new, publicly available benchmark dataset comprising 1,200 VH instances across 8 distinct VH modes (existence, shape, color, orientation, OCR, size, position, counting).

        "title": "Aligning Modalities in Vision Large Language Models via Preference Fine-tuning",
        "abstract": "Instruction-following Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) have achieved significant progress recently on a variety of tasks. These approaches merge strong pre-trained vision models and large language models (LLMs). Since these components are trained separately, the learned representations need to be aligned with joint training on additional image-language pairs. This procedure is not perfect and can cause the model to hallucinate - provide answers that do not accurately reflect the image, even when the core LLM is highly factual and the vision backbone has sufficiently complete representations. In this work, we frame the hallucination problem as an alignment issue, tackle it with preference tuning. Specifically, we propose POVID to generate feedback data with AI models. We use ground-truth instructions as the preferred response and a two-stage approach to generate dispreferred data. First, we prompt GPT-4V to inject plausible hallucinations into the correct answer. Second, we distort the image to trigger the inherent hallucination behavior of the VLLM. This is an automated approach, which does not rely on human data generation or require a perfect expert, which makes it easily scalable. Finally, both of these generation strategies are integrated into an RLHF pipeline via Direct Preference Optimization. In experiments across broad benchmarks, we show that we can not only reduce hallucinations, but improve model performance across standard benchmarks, outperforming prior approaches. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/YiyangZhou/POVID.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \"Aligning Modalities in Vision Large Language Models via Preference Fine-tuning\" \\cite{zhou2024wbi} for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) frequently suffer from \"hallucinations,\" where they generate content (e.g., imagined objects, incorrect relationships, wrong categories) that is not grounded in the input image. This occurs even when the underlying LLM is factual and the vision backbone provides complete representations.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: Hallucinations pose significant risks in high-stakes applications like medical diagnostics or autonomous driving. The problem is challenging because it stems from a misalignment between separately trained vision and language components, leading VLLMs to prioritize common sense or stereotypes from language data over actual visual input. Existing preference tuning methods often struggle with VLLMs because both preferred and dispreferred responses might be incorrect, making accurate image-text alignment difficult.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches**: Prior work includes reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) frameworks.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   Concurrent DPO works (e.g., Li et al., 2023d; Zhao et al., 2023) typically generate both preferred and dispreferred responses, where *both* might be incorrect for the given image-centric task, hindering effective alignment.\n        *   Approaches relying on human feedback (e.g., Yu et al., 2023a) are effective but incur significant costs and are not easily scalable.\n        *   These methods often fail to explicitly address the unique challenge of generating preference data for VLLMs, where responses are inherently linked to image data.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes **POVID (Preference Optimization in VLLM with AI-Generated Dispreferences)**, a novel framework that tackles VLLM hallucination by framing it as a modality alignment issue and addressing it with preference tuning. POVID exclusively generates *dispreferred* feedback data using AI models, while treating ground-truth instructions as preferred responses.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**: POVID's key innovation lies in its two-stage, automated approach to generating dispreferred responses, eliminating the need for human labeling:\n        1.  **Hallucinating Textual Responses**: Utilizes GPT-4V to inject plausible hallucinations into the *correct* ground-truth answer. This is tailored for different tasks:\n            *   For image captioning, it introduces errors related to object co-occurrence, logical relationships between entities, and incorrect entity attributes.\n            *   For reasoning tasks (VQA), it modifies the reasoning process itself, introducing logical errors while attempting to keep changes subtle.\n        2.  **Mitigating Inherent Hallucination Patterns**: Introduces controlled diffusion noise into the input image during training. This noise disrupts the VLLM's visual comprehension, provoking its *inherent* hallucination patterns (e.g., prioritizing textual context or learned associations over visual cues). The responses generated under these noisy conditions are treated as dispreferred.\n    *   **Integration**: Both types of AI-generated dispreferences are integrated into a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) framework via a reformulated loss function (L_POVID), which balances preferred and dispreferred terms. The noise-triggered dispreferred responses are conditioned on prior tokens from the preferred response to control reliability.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**: The POVID framework for VLLM preference optimization.\n    *   **Data Generation Technique**: A scalable, automated, two-stage AI-generated dispreference data creation process, leveraging GPT-4V for textual hallucination injection and diffusion noise for triggering inherent VLLM hallucinations.\n    *   **Optimization Formulation**: A reformulated DPO loss (L_POVID) that effectively combines dispreferences from both textual manipulation and image distortion, specifically designed for VLLM modality alignment.\n    *   **Mechanism for Inherent Hallucination**: A method to provoke and correct inherent hallucination patterns in the target VLLM by introducing controlled noise to the input image during real-time training.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: The authors conducted experiments across a broad range of VLLM benchmarks to evaluate POVID's effectiveness in reducing hallucinations and improving overall performance.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   **Benchmarks**: SciQA-IMG, MMBench, MM-Vet, LLaVA-Bench, 100-CHAIRS, 100-CHAIRi, and POPEMMHal.\n        *   **Comparison**: POVID was compared against LLaVA-1.5 (baseline) and other preference learning approaches for VLLMs, including Vlfeedback, Human-Preference, and RLHF-V.\n        *   **Results**: POVID significantly outperformed prior approaches, achieving an average performance improvement of 12.4% across the evaluated benchmarks. The results demonstrate that POVID not only reduces hallucinations but also enhances overall VLLM performance and redirects the model's attention towards the image modality, leading to better alignment.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The approach relies on the quality and controllability of GPT-4V for generating plausible textual hallucinations and the effectiveness of diffusion noise in reliably triggering *inherent* VLLM hallucinations within a \"reasonable range\" where the image remains recognizable. The specific hyperparameters for noise steps (`k`) and loss coefficients (`α, β1, β2`) are crucial for performance.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: POVID is primarily applicable to VLLMs that require improved modality alignment and hallucination reduction, particularly in tasks like image captioning and visual question answering. Its automated nature makes it suitable for large-scale deployment.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: POVID significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in VLLM alignment and hallucination mitigation by introducing a novel, automated, and scalable preference tuning framework. It moves beyond costly human feedback and addresses the unique challenges of preference data generation for image-centric models.\n    *   **Potential Impact**: This work has the potential to enable the development of more reliable, factual, and trustworthy VLLMs, making them safer for deployment in critical applications. It opens new avenues for research into automated, AI-driven feedback generation for multimodal models and more sophisticated techniques for aligning disparate modalities.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized language processing, but face critical challenges with security, privacy, and generating hallucinations — coherent but factually inaccurate outputs. A major issue is fact-conflicting hallucination (FCH), where LLMs produce content contradicting ground truth facts. Addressing FCH is difficult due to two key challenges: 1) Automatically constructing and updating benchmark datasets is hard, as existing methods rely on manually curated static benchmarks that cannot cover the broad, evolving spectrum of FCH cases. 2) Validating the reasoning behind LLM outputs is inherently difficult, especially for complex logical relations. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel logic-programming-aided metamorphic testing technique for FCH detection. We develop an extensive and extensible framework that constructs a comprehensive factual knowledge base by crawling sources like Wikipedia, seamlessly integrated into Drowzee. Using logical reasoning rules, we transform and augment this knowledge into a large set of test cases with ground truth answers. We test LLMs on these cases through template-based prompts, requiring them to provide reasoned answers. To validate their reasoning, we propose two semantic-aware oracles that assess the similarity between the semantic structures of the LLM answers and ground truth. Our approach automatically generates useful test cases and identifies hallucinations across six LLMs within nine domains, with hallucination rates ranging from 24.7% to 59.8%. Key findings include LLMs struggling with temporal concepts, out-of-distribution knowledge, and lack of logical reasoning capabilities. The results show that logic-based test cases generated by Drowzee effectively trigger and detect hallucinations. To further mitigate the identified FCHs, we explored model editing techniques, which proved effective on a small scale (with edits to fewer than 1000 knowledge pieces). Our findings emphasize the need for continued community efforts to detect and mitigate model hallucinations.",

        "abstract": "Vision language models (VLMs) perceive the world through a combination of a visual encoder and a large language model (LLM). The visual encoder, pre-trained on large-scale vision-text datasets, provides zero-shot generalization to visual data, and the LLM endows its high reasoning ability to VLMs. It leads VLMs to achieve high performance on wide benchmarks without fine-tuning, exhibiting zero or few-shot capability. However, recent studies show that VLMs are vulnerable to hallucination. This undesirable behavior degrades reliability and credibility, thereby making users unable to fully trust the output from VLMs. To enhance trustworthiness and better tackle the hallucination of VLMs, we curate a new evaluation dataset, called the BEfore-AFter hallucination dataset (BEAF), and introduce new metrics: True Understanding (TU), IGnorance (IG), StuBbornness (SB), and InDecision (ID). Unlike prior works that focus only on constructing questions and answers, the key idea of our benchmark is to manipulate visual scene information by image editing models and to design the metrics based on scene changes. This allows us to clearly assess whether VLMs correctly understand a given scene by observing the ability to perceive changes. We also visualize image-wise object relationship by virtue of our two-axis view: vision and text. Upon evaluating VLMs with our dataset, we observed that our metrics reveal different aspects of VLM hallucination that have not been reported before.

This includes incorrectly asserting the presence of objects not depicted in the image.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** This hallucination significantly degrades the reliability and credibility of VLMs, hindering genuine communication and eroding user trust \\cite{yebin2024txh}. Addressing this is crucial for improving system trustworthiness, especially in sensitive applications. The challenge lies in developing a comprehensive assessment framework that can deeply explore the underlying causes of hallucination in multi-modal VLMs, which process both visual and textual information.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches:** Prior hallucination benchmarks, such as POPE \\cite{yebin2024txh}, CIEM \\cite{yebin2024txh}, and AMBER \\cite{yebin2024txh}, typically adopt a Visual Question Answering (VQA) style. They provide simple question-and-answer (QnA) evaluations, often using discriminative (yes/no, multi-choice) or generative (open-ended caption) question types.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:** These prior studies primarily focus on \"text-axis\" evaluation, manipulating only the textual aspects of questions and answers \\cite{yebin2024txh}. This approach is insufficient for a thorough analysis of hallucination in VLMs, which inherently handle both visual and text modalities. It makes it difficult to disentangle the true sources of hallucination, particularly when objects frequently co-occur, preventing a clear assessment of whether VLMs genuinely understand scene information or merely rely on learned associations \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper proposes the BEfore-AFter (BEAF) hallucination evaluation benchmark, which innovatively manipulates visual scene information in addition to augmenting textual questions \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n        *   **Vision-axis Manipulation:** The core idea involves manipulating visual scenes by selectively removing objects from original images. This is achieved through a three-stage pipeline: automatic object removal using mask extraction (SAM) and inpainting (LaMa), followed by a filtering stage, and finally, human-guided manipulation to refine images and eliminate artifacts \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n        *   **Change-aware Metrics:** New evaluation metrics are introduced to assess how VLM answers change in response to these visual manipulations.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:**\n        *   **Multi-modal Evaluation:** BEAF uniquely evaluates VLMs along both vision and text axes, providing a more granular and comprehensive analysis of hallucination compared to previous text-axis-only methods \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n        *   **Perception of Change:** The benchmark's key innovation is its ability to observe whether VLMs correctly perceive and adapt their answers to explicit visual scene changes (e.g., an object being removed), thereby assessing true understanding rather than mere memorization or statistical correlation \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n        *   **Novel Metrics:** The introduction of True Understanding (TU), IGnorance (IG), StuBbornness (SB), and InDecision (ID) provides specific, change-aware measures to characterize different facets of VLM hallucinatory behavior \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Benchmark & Dataset:** Introduction of the BEAF benchmark, which includes a dataset of 500 original and 1,727 meticulously manipulated images (derived from MS-COCO), paired with 26,118 image-question pairs, enabling evaluation across both vision and text axes \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n    *   **Novel Change-aware Metrics:** Development of four new metrics for detailed hallucination evaluation:\n        *   **True Understanding (TU):** Measures if a model correctly answers for a removed object both before (present) and after (absent) manipulation \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n        *   **IGnorance (IG):** Quantifies instances where models consistently provide incorrect answers regarding removed objects \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n        *   **StuBbornness (SB):** Identifies cases where models give the same answer despite a visual change that should alter the ground truth for removed objects \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n        *   **InDecision (ID):** Captures situations where answers change even when the target object remains unchanged or was never present in the image \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n    *   **Robust Image Manipulation Pipeline:** A three-stage pipeline for creating high-quality manipulated images, combining automatic object removal (using SAM for masks and LaMa for inpainting) with human filtering and refinement to ensure artifact-free results \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n    *   **Visualization of Object Relationships:** The framework facilitates visualizing the impact of relationships between objects within hallucinatory images based on the BEAF evaluation results \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** The paper evaluates various Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using the curated BEAF dataset and the newly proposed change-aware metrics \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results:**\n        *   Evaluation utilizes the novel metrics (TU, IG, SB, ID) alongside traditional metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n        *   **Key Findings:** The BEAF metrics reveal distinct aspects of VLM hallucination that were not previously reported or detectable by existing text-axis-only evaluation methods \\cite{yebin2024txh}. Notably, outcomes previously considered non-hallucinatory by prior benchmarks are shown to potentially be hallucinations when assessed with the BEAF framework \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n        *   The study also includes an analysis of the influence of individual objects within a scene and a discussion on open-generation answers and CLIPScore results \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** While not explicitly detailed as limitations in the provided text, the reliance on a meticulous human-guided manipulation stage for dataset creation implies that fully automated, high-fidelity object removal without any detectable artifacts remains a significant challenge \\cite{yebin2024txh}. The dataset's foundation on MS-COCO might also limit its generalizability to broader or more complex real-world visual scenarios.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The BEAF benchmark is specifically designed for a granular evaluation of hallucination in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by assessing their ability to perceive and respond to explicit visual scene changes \\cite{yebin2024txh}. It is particularly applicable to models that integrate both visual and textual inputs and aims to provide a deeper understanding of their multi-modal reasoning and perception capabilities.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** BEAF significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in VLM hallucination evaluation by introducing a multi-modal assessment framework that incorporates vision-axis manipulations, moving beyond the limitations of text-only evaluations \\cite{yebin2024txh}. This provides a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of VLM behavior, uncovering previously undetected forms of hallucination.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:**\n        *   **Improved VLM Development:** The benchmark and its novel metrics offer a more robust diagnostic tool for identifying and understanding VLM weaknesses, thereby guiding the development of more reliable, trustworthy, and factually grounded multi-modal models \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n        *   **Deeper Hallucination Analysis:** It enables researchers to more effectively disentangle the sources of hallucination by directly observing how models react to explicit visual changes, fostering targeted research into mitigation strategies \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n        *   **New Research Directions:** The ability to visualize object relationships and the granular evaluation metrics can inspire new research avenues into how VLMs process multi-modal information, how internal knowledge biases their responses, and how to build models with true visual understanding \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n\n---",

        "title": "ClearSight: Visual Signal Enhancement for Object Hallucination Mitigation in Multimodal Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "Contrastive decoding strategies are widely used to mitigate object hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By reducing over-reliance on language priors, these strategies ensure that generated content remains closely grounded in visual inputs, producing contextually accurate outputs. Since contrastive decoding requires no additional training or external tools, it offers both computational efficiency and versatility, making it highly attractive. However, these methods present two main limitations: (1) bluntly suppressing language priors can compromise coherence and accuracy of generated content, and (2) processing contrastive inputs adds computational load, significantly slowing inference speed. To address these challenges, we propose Visual Amplification Fusion (VAF), a plug-and-play technique that enhances attention to visual signals within the model’s middle layers, where modality fusion predominantly occurs. This approach enables more effective capture of visual features, reducing the model’s bias toward language modality. Experimental results demonstrate that VAF significantly reduces hallucinations across various MLLMs without affecting inference speed, while maintaining coherence and accuracy in generated outputs. The code is available at https://github.com/ustc-hyin/ClearSight.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **1. Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently suffer from \"object hallucination,\" where generated textual descriptions do not accurately reflect objects present in the visual input \\cite{yin2025s2b}. This stems from an over-reliance on unimodal (especially language) priors during inference.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: Object hallucination poses significant risks in high-precision applications like medical diagnosis and autonomous driving. Existing mitigation strategies, particularly contrastive decoding, introduce their own challenges: they can compromise the coherence and accuracy of generated content and significantly increase inference time due to the need for processing additional contrastive inputs \\cite{yin2025s2b}.\n\n*   **2. Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: The paper positions itself against existing Contrastive Decoding strategies (e.g., Visual Contrastive Decoding - VCD, Instruction Contrastive Decoding - ICD) which aim to reduce hallucination by contrasting output distributions from original and perturbed inputs \\cite{yin2025s2b}. These methods are attractive due to being training-free and versatile.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: While effective in reducing reliance on language priors, contrastive decoding methods have two main drawbacks:\n        1.  They can degrade the quality, coherence, and accuracy of generated content, especially in complex tasks requiring nuanced natural language generation (e.g., a 19% decrease on NoCaps and 5% on ScienceQA for VCD) \\cite{yin2025s2b}.\n        2.  They considerably increase inference time (nearly doubling it for VCD) because they require separate processing of original and contrastive inputs \\cite{yin2025s2b}.\n\n*   **3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes Visual Amplification Fusion (VAF), a plug-and-play technique designed to mitigate object hallucinations \\cite{yin2025s2b}.

Saliency analysis was performed to understand visual information flow and attention distribution across modalities \\cite{yin2025s2b}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   **Hallucination Mitigation**: VAF \\cite{yin2025s2b} demonstrated notable performance gains, with approximately 3% improvement on the POPE benchmark and 7% on MME.\n        *   **Content Coherence and Accuracy**: While VCD caused a significant decrease (e.g., ~19% on NoCaps and 5% on ScienceQA), VAF \\cite{yin2025s2b} maintained content quality without negative impacts.\n        *   **Inference Speed**: VCD reduced inference speed by 50% (nearly doubling inference time), whereas VAF \\cite{yin2025s2b} had virtually no effect on inference speed.\n\n*   **6. Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The paper primarily focuses on addressing the limitations of *contrastive decoding* methods. It does not explicitly state technical limitations of VAF \\cite{yin2025s2b} itself, but rather presents it as a superior alternative.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: VAF \\cite{yin2025s2b} is a plug-and-play technique applicable to various MLLMs and is designed for training-free hallucination mitigation.\n\n*   **7. Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: ClearSight, with its VAF method, significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing a training-free, plug-and-play solution that effectively mitigates object hallucination in MLLMs without compromising content quality or inference speed \\cite{yin2025s2b}. This overcomes critical drawbacks of widely used contrastive decoding strategies.\n    *   **Potential Impact**: The method's ability to maintain content coherence and inference speed while reducing hallucinations makes MLLMs more reliable and efficient for real-world, high-precision applications.

Most existing LVLM hallucination benchmarks are constrained to evaluate the object-related hallucinations. However, the potential hallucination on the relations between two objects, i.e., relation hallucination, still lacks investigation. To remedy that, we design a unified framework to measure the object and relation hallucination in LVLMs simultaneously. The core idea of our framework is to evaluate hallucinations via (object, relation, object) triplets extracted from LVLMs'responses, making it easily generalizable to different vision-language tasks. Based on our framework, we further introduce Tri-HE, a novel Triplet-level Hallucination Evaluation benchmark which can be used to study both object and relation hallucination at the same time. With comprehensive evaluations on Tri-HE, we observe that the relation hallucination issue is even more serious than object hallucination among existing LVLMs, highlighting a previously neglected problem towards reliable LVLMs. Moreover, based on our findings, we design a simple training-free approach that effectively mitigates hallucinations for LVLMs. Our dataset and code for the reproduction of our experiments are available publicly at https://github.com/wujunjie1998/Tri-HE.",

        "abstract": "Object hallucination has been an Achilles' heel which hinders the broader applications of large vision-language models (LVLMs). Object hallucination refers to the phenomenon that the LVLMs claim non-existent objects in the image. To mitigate the object hallucinations, instruction tuning and external model-based detection methods have been proposed, which either require large-scare computational resources or depend on the detection result of external models. However, there remains an under-explored field to utilize the LVLM itself to alleviate object hallucinations. In this work, we adopt the intuition that the LVLM tends to respond logically consistently for existent objects but inconsistently for hallucinated objects. Therefore, we propose a Logical Closed Loop-based framework for Object Hallucination Detection and Mitigation, namely LogicCheckGPT. In specific, we devise logical consistency probing to raise questions with logical correlations, inquiring about attributes from objects and vice versa. Whether their responses can form a logical closed loop serves as an indicator of object hallucination.

Current mitigation strategies are often computationally expensive (instruction tuning), rely on external models, or require access to the LVLM's internal parameters, leaving a gap for methods that leverage the LVLM's inherent capabilities for self-correction \\cite{wu2024h81}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Previous efforts to mitigate LVLM hallucinations include instruction tuning/retraining, integrating external detection models, and devising novel decoding strategies \\cite{wu2024h81}. The paper also distinguishes itself from consistency-checking methods in Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g., SelfCheckGPT), which typically assess consistency among responses to the *same* question \\cite{wu2024h81}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Instruction tuning demands substantial computational resources and high-quality data. External model-based approaches introduce dependencies and do not explore the base LVLM's intrinsic reasoning. Decoding strategies often require privileged access to internal model states.

It operates on the principle that LVLMs exhibit logical consistency when discussing existent objects but inconsistency for hallucinated ones. The framework comprises five steps:\n        1.  **Object Extraction**: An auxiliary LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5) extracts candidate objects from the LVLM's initial image description \\cite{wu2024h81}.\n        2.  **Object-to-Attribute Inquiring**: The LVLM is prompted to provide detailed attributes for each extracted object \\cite{wu2024h81}.\n        3.  **Attribute-to-Object Inquiring**: An LLM first extracts specific attributes from the descriptions, then formulates follow-up questions (e.g., \"Could you tell me all the objects that {attribute} in the image?\") to query which objects possess these attributes \\cite{wu2024h81}.\n        4.  **Logical Closed Loop Checking**: An LLM verifies if the object identified in the attribute-to-object response is consistent with the original examinee object, thus forming a \"logical closed loop\" \\cite{wu2024h81}.\n        5.  **Hallucination Detection and Mitigation**: A \"logical closed loop rate\" is calculated for each object. Objects with a rate below a predefined threshold are flagged as hallucinated, and the LVLM's original response is then rectified by removing content related to these objects \\cite{wu2024h81}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**: `LogicCheckGPT` is novel as it is the first to employ the \"logical closed loop\" concept for object hallucination alleviation in LVLMs \\cite{wu2024h81}. It is a training-free, plug-and-play method that relies solely on language interactions, avoiding the need for external models or internal parameter access, thereby leveraging the LVLM's inherent capabilities \\cite{wu2024h81}. The specific prompt design for attribute-to-object inquiring (asking for \"all objects\") is also a key innovation to ensure comprehensive coverage \\cite{wu2024h81}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**: Introduction of the \"logical closed loop\" as a novel metric and probing mechanism for object hallucination in LVLMs \\cite{wu2024h81}. Development of the `LogicCheckGPT` framework, which systematically uses a sequence of logically correlated questions to assess and correct LVLM outputs \\cite{wu2024h81}.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: A plug-and-play, training-free framework that seamlessly integrates with existing LVLMs, requiring no architectural modifications or retraining \\cite{wu2024h81}. The strategic use of an auxiliary LLM for sub-tasks like object and attribute extraction, and logical checking, enhances flexibility and robustness \\cite{wu2024h81}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: The core insight that the logical consistency of an LVLM's responses to related inquiries can serve as a reliable indicator of object hallucination \\cite{wu2024h81}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Comprehensive experiments were performed across three benchmarks, including the POPE dataset (with random, popular, and adversarial settings), and evaluated on four advanced LVLMs \\cite{wu2024h81}. GPT-4v assisted evaluation was also utilized \\cite{wu2024h81}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**: `LogicCheckGPT` demonstrated significant improvements in mitigating object hallucinations. For example, it achieved a 31.33% improvement for mPLUG-Owl and a 10.00% improvement for MiniGPT-4 on the POPE dataset, showcasing its effectiveness and generality across state-of-the-art LVLMs \\cite{wu2024h81}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The method's performance is partly dependent on the capabilities of the auxiliary LLM used for sub-tasks. The effectiveness of hallucination detection relies on a properly tuned \"hallucination threshold\" (λ) \\cite{wu2024h81}. The approach assumes that LVLMs will exhibit differential logical consistency, which might not hold universally for all types of hallucinations or models \\cite{wu2024h81}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: `LogicCheckGPT` is designed as a plug-and-play solution, making it broadly applicable to any existing LVLM that can engage in language-based question-answering, without requiring model-specific training or internal access \\cite{wu2024h81}. Its primary focus is on detecting and mitigating object hallucinations in multimodal contexts \\cite{wu2024h81}.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: `LogicCheckGPT` significantly advances the state-of-the-art by providing a novel, training-free, and interpretable method for object hallucination mitigation that leverages the intrinsic reasoning capabilities of LVLMs themselves \\cite{wu2024h81}. It addresses key limitations of prior methods by avoiding high computational costs, external dependencies, and the need for internal model access \\cite{wu2024h81}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: This work opens new avenues for research into self-correction, intrinsic reasoning, and language-based introspection within LVLMs and other large AI models \\cite{wu2024h81}.

To address this issue, previous works focused on using specially curated datasets or powerful LLMs to rectify the outputs of LVLMs. However, these approaches require either costly training or fine-tuning, or API access to proprietary LLMs for post-generation correction. In response to these limitations, we propose Mitigating hallucinAtion via image-gRounded guIdaNcE (MARINE), a framework that is both training-free and API-free. MARINE effectively and efficiently reduces object hallucinations during inference by introducing image-grounded guidance to LVLMs. This is achieved by leveraging open-source vision models to extract object-level information, thereby enhancing the precision of LVLM-generated content. Our framework's flexibility further allows for the integration of multiple vision models, enabling more reliable and robust object-level guidance. Through comprehensive evaluations across 5 popular LVLMs with diverse evaluation metrics and benchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MARINE, which even outperforms existing fine-tuning-based methods. Remarkably, it reduces hallucinations consistently in GPT-4V-assisted evaluation while maintaining the detailedness of LVLMs' generations.

It operates in two main steps:\n        1.  **Visual Guidance from Image-Grounded Features**: Leverages open-source, specialized vision models (e.g., object detection models like DETR and RAM++) to extract detailed, object-level visual information from the input image. This information is aggregated (potentially by a small language model or rule-based algorithm) and translated into a textual \"guidance prompt\" (e.g., \"focusing on the visible objects in this image: [aggregated object info]\").\n        2.  **Guided Text Generation**: Integrates this guidance prompt (`c`) into the LVLM's generation process using a classifier-free guidance mechanism in the logit space. The output token `yt` is sampled from a linearly combined logit space: `log p_guided(yt) = γ * log p_conditional(yt) + (1 - γ) * log p_unconditional(yt)`. Here, `p_conditional` is the generation conditioned on the original visual tokens, textual prompt, *and* the guidance prompt `c`, while `p_unconditional` is conditioned only on the original visual tokens and textual prompt.\n    *   **Novelty & Differentiation**:\n        *   **Training-Free & API-Free**: Unlike most prior work, MARINE requires no additional training or fine-tuning of the LVLM and no access to proprietary LLM APIs.\n        *   **Addresses Intrinsic Causes**: Directly tackles hallucination arising from insufficient visual context and information distortion by enriching the visual input with fine-grained, externally derived object information.\n        *   **Flexible Integration**: Allows for the integration and aggregation of multiple open-source vision models, enhancing robustness and reliability.\n        *   **Inference-Time Control**: Applies guidance directly during the decoding process, offering real-time control over generation.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Framework (MARINE)**: A universal, training-free, and API-free framework for mitigating object hallucination in LVLMs.\n    *   **Image-Grounded Guidance Mechanism**: Introduces a method to leverage external, specialized vision models to provide detailed object-level information, which is then converted into textual guidance.\n    *   **Logit-Space Guidance for LVLMs**: Adapts classifier-free guidance to the multi-modal context of LVLMs, allowing for controllable generation by balancing original LVLM output with image-grounded guidance.\n    *   **Aggregation of Multiple Vision Models**: Demonstrates the ability to aggregate information from diverse vision models (e.g., DETR, RAM++) for more robust guidance.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Comprehensive evaluations were performed across 5 popular LVLMs (LLaVA, LLaVA-v1.5, MiniGPT-v2, mPLUG-Owl2, InstructBLIP) using guidance from DETR and RAM++.\n    *   **Benchmarks & Metrics**:\n        *   **Image Captioning**: CHAIR-I (instance-level hallucination), CHAIR-S (sentence-level hallucination), and Recall (inclusion of existing objects) on MSCOCO.\n        *   **Visual Question Answering (VQA)**: POPE (Polling-based Object Probing Evaluation) in adversarial settings (accuracy, F1, \"yes\" answer proportion) on LLaVA-QA90, A-OKVQA, and GQA.\n        *   **Qualitative Evaluation**: GPT-4V-aided evaluation for overall quality and hallucination assessment.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results**:\n        *   **Hallucination Reduction**: MARINE consistently and significantly reduces object hallucinations across all evaluated LVLMs and benchmarks, as measured by CHAIR-I, CHAIR-S, and POPE.\n        *   **Outperforms Baselines**: Achieves superior hallucination mitigation compared to state-of-the-art methods, including existing fine-tuning-based approaches.\n        *   **Maintains Detailedness**: While reducing hallucination, MARINE effectively maintains the detailedness and overall performance of LVLMs' generations (e.g., high Recall scores).\n        *   **Efficiency**: Provides a favorable trade-off between latency and accuracy, demonstrating the lowest computational overhead compared to existing baselines, making it a practical and scalable solution.\n        *   **GPT-4V Evaluation**: Consistently reduces hallucinations in GPT-4V-assisted evaluations.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**: While addressing visual encoder and cross-modal projection issues, MARINE does not directly tackle \"inherent hallucinations common in general language models\" (i.e., language-prior-driven hallucinations).

        "abstract": "Though advanced in understanding visual information with human languages, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) still suffer from multimodal hallucinations. A natural concern is that during multimodal interaction, the generated hallucinations could influence the LVLMs' subsequent generation. Thus, we raise a question: When presented with a query relevant to the previously generated hallucination, will LVLMs be misled and respond incorrectly, even though the ground visual information exists? To answer this, we propose a framework called MMHalSnowball to evaluate LVLMs' behaviors when encountering generated hallucinations, where LVLMs are required to answer specific visual questions within a curated hallucinatory conversation. Crucially, our experiment shows that the performance of open-source LVLMs drops by at least $31\\%$, indicating that LVLMs are prone to accept the generated hallucinations and make false claims that they would not have supported without distractions. We term this phenomenon Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing. To mitigate this, we further propose a training-free method called Residual Visual Decoding, where we revise the output distribution of LVLMs with the one derived from the residual visual input, providing models with direct access to the visual information. Experiments show that our method can mitigate more than $24\\%$ of the snowballed multimodal hallucination while maintaining capabilities.",

Despite these advances, LVLMs still face challenges with multimodal hallucination, such as generating text descriptions of objects that are not present in the visual information. However, the underlying fundamental reasons of multimodal hallucinations remain poorly explored. In this paper, we propose a new perspective, suggesting that the inherent biases in LVLMs might be a key factor in hallucinations. Specifically, we systematically identify a semantic shift bias related to paragraph breaks (\\n\\n), where the content before and after '\\n\\n' in the training data frequently exhibit significant semantic changes. This pattern leads the model to infer that the contents following '\\n\\n' should be obviously different from the preceding contents with less hallucinatory descriptions, thereby increasing the probability of hallucinatory descriptions subsequent to the '\\n\\n'. We have validated this hypothesis on multiple publicly available LVLMs. Besides, we find that deliberately inserting '\\n\\n' at the generated description can induce more hallucinations. A simple method is proposed to effectively mitigate the hallucination of LVLMs by skipping the output of '\\n'.",

Related Work & Positioning**\n\n*   **Relation to Existing Approaches:**\n    *   Existing hallucination mitigation methods are broadly categorized into retraining-based (e.g., redesigning vision encoders, finetuning with high-quality data, reinforcement learning) and post-hoc processing-based (e.g., decoding strategies, reviser models).\n    *   Previous studies have attributed hallucinations to imperfections in vision encoders or inherent model uncertainties.\n*   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n    *   Many existing approaches lack an exploration of the fundamental factors causing LVLM hallucinations.\n    *   Retraining-based methods often incur significant additional computational overhead.\n    *   \\cite{han202439z} distinguishes itself by investigating hallucinations from the perspective of inherent biases within the models, offering a novel angle.\n\n### **3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n\n*   **Core Technical Method/Algorithm:**\n    *   The paper proposes that an inherent \"semantic shift bias\" related to paragraph breaks ('\\n\\n') in training data is a key factor in LVLM hallucinations.\n    *   This bias causes models to infer that content following '\\n\\n' should be semantically different from preceding content, increasing the likelihood of hallucinatory descriptions.\n    *   To mitigate this, two orthogonal methods are proposed to prevent the generation of '\\n\\n':\n        *   **Mitigating Hallucinations during Input (MiHI):** Modifying the input prompt to encourage single-paragraph generation (e.g., adding \"in one paragraph\" to the instruction).\n        *   **Mitigating Hallucinations during Output (MiHO):** Adjusting the decoding strategy by reducing the logits (prediction probability) of the '\\n' token, effectively preventing its generation (by setting a penalty strength λ to positive infinity).\n*   **Novelty/Difference:**\n    *   Identifies and systematically validates a previously unexplored \"semantic shift bias\" linked to paragraph breaks as a root cause of hallucination.\n    *   Introduces simple, efficient, and cost-effective post-hoc methods (prompt engineering and logit manipulation) that do not require model retraining or additional complex architectures.\n    *   Demonstrates that deliberately inserting '\\n\\n' can *induce* hallucinations, further supporting the hypothesis and providing a novel attack mechanism.\n\n### **4. Key Technical Contributions**\n\n*   **Novel Algorithms, Methods, or Techniques:**\n    *   Identification and empirical validation of the \"semantic shift bias\" in LVLMs, where '\\n\\n' tokens trigger increased hallucination rates.\n    *   A method to induce multimodal hallucinations by strategically inserting '\\n\\n' tokens.\n    *   **MiHI:** A prompt engineering technique to reduce hallucinations by encouraging single-paragraph outputs.\n    *   **MiHO:** A decoding strategy modification that suppresses the generation of '\\n' tokens by manipulating output logits.\n*   **Theoretical Insights or Analysis:**\n    *   Hypothesizes that the frequent semantic changes observed around '\\n\\n' in training data lead LVLMs to associate '\\n\\n' with a shift towards potentially less grounded or more divergent content, increasing hallucination probability.\n\n### **5. Experimental Validation**\n\n*   **Experiments Conducted:**\n    *   **Hypothesis Verification (Q1):** Compared hallucination severity in text generated *before* vs. *after* a '\\n' token.\n    *   **Attackability (Q2):** Tested if manually inserting '\\n\\n' at different positions in generated text induces more hallucinations.\n    *   **Effectiveness (Q3):** Evaluated MiHO, MiHI, and their combination against original LVLM outputs.\n    *   **Effectiveness (Q3, Equal Length):** Conducted comparisons at equal output lengths to control for sentence length effects.\n*   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results:**\n    *   **Metrics:** Cs (ratio of hallucinated objects to all mentioned objects) and Ci (ratio of captions with hallucinated objects to all captions). Lower values indicate less hallucination.\n    *   **Models:** Evaluated on six publicly available LVLMs: BakLLaVA, LLaVA-v1.5-7B, LLaVA-v1.5-13B, InstructBLIP-7B, MiniGPT-v2, and Fuyu-8B.\n    *   **Q1 Results:** Content generated *after* '\\n' consistently exhibited significantly higher Cs and Ci across all models and decoding strategies (e.g., for BakLLaVA with greedy decoding, Cs increased from 18.14% before '\\n' to 53.42% after '\\n').\n    *   **Q2 Results:** Inserting '\\n\\n' generally increased hallucination metrics (Cs and Ci), with later insertions often leading to more severe hallucinations (e.g., BakLLaVA with greedy decoding, original Cs=48.56%, Attack-3 Cs=54.54%).\n    *   **Q3 Results (Overall):** MiHO and MiHO+MiHI significantly reduced hallucinations across almost all models. MiHI was also effective but showed less improvement for Fuyu-8B, possibly due to its instruction-tuning limitations.\n    *   **Q3 Results (Equal Length):** MiHO consistently showed significant improvements. MiHI and MiHO+MiHI sometimes exhibited performance decreases, suggesting that modified prompts might negatively impact description quality when forced to equal lengths.\n    *   **Decoding Strategy:** Sampling decoding was found to be more prone to hallucinations than greedy decoding, and the proposed methods performed better with greedy decoding.\n\n### **6. Limitations & Scope**\n\n*   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:**\n    *   The '\\n\\n'-induced hallucination problem is not universal across all LVLMs (e.g., not observed in GPT-4).\n    *   The effectiveness of MiHI can depend on the LVLM's instruction-following capabilities (e.g., less effective for Fuyu-8B).\n    *   Forcing single-paragraph output via MiHI might, in some cases, negatively impact the overall quality or detail of descriptions when controlling for length.\n*   **Scope of Applicability:**\n    *   Primarily focuses on object hallucination in LVLMs.\n    *   The proposed methods are simple, post-hoc interventions applicable to LVLMs exhibiting the identified semantic shift bias, without requiring retraining.\n    *   The paper acknowledges that whether this bias persists or can be overcome with continued model scaling remains an open question.\n\n### **7. Technical Significance**\n\n*   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:**\n    *   Provides a novel, fundamental insight into a previously underexplored cause of multimodal hallucinations in LVLMs, linking it to inherent biases from training data patterns.\n    *   Offers highly efficient and cost-effective mitigation strategies that can be applied without modifying model architectures or retraining.\n    *   Introduces a new \"attack\" method that can be used to probe and evaluate LVLM robustness against hallucination.\n*   **Potential Impact on Future Research:**\n    *   Encourages deeper investigation into inherent biases within foundation models as a source of undesirable behaviors.\n    *   Suggests new avenues for designing more robust LVLMs by considering subtle training data patterns and refining decoding strategies.\n    *   Highlights the critical role of prompt engineering and decoding-time interventions in controlling model outputs and improving reliability.\n    *   Poses important questions about the relationship between model scale, training data biases, and hallucination phenomena.",

        "title": "Mitigating Modality Prior-Induced Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models via Deciphering Attention Causality",
        "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a central focus in both industry and academia, but often suffer from biases introduced by visual and language priors, which can lead to multimodal hallucination. These biases arise from the visual encoder and the Large Language Model (LLM) backbone, affecting the attention mechanism responsible for aligning multimodal inputs. Existing decoding-based mitigation methods focus on statistical correlations and overlook the causal relationships between attention mechanisms and model output, limiting their effectiveness in addressing these biases. To tackle this issue, we propose a causal inference framework termed CausalMM that applies structural causal modeling to MLLMs, treating modality priors as a confounder between attention mechanisms and output. Specifically, by employing backdoor adjustment and counterfactual reasoning at both the visual and language attention levels, our method mitigates the negative effects of modality priors and enhances the alignment of MLLM's inputs and outputs, with a maximum score improvement of 65.3% on 6 VLind-Bench indicators and 164 points on MME Benchmark compared to conventional methods.

For LLaVA-1.5, it significantly improved performance in the multimodal collaborative setting, indicating balanced priors. For Qwen2-VL, it improved visual priors, leading to optimal performance in language and multimodal settings.\n        *   **MME Benchmark:** Assesses perception and cognition.

The effectiveness relies on the chosen counterfactual attention states and the back-door adjustment principle.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The CAUSAL MM framework is a **plug-and-play, training-free solution** applicable to any MLLM, making it broadly usable for enhancing existing models.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** This work significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by introducing a principled **causal inference framework** for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs, moving beyond purely statistical approaches.

        "abstract": "Recently, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in multi-modal context comprehension. However, they still suffer from hallucination problems referring to generating inconsistent outputs with the image content. To mitigate hallucinations, previous studies mainly focus on retraining LVLMs with custom datasets. Although effective, they inherently come with additional computational costs. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework, \\textbf{MVP}, that aims to reduce hallucinations by making the most of the innate capabilities of the LVLMs via \\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{V}iew Multi-\\textbf{P}ath Reasoning. Specifically, we first devise a multi-view information-seeking strategy to thoroughly perceive the comprehensive information in the image, which enriches the general global information captured by the original vision encoder in LVLMs. Furthermore, during the answer decoding, we observe that the occurrence of hallucinations has a strong correlation with the certainty of the answer tokens. Thus, we propose multi-path reasoning for each information view to quantify and aggregate the certainty scores for each potential answer among multiple decoding paths and finally decide the output answer. By fully grasping the information in the image and carefully considering the certainty of the potential answers when decoding, our MVP can effectively reduce hallucinations in LVLMs.The extensive experiments verify that our proposed MVP significantly mitigates the hallucination problem across four well-known LVLMs. The source code is available at: \\url{https://github.com/GasolSun36/MVP}.",

Research Problem & Motivation**\n\n*   **Specific Technical Problem**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) frequently suffer from \"hallucination,\" where they generate text that is semantically plausible but factually inconsistent or inaccurate with the visual content of an image. This includes misidentifying objects, miscounting quantities, or describing non-existent elements.\n*   **Importance and Challenge**: Hallucinations undermine the trustworthiness and reliability of LVLMs, which are increasingly deployed in critical applications like healthcare, autonomous systems, and robotics. Addressing this issue is crucial to prevent erroneous decisions and ensure the safe and effective use of these models. The challenge lies in mitigating hallucinations without incurring significant computational costs or requiring extensive retraining.\n\n### **2. Related Work & Positioning**\n\n*   **Existing Approaches**:\n    *   **Retraining LVLMs**: Most prior work focuses on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) using custom hallucination-related datasets.\n    *   **Training-free Paradigms**: Some recent methods, like Woodpecker and MARINE, explore training-free approaches.\n*   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n    *   **Retraining**: Inherently comes with substantial computational costs, requires a large number of high-quality training examples, and is time-consuming and labor-intensive.\n    *   **Training-free (prior art)**: Often heavily rely on external, complicated tools (e.g., Grounding DINO, BLIP-2-FlanT5X), introducing additional dependencies and complexity.\n*   **Positioning of this Work**: \\cite{qu2024pqc} proposes a novel *training-free* framework, MVP, that *maximizes the innate capabilities of existing LVLMs* without introducing additional training costs or relying on external tools. It addresses hallucination by tackling two root causes: incomplete comprehension of image content and low certainty during answer token decoding.\n\n### **3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n\n*   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes MVP (Multi-View Multi-Path Reasoning), a training-free framework that enhances LVLM inference by:\n    1.  **Multi-View Information Seeking**: Devising a strategy to thoroughly perceive comprehensive image information from varying dimensions (\"top-down,\" \"regular,\" and \"bottom-up\" views). This information is generated by the LVLMs themselves using dedicated prompts, enriching the global visual context captured by the original vision encoder.\n    2.  **Multi-Path Certainty-Driven Reasoning**: During answer decoding, it observes that hallucinations correlate with low certainty of answer tokens. It quantifies the \"Certainty Score\" (difference between top-two token probabilities) for potential answers. It then generates multiple decoding paths (e.g., by considering top-K candidate first tokens) and aggregates the certainty scores for each potential answer across these paths and across different information views. The answer with the highest aggregated certainty score is selected as the final output.\n*   **Novelty/Differentiation**:\n    *   **Training-free and Tool-free**: Unlike retraining methods or other training-free approaches that use external tools, MVP leverages only the inherent capabilities of the target LVLM.\n    *   **Comprehensive Image Understanding**: Introduces a multi-view strategy to extract richer visual information directly from the LVLM, going beyond the single global representation.\n    *   **Certainty-Driven Decoding**: Explicitly quantifies and utilizes the certainty of answer tokens during decoding, guiding the model to more reliable outputs by exploring multiple reasoning paths.\n\n### **4. Key Technical Contributions**\n\n*   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**:\n    *   A multi-view information-seeking strategy that uses LVLM-generated captions from \"bottom-up,\" \"regular,\" and \"top-down\" perspectives to enrich image understanding without external tools.\n    *   A multi-path certainty-driven reasoning mechanism that quantifies answer certainty based on token probability differences and aggregates these scores across multiple decoding paths and information views.\n*   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: MVP is a plug-and-play framework that can be integrated with existing LVLMs and potentially other decoding methods, enhancing their performance without modifying their internal architecture or requiring retraining.\n*   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: Identifies and leverages the strong correlation between the occurrence of hallucinations and the low certainty of answer tokens during decoding, providing a principled way to mitigate them.\n\n### **5. Experimental Validation**\n\n*   **Experiments Conducted**: Extensive experiments were conducted on four state-of-the-art LVLMs (LLaVA-1.5, Qwen-VL, InstructBLIP, and mPLUG-Owl2, all with 7B LLM backbones).\n*   **Benchmarks**: Evaluated on two widely-used hallucination benchmarks:\n    *   **POPE (Polling-based Object Probing Evaluation)**: Assesses object presence/absence across random, popular, and adversarial settings, using data from MSCOCO, A-OKVQA, and GQA.\n    *   **MME (Multi-modal Model Evaluation)**: A comprehensive benchmark covering 10 perception-related and 4 cognition-focused subtasks, with specific focus on existence, count, position, and color subsets for object/attribute-level hallucination.\n*   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n    *   **POPE**: MVP significantly outperformed vanilla LVLMs and recent training-free baselines (VCD, OPERA) across all models and settings. For LLaVA-1.5, MVP achieved an average improvement of 15.9 in Accuracy and 21.84 in F1 score across random, popular, and adversarial settings on MSCOCO. Improvements were primarily driven by increased recall (LLaVA-1.5, Qwen-VL, InstructBLIP) or a balanced improvement in both precision and recall (mPLUG-Owl2).\n    *   **MME**: (Details not fully provided in the excerpt, but the abstract states \"extensive experiments verify that our proposed MVP significantly mitigates the hallucination problem across four well-known LVLMs.\")\n    *   **Visual Richness**: Statistical analysis showed that the multi-view information-seeking strategy significantly increased the number of objects recognized in captions (e.g., LLaVA-1.5 recognized 36.66 objects/image with multi-view vs. 16.43 with regular captioning).\n\n### **6. Limitations & Scope**\n\n*   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**:\n    *   The effectiveness relies on the LVLM's ability to generate meaningful multi-view captions and its internal probability distributions for certainty scoring.\n    *   The \"training-free\" nature means it doesn't fundamentally alter the LVLM's learned representations but rather optimizes its inference process.\n    *   Hyperparameters like `K` (number of paths) and `alpha_i` (view importance) need to be tuned.\n*   **Scope of Applicability**: MVP is designed for mitigating hallucinations in existing LVLMs during inference. It is applicable to various LVLMs and can be combined with other decoding methods.

        "abstract": "Despite the remarkable ability of large vision-language models (LVLMs) in image comprehension, these models frequently generate plausible yet factually incorrect responses, a phenomenon known as hallucination. Recently, in large language models (LLMs), augmenting LLMs by retrieving information from external knowledge resources has been proven as a promising solution to mitigate hallucinations. However, the retrieval augmentation in LVLM significantly lags behind the widespread applications of LVLM. Moreover, when transferred to augmenting LVLMs, sometimes the hallucination degree of the model is even exacerbated. Motivated by the research gap and counter-intuitive phenomenon, we introduce a novel framework, the Active Retrieval-Augmented large vision-language model (ARA), specifically designed to address hallucinations by incorporating three critical dimensions: (i) dissecting the retrieval targets based on the inherent hierarchical structures of images. (ii) pinpointing the most effective retrieval methods and filtering out the reliable retrieval results. (iii) timing the retrieval process to coincide with episodes of low certainty, while circumventing unnecessary retrieval during periods of high certainty. To assess the capability of our proposed ARA model in reducing hallucination, we employ three widely used LVLM models (LLaVA-1.5, Qwen-VL, and mPLUG-Owl2) across four benchmarks. Our empirical observations suggest that by utilizing fitting retrieval mechanisms and timing the retrieval judiciously, we can effectively mitigate the hallucination problem. We hope that this study can provide deeper insights into how to adapt the retrieval augmentation to LVLMs for reducing hallucinations with more effective retrieval and minimal retrieval occurrences.",

Yet, these models are often plagued by the hallucination problem, which involves generating inaccurate objects, attributes, and relationships that do not match the visual content. In this work, we delve into the internal attention mechanisms of MLLMs to reveal the underlying causes of hallucination, exposing the inherent vulnerabilities in the instruction-tuning process.

        "abstract": "While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, they suffer from hallucination problems, where models generate plausible yet incorrect answers given the input image-query pair. This hallucination phenomenon is even more severe when querying the image in non-English languages, while existing methods for mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs only consider the English scenarios. In this paper, we make the first attempt to mitigate this important multilingual hallucination in LVLMs. With thorough experiment analysis, we found that multilingual hallucination in LVLMs is a systemic problem that could arise from deficiencies in multilingual capabilities or inadequate multimodal abilities. To this end, we propose a two-stage Multilingual Hallucination Removal (MHR) framework for LVLMs, aiming to improve resistance to hallucination for both high-resource and low-resource languages. Instead of relying on the intricate manual annotations of multilingual resources, we fully leverage the inherent capabilities of the LVLM and propose a novel cross-lingual alignment method, which generates multiple responses for each image-query input and then identifies the hallucination-aware pairs for each language. These data pairs are finally used for direct preference optimization to prompt the LVLMs to favor non-hallucinating responses. Experimental results show that our MHR achieves a substantial reduction in hallucination generation for LVLMs. Notably, on our extended multilingual POPE benchmark, our framework delivers an average increase of 19.0% in accuracy across 13 different languages.

Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple hallucination evaluation datasets, surpassing most state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and highlighting the potential of our approach. Ablation studies and in-depth analyses further confirm the effectiveness of our method and suggest the potential for further improvements through scaling up.",
        "summary": "This paper introduces Hallucination-targeted Direct Preference Optimization (HDPO) to mitigate diverse forms of hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) \\cite{fu2024yqj}.\n\n### 1. Research Problem & Motivation\n\n*   **Specific Technical Problem**: MLLMs are prone to \"hallucinations,\" generating content that is unfaithful or misaligned with visual input \\cite{fu2024yqj}. This issue manifests in various forms, including insufficient visual understanding, errors in long-context generation, and conflicts between multimodal information \\cite{fu2024yqj}.\n*   **Importance and Challenge**: Hallucinations severely undermine the reliability and practicality of MLLMs, especially in critical applications like autonomous driving or medical tasks \\cite{fu2024yqj}. Existing methods often show inconsistent improvements across different hallucination types or fail to address the fundamental causes, making comprehensive mitigation challenging \\cite{fu2024yqj}.\n\n### 2. Related Work & Positioning\n\n*   **Relation to Existing Approaches**:\n    *   **Training-Free Methods (e.g., VCD, OPERA, WoodPecker)**: These methods (e.g., contrastive decoding, external visual models) are simple and training-free but do not fundamentally enhance the MLLM's intrinsic capabilities, often increasing inference load or complexity \\cite{fu2024yqj}.\n    *   **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) Methods (e.g., HA-DPO, SeVa, BPO)**: Pioneer DPO methods encourage learning from positive/negative sample comparisons to alleviate hallucinations \\cite{fu2024yqj}.\n*   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n    *   Training-free methods are superficial, not improving core model capabilities \\cite{fu2024yqj}.\n    *   Existing DPO methods show inconsistent improvements across different MLLM hallucination tasks (e.g., VQA vs. captioning) \\cite{fu2024yqj}.\n    *   Their effectiveness is often tied to the format of training data (e.g., SeVa performs well on VQA due to VQA-centric data but poorly on captioning) \\cite{fu2024yqj}.\n    *   Crucially, previous DPO methods do not explicitly consider or target the diverse underlying causes and forms of MLLM hallucinations \\cite{fu2024yqj}.\n\n### 3. Technical Approach & Innovation\n\n*   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes Hallucination-targeted Direct Preference Optimization (HDPO), which constructs specific preference pair data designed to address three identified causes of MLLM hallucinations \\cite{fu2024yqj}.\n*   **Novelty/Differentiation**: Unlike previous DPO approaches that use general preference data or suboptimal negative examples, HDPO explicitly targets hallucinations from their diverse forms and causes through novel data construction strategies \\cite{fu2024yqj}.\n    *   **Visual Distracted Hallucination (VDH)**: Negative samples are generated by preserving only visual tokens with the lowest attention scores during autoregressive decoding, amplifying the influence of irrelevant visual information to train the model to focus on more important visual cues \\cite{fu2024yqj}.\n    *   **Long Context Hallucination (LCH)**: Positive examples are high-quality long-form captions. Negative examples are created by truncating the end of a positive example and having the MLLM continue generation from the prefix, often leading to content deviation from the image. A \"hint phrase\" and modified system prompt are used to encourage longer, error-prone generations \\cite{fu2024yqj}.\n    *   **Multimodal Conflict Hallucination (MCH)**: Negative examples are generated by prompting the MLLM with questions containing conflicting information (rewritten by GPT-4o-mini) at the beginning of the prompt, which often leads the model to hallucinate based on the text rather than the image \\cite{fu2024yqj}. The model is then trained to correctly respond despite these conflicting prefixes \\cite{fu2024yqj}.\n\n### 4. Key Technical Contributions\n\n*   **Novel Analysis of Hallucination Causes**: Identification and analysis of three distinct, key causes of MLLM hallucinations: insufficient visual capability, incapable long-context generation, and multimodal conflicts \\cite{fu2024yqj}.\n*   **Hallucination-targeted DPO Framework (HDPO)**: A novel DPO framework that jointly addresses multiple types of MLLM hallucinations by explicitly designing preference data for each identified cause \\cite{fu2024yqj}.\n*   **Innovative DPO Data Construction Strategies**: Development of three specific methods for generating positive/negative preference pairs (VDH, LCH, MCH) that directly target and simulate different hallucination types, guiding the model to learn robust alignment \\cite{fu2024yqj}.\n\n### 5. Experimental Validation\n\n*   **Experiments Conducted**: Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate HDPO across various types of MLLM hallucination tasks \\cite{fu2024yqj}. Ablation studies and in-depth analyses were also performed \\cite{fu2024yqj}.\n*   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n    *   The abstract states that HDPO achieves \"superior performance across multiple hallucination evaluation datasets\" \\cite{fu2024yqj}.\n    *   It \"surpasses most state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods\" \\cite{fu2024yqj}.\n    *   The method demonstrates \"consistent improvements in all types of M-hallu tasks\" \\cite{fu2024yqj}.\n    *   Ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of the method and suggested potential for further improvements through scaling up \\cite{fu2024yqj}.\n    *   (Specific datasets and quantitative results are not provided in the excerpt, but the abstract and introduction strongly indicate comprehensive evaluation.)\n\n### 6. Limitations & Scope\n\n*   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The paper does not explicitly state technical limitations within the provided excerpt. However, the reliance on GPT-4o-mini for generating conflicting information in MCH implies a dependency on external LLMs for data creation \\cite{fu2024yqj}. The effectiveness of the \"hint phrase\" and system prompt for LCH also suggests a degree of prompt engineering \\cite{fu2024yqj}.\n*   **Scope of Applicability**: HDPO is designed for general MLLMs and aims to mitigate hallucinations in both discriminative tasks (e.g., VQA) and generative tasks (e.g., image captioning) \\cite{fu2024yqj}. The approach is broadly applicable to MLLMs that utilize DPO for fine-tuning.\n\n### 7. Technical Significance\n\n*   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: HDPO advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing a more targeted and comprehensive approach to MLLM hallucination mitigation compared to previous DPO methods \\cite{fu2024yqj}. By addressing the root causes and diverse forms of hallucinations, it achieves more consistent and superior performance across various tasks \\cite{fu2024yqj}.\n*   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: The detailed analysis of hallucination causes and the novel data construction strategies offer valuable insights for future research in MLLM alignment and safety \\cite{fu2024yqj}. It highlights the importance of designing preference optimization data that specifically targets known failure modes, potentially leading to more robust and reliable multimodal AI systems \\cite{fu2024yqj}. The suggestion for further improvements through scaling up also points to future research directions \\cite{fu2024yqj}.",

        "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing attention in the past few years, but they may still generate descriptions that include objects not present in the corresponding images, a phenomenon known as object hallucination. To eliminate hallucinations, existing methods manually annotate paired responses with and without hallucinations, and then employ various alignment algorithms to improve the alignment capability between images and text. However, they not only demand considerable computation resources during the finetuning stage but also require expensive human annotation to construct paired data needed by the alignment algorithms. To address these issues, we propose an efficient fine-grained unlearning framework (EFUF), which performs gradient ascent utilizing three tailored losses to eliminate hallucinations without paired data. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently reduces hallucinations while preserving the generation quality with modest computational overhead. Our code and datasets will be publicly available.",

To address these challenges, we introduce Reefknot, a comprehensive benchmark targeting relation hallucinations, comprising over 20,000 real-world samples.

    "layer2_summary": "*Evolution Analysis:*\n\nThe trajectory of research into \"Hallucination in Large Language Models\" as traced through these four papers reveals two significant, interconnected trends: a **methodological shift from prevention through extensive training to more efficient, post-hoc, and decoding-time interventions**, and a **deepening conceptual understanding and formalization of hallucination itself**.\n\n### Trend 1: Methodological Shift Towards Efficient, Post-Generative Interventions\n\nInitially, the focus for mitigating hallucinations in multimodal models was heavily placed on robust training strategies. The paper \"[liu2023882] Mitigating Hallucination in Large Multi-Modal Models via Robust Instruction Tuning (2023)\" exemplifies this approach. It addresses the problem of Large Multi-Modal Models (LMMs) generating content inconsistent with visual input or instructions by proposing a *preventative* measure: instruction tuning with a novel dataset, LRV-Instruction. This dataset uniquely incorporates *negative instructions* at various semantic levels, explicitly training LMMs to identify and avoid describing nonexistent objects or inconsistent attributes. The key innovation here was the systematic inclusion of negative examples during the training phase, alongside a GPT4-assisted evaluation method (GAVIE) to assess both relevancy and accuracy. This method, while effective, is inherently data-intensive and requires retraining or fine-tuning models.\n\nRecognizing the computational and data-intensive nature of such training-based prevention, the field quickly explored more flexible and efficient alternatives. \"[yin2023hx3] Woodpecker: Hallucination Correction for Multimodal Large Language Models (2023)\" introduces a significant methodological shift by proposing a *post-remedy, training-free correction framework*. Woodpecker addresses the limitation that instruction-tuning can be costly and sometimes sacrifices detail or generative efficiency. Its core innovation is a five-stage pipeline that leverages external \"expert models\" (like object detectors and VQA models) to validate facts *after* an MLLM has generated its initial response. This allows for hallucination correction without altering the MLLM's internal weights, offering a plug-and-play solution with high interpretability due to explicit visual grounding (bounding boxes). This marks a transition from *preventing* hallucinations during generation to *correcting* them post-generation.\n\nFurther refining the efficiency and intervention point, \"[leng2023ohr] Mitigating Object Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models through Visual Contrastive Decoding (2023)\" introduces a *decoding-time, training-free mitigation strategy*. This paper tackles object hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), attributing them to over-reliance on statistical biases and unimodal language priors. Its innovation, Visual Contrastive Decoding (VCD), operates during the token generation process. By contrasting output distributions from original and subtly distorted visual inputs, VCD penalizes tokens that are highly probable under conditions where language priors are amplified, thereby calibrating the model's output. This approach is more integrated into the generation process than Woodpecker's post-hoc correction but avoids the extensive training required by instruction tuning. It represents a sophisticated, real-time intervention that doesn't require model retraining or external fact-checking after the full response is generated.\n\n### Trend 2: Deepening Conceptual Understanding and Formalization of Hallucination\n\nParallel to the evolution of mitigation strategies, there has been a growing sophistication in understanding and categorizing the phenomenon of hallucination itself. Initially, \"[liu2023882] Mitigating Hallucination in Large Multi-Modal Models via Robust Instruction Tuning (2023)\" identifies hallucination in LMMs as descriptions inconsistent with images or instructions, including nonexistent objects, inconsistent attributes, and knowledge manipulation. This paper provides empirical evidence of these types of hallucinations and proposes a dataset to specifically target them.\n\n\"[leng2023ohr] Mitigating Object Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models through Visual Contrastive Decoding (2023)\" delves deeper into the *causes* of hallucination, specifically object hallucinations. It empirically demonstrates that visual uncertainty amplifies LVLMs' reliance on statistical biases from training data and unimodal (language) priors. This insight is crucial as it moves beyond merely observing hallucinations to understanding their underlying cognitive mechanisms within the model, directly informing the design of VCD.\n\nThe culmination of this trend is seen in \"[huang2023akj] A Survey on Hallucination in Large Language Models: Principles, Taxonomy, Challenges, and Open Questions (2023)\". While a survey, it provides a crucial intellectual framework that synthesizes the evolving understanding. It proposes a novel, LLM-specific taxonomy, distinguishing between \"factuality hallucination\" (discrepancy with real-world facts) and \"faithfulness hallucination\" (divergence from user input/context or lack of self-consistency). Crucially, it categorizes the multifaceted causes of hallucination (data, training, inference-related factors) and systematically aligns mitigation strategies with these causes. This paper contextualizes the specific problems and solutions presented in the preceding works, providing a comprehensive map of the hallucination landscape and highlighting future directions, including the challenges in multimodal LLMs.\n\n*Synthesis:*\nThese works collectively illustrate a rapid and dynamic intellectual trajectory in addressing hallucination, moving from costly, training-based prevention to increasingly efficient, real-time, and post-generative interventions. Simultaneously, the field has deepened its understanding of hallucination, evolving from empirical observation to a formalized taxonomy and a cause-aligned framework, thereby advancing the reliability and trustworthiness of both unimodal and multimodal large language models."

Crucially, several new survey papers (`[pan2024y3a]`, `[li2025qzg]`, `[tonmoy20244e4]`) consolidate and expand the taxonomies and understanding of hallucination causes and mitigation strategies, updating and superseding earlier surveys like `[pan2023mwu]`, `[zhang2023k1j]`, and `[ye2023yom]`. The introduction of adversarial attacks (`[wang2025jen]`) provides a new lens for mechanistic understanding by actively probing vulnerabilities.\n\n*   **New Methodological or Conceptual Shifts:**\n    *   **Multimodal Hallucination as a Distinct Problem Space:** The most significant new conceptual shift is the dedicated focus on **hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), and Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs)**. This is not merely an extension but a new problem domain, recognizing that cross-modal inconsistencies introduce unique challenges and require modality-specific evaluation and mitigation. This forms a new major trend.\n    *   **Fine-Grained, Rationale-Level, and Long-Context Evaluation:** There's a clear shift towards more sophisticated and automated benchmarking. This includes fine-grained, sentence-level annotation (`[ji20243j6] ANAH`, `[gu202414e] ANAH-v2`), evaluation of LLM rationales (`[oh2024xa3] ERBench`), long-context hallucination assessment (`[qiu2024zyc] LongHalQA`), and domain-specific complex reasoning (`[tang2024a1j] GraphArena`). The goal is to move beyond simple \"yes/no\" or overall response judgments to understand *where*, *why*, and *how* hallucinations occur.\n    *   **\"Judge-Free\" and Efficient Self-Improvement:** New methods emphasize reducing computational overhead and reliance on large, potentially biased LLM judges for self-correction (`[deng202405j]`).\n    *   **Hallucination Visualization and Induced Optimization:** Novel approaches like using Text-to-Image (T2I) models for hallucination visualization (`[park20247cm]`) or intentionally \"inducing\" hallucinations in an \"Evil LVLM\" for contrastive decoding (`[chen20247jb]`) represent creative, mechanistic interventions.\n\n*   **Gaps Filled and New Directions Opened:**\n    *   **Gaps Filled:** The new papers fill critical gaps in multimodal hallucination evaluation and mitigation, which were largely absent in the previous synthesis (except for `[huang2023du3] OPERA`). They also address the lack of scalable, fine-grained annotation datasets and benchmarks for complex reasoning. The updated surveys consolidate a rapidly expanding field, providing much-needed structure.\n    *   **New Directions Opened:**\n        *   **Adversarial Hallucination Attacks:** `[wang2025jen]` opens the direction of actively attacking MLLMs to induce hallucinations, providing a new method for understanding vulnerabilities.\n        *   **Safety-Critical AI:** `[hakim2024d4u]` highlights the specific needs for \"semantic guardrails\" in high-stakes domains, pushing research towards application-specific reliability.\n        *   **Information Quality as a Holistic Metric:** `[rejeleene2024okw]` proposes a new conceptual framework for evaluating overall information quality, moving beyond just hallucination.\n        *   **Audio-Language Hallucination:** `[kuan20249pm]` introduces a completely new modality for hallucination research (LALMs).\n\n*   **Connections Between New and Earlier Works:**\n    *   `[ji20243j6] ANAH` and `[gu202414e] ANAH-v2` directly build on the need for better datasets identified by `[li2023rvf] HaluEval` and `[cao2023ecl] AutoHall`, but with a focus on fine-grained, analytical annotation and self-training.\n    *   `[yang20251dw] MetaQA` directly improves upon `[manakul20236ex] SelfCheckGPT` by addressing its limitations in generating diverse samples for consistency checks.\n    *   The numerous MLLM/LVLM/LALM papers extend the concept of \"mechanistic intervention\" from `[huang2023du3] OPERA` to a broader range of techniques (e.g., visual retracing, noise perturbation, multi-view reasoning).\n    *   The new surveys (`[pan2024y3a]`, `[li2025qzg]`, `[tonmoy20244e4]`, `[liu2024sn3]`, `[lan20240yz]`, `[bai2024tkm]`) directly synthesize and build upon the individual methods and insights from earlier papers in both the previous and new sets.\n    *   `[li2024qrj] The Dawn After the Dark` (HaluEval 2.0) is a direct successor and empirical expansion of `[li2023rvf] HaluEval`.\n\n*   **Overall Narrative Change/Strengthening:**\n    *   The overall narrative is significantly strengthened and diversified. The field has matured from primarily addressing text-based LLM hallucinations to a much broader, more nuanced, and modality-agnostic understanding.\n    *   The evolution now clearly shows a branching into multimodal AI, a deeper scientific inquiry into the *mechanisms* of hallucination, and a strong emphasis on *rigorous, automated, and fine-grained evaluation* as a prerequisite for effective mitigation.\n    *   The focus has expanded from merely detecting and correcting to proactively preventing, understanding the fundamental causes, and ensuring trustworthiness in high-stakes applications.\n\n**Temporal Positioning:**\nAll new papers are from 2024 or 2025, representing the latest and most cutting-edge developments in the field. They chronologically follow the 2023 papers in the previous synthesis, demonstrating a rapid acceleration of research in this area. `[ji20243j6] ANAH` (2024) precedes `[gu202414e] ANAH-v2` (2024), showing a direct progression within the same year. `[pan2024y3a]` (2024) updates `[pan2023mwu]` (2023).\n\n---\n\n2. *Updated Evolution Analysis:*\n\nThe research landscape of \"Hallucination in Large Language Models\" has undergone a rapid and profound evolution, expanding from initial detection and basic self-correction in text-only models to encompass complex multimodal scenarios, deep mechanistic understanding, and highly sophisticated, automated evaluation paradigms. The addition of numerous 2024 and 2025 papers reveals a field maturing with increased granularity, domain specificity, and a strong emphasis on trustworthiness.\n\n**Trend 1: From Post-Hoc Detection to Proactive Prevention and Self-Correction (LLMs)**\n\n*   *Methodological progression*: The journey began with *black-box detection* using consistency checks, as pioneered by `[manakul20236ex] SelfCheckGPT (2023)`. This was refined by `[cao2023ecl] AutoHall (2023)` through LLM-driven self-contradiction. The new paper `[yang20251dw] Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models with Metamorphic Relations (2025)` significantly advances this by introducing **MetaQA**, a zero-resource, self-contained detection method leveraging *metamorphic relations and prompt mutation*. This technique generates diverse response mutations (synonymous/antonymous) to expose factual inconsistencies, directly addressing the limitations of `SelfCheckGPT` where LLMs might repeat their own errors.\n    The focus on *self-correction during generation* was established by `[dhuliawala2023rqn] Chain-of-Verification (2023)` and `[ji2023vhv] Towards Mitigating Hallucination in Large Language Models via Self-Reflection (2023)`. This is now augmented by `[tjandra2024umq] Fine-Tuning Large Language Models to Appropriately Abstain with Semantic Entropy (2024)`, which introduces a novel, *label-free fine-tuning strategy* for LLMs to *abstain* from answering when uncertain, using *semantic entropy* to measure uncertainty robustly across generation lengths. This represents a more sophisticated, proactive prevention mechanism than earlier methods.\n*   *Problem evolution*: Initial work addressed the fundamental need for black-box detection. `SelfCheckGPT` tackled the inaccessibility of proprietary models. `[yang20251dw]` further addresses the problem of LLMs reinforcing their own errors during self-consistency checks, a critical flaw in prior zero-resource methods. The challenge of costly, label-dependent fine-tuning for abstention is overcome by `[tjandra2024umq]`, which provides a scalable, label-free solution for improving LLM trustworthiness in critical applications.\n*   *Key innovations*: `[yang20251dw]` innovates with the first application of *metamorphic relations* for hallucination detection. `[tjandra2024umq]` introduces *semantic entropy* for label-free abstention fine-tuning and the *Accuracy-Engagement Distance (AED)* metric for holistic evaluation of abstention-capable models.\n*   *Integration points*: `[yang20251dw]` directly builds upon and improves `[manakul20236ex] SelfCheckGPT`. `[tjandra2024umq]` extends the self-correction paradigm by focusing on proactive abstention, a more advanced form of prevention than merely detecting or correcting post-generation.\n\n**Trend 2: Deepening Understanding, Mechanistic Interventions, and Trustworthiness (LLMs)**\n\n*   *Methodological progression*: The field's understanding of hallucination has deepened significantly. Early surveys like `[pan2023mwu]` and `[zhang2023k1j]` provided initial taxonomies. This has been greatly expanded by new, comprehensive surveys: `[pan2024y3a] Automatically Correcting Large Language Models: Surveying the Landscape of Diverse Automated Correction Strategies (2024)` (an updated version of `[pan2023mwu]`), `[tonmoy20244e4] A Comprehensive Survey of Hallucination Mitigation Techniques in Large Language Models (2024)`, and `[li2025qzg] Loki's Dance of Illusions: A Comprehensive Survey of Hallucination in Large Language Models (2025)`. `[li2025qzg]` is particularly notable for proposing the *first unified theoretical framework* for hallucination, including its mathematical origins and inevitabilities.\n    Mechanistic interventions are also evolving. `[lv2024k5x] Coarse-to-Fine Highlighting: Reducing Knowledge Hallucination in Large Language Models (2024)` introduces **COFT**, a novel method for Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) that uses knowledge graphs and contextual weighting to dynamically highlight key information in long contexts, preventing LLMs from \"getting lost\" in irrelevant details. This builds on the idea of grounding LLMs in external knowledge. `[rejeleene2024okw] Towards Trustable Language Models: Investigating Information Quality of Large Language Models (2024)` shifts the conceptual focus to *Information Quality (IQ)*, proposing a mathematical framework based on consistency, relevance, and accuracy. Furthermore, `[hakim2024d4u] The Need for Guardrails with Large Language Models in Medical Safety-Critical Settings (2024)` introduces *semantic guardrails* (e.g., Document-wise Uncertainty Quantification, MISMATCH guardrail) for safety-critical domains like pharmacovigilance, moving beyond general mitigation to application-specific reliability.\n*   *Problem evolution*: The problem has evolved from simply identifying hallucinations to understanding their root causes, even at a theoretical level, and building systems that are not just accurate but also trustworthy and safe. `[li2024qrj] The Dawn After the Dark: An Empirical Study on Factuality Hallucination in Large Language Models (2024)` (HaluEval 2.0) provides a systematic empirical study across the LLM lifecycle (pre-training, SFT, RLHF, inference), addressing the need for a holistic understanding of hallucination sources. `[hakim2024d4u]` tackles the critical problem of \"never event\" errors in high-stakes medical applications.\n*   *Key innovations*: `[li2025qzg]` provides a formal mathematical definition of hallucination and a unified theoretical framework. `[lv2024k5x]` introduces the COFT framework for dynamic, coarse-to-fine context highlighting in RALMs. `[rejeleene2024okw]` proposes a novel mathematical formulation for Information Quality. `[hakim2024d4u]` innovates with \"hard\" and \"soft\" semantic guardrails for medical safety.\n*   *Integration points*: These papers collectively deepen the mechanistic understanding initiated by `[huang2023du3] OPERA` (which targeted self-attention patterns) and the comprehensive overview provided by earlier surveys. `[li2024qrj]` builds directly on `[li2023rvf] HaluEval` by creating HaluEval 2.0 and performing a deeper empirical analysis.\n\n**Trend 3: The Emergence of Multimodal Hallucination: Evaluation and Mitigation (MLLMs/LVLMs/LALMs)**\n\n*   *Methodological progression*: This is a significant new branch, extending hallucination research to models that integrate vision, audio, and language. `[huang2023du3] OPERA (2023)` was an early foray into MLLM hallucination. Now, a wave of papers specifically addresses this.\n    For *evaluation*, `[wu20241us] Unified Triplet-Level Hallucination Evaluation for Large Vision-Language Models (2024)` introduces triplet-level evaluation for *relation hallucination* in LVLMs. `[wang2024rta] VideoHallucer: Evaluating Intrinsic and Extrinsic Hallucinations in Large Video-Language Models (2024)` pioneers evaluation for *video-language models*, categorizing intrinsic and extrinsic hallucinations. `[kuan20249pm] Understanding Sounds, Missing the Questions: The Challenge of Object Hallucination in Large Audio-Language Models (2024)` introduces the first systematic evaluation of *object hallucination in Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs)*. `[kaul2024ta7] THRONE: An Object-Based Hallucination Benchmark for the Free-Form Generations of Large Vision-Language Models (2024)` focuses on \"Type I\" (free-form) hallucinations in LVLMs, using LM-based semantic judgment.\n    For *mitigation*, `[chen20247jb] Alleviating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models through Hallucination-Induced Optimization (2024)` proposes **HIO**, which trains an \"Evil LVLM\" to *induce* hallucinations for more effective contrastive decoding. `[zou2024dp7] Look Twice Before You Answer: Memory-Space Visual Retracing for Hallucination Mitigation in Multimodal Large Language Models (2024)` introduces **MemVR**, a plug-and-play decoding paradigm that re-injects visual tokens into intermediate layers to combat \"visual amnesia.\" `[wu2024n00] NoiseBoost: Alleviating Hallucination with Noise Perturbation for Multimodal Large Language Models (2024)` uses *noise perturbation* in visual features during training (SFT, RL, SSL) to balance attention. `[park20247cm] ConVis: Contrastive Decoding with Hallucination Visualization for Mitigating Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (2024)` innovates by using a *Text-to-Image (T2I) model to visualize potential hallucinations* for contrastive decoding. `[qu2024pqc] Look, Compare, Decide: Alleviating Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models via Multi-View Multi-Path Reasoning (2024)` introduces **MVP**, a training-free framework for multi-view information seeking and certainty-driven decoding. `[yin2025s2b] ClearSight: Visual Signal Enhancement for Object Hallucination Mitigation in Multimodal Large Language Models (2025)` proposes **Visual Amplification Fusion (VAF)** to enhance visual attention in middle layers without compromising speed or quality.\n    `[deng202405j] Efficient Self-Improvement in Multimodal Large Language Models: A Model-Level Judge-Free Approach (2024)` offers an efficient, *judge-free self-improvement framework* for MLLMs, using a controllable hallucination ratio and lightweight verifier.\n    The understanding of MLLM hallucination is further consolidated by several new surveys: `[liu2024sn3] A Survey on Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (2024)`, `[lan20240yz] A Survey of Hallucination in Large Visual Language Models (2024)`, and `[bai2024tkm] Hallucination of Multimodal Large Language Models: A Survey (2024)`.\n    Finally, `[wang2025jen] Mirage in the Eyes: Hallucination Attack on Multi-modal Large Language Models with Only Attention Sink (2025)` introduces a novel *hallucination attack* that exploits the \"attention sink\" phenomenon, providing a new way to understand MLLM vulnerabilities.\n*   *Problem evolution*: The problem space expanded to address cross-modal inconsistencies, where LLMs misinterpret or fabricate visual/audio information. This includes specific challenges like relation hallucination (`[wu20241us]`), video-specific temporal/semantic details (`[wang2024rta]`), and object hallucination in audio (`[kuan20249pm]`). Mitigation efforts now tackle issues like \"visual amnesia\" (`[zou2024dp7]`), modality imbalance (`[wu2024n00]`), and the need for efficient, judge-free self-improvement (`[deng202405j]`).\n*   *Key innovations*: Triplet-level evaluation (`[wu20241us]`), intrinsic/extrinsic video hallucination taxonomy (`[wang2024rta]`), ECHO/Cover metrics for LALMs (`[kuan20249pm]`), HIO with \"Evil LVLM\" (`[chen20247jb]`), MemVR's visual retracing (`[zou2024dp7]`), NoiseBoost's noise perturbation (`[wu2024n00]`), ConVis's T2I-based visualization (`[park20247cm]`), MVP's multi-view multi-path reasoning (`[qu2024pqc]`), VAF's visual amplification fusion (`[yin2025s2b]`), judge-free self-improvement (`[deng202405j]`), and the attention sink attack (`[wang2025jen]`).\n*   *Integration points*: This trend builds on the initial recognition of MLLM hallucination by `[huang2023du3] OPERA`, expanding the scope to various modalities and a diverse set of evaluation and mitigation techniques.\n\n**Trend 4: Advanced & Automated Benchmarking for Fine-Grained and Complex Reasoning Hallucinations**\n\n*   *Methodological progression*: The field has moved beyond general benchmarks to highly specialized, automated, and fine-grained evaluation. `[li2023rvf] HaluEval` and `[cao2023ecl] AutoHall` laid the groundwork for automated benchmark generation. This is now significantly advanced by `[ji20243j6] ANAH: Analytical Annotation of Hallucinations in Large Language Models (2024)`, which introduces a large-scale, bilingual dataset with *sentence-level, analytical annotation* (type, reference, correction), and its successor `[gu202414e] ANAH-v2: Scaling Analytical Hallucination Annotation of Large Language Models (2024)`, which uses an iterative self-training framework to scale this fine-grained annotation.\n    `[oh2024xa3] ERBench: An Entity-Relationship based Automatically Verifiable Hallucination Benchmark for Large Language Models (2024)` introduces a novel approach using *relational databases (RDBs)* and their integrity constraints to generate complex, automatically verifiable questions and, crucially, *verify LLM rationales*. `[tang2024a1j] GraphArena: Evaluating and Exploring Large Language Models on Graph Computation (2024)` pushes evaluation into *complex reasoning domains* by using real-world graphs and NP-complete problems, with a rigorous *path-based evaluation* that assesses the entire solution process.\n    `[liang2024hoo] THaMES: An End-to-End Tool for Hallucination Mitigation and Evaluation in Large Language Models (2024)` provides a comprehensive framework for automated testset generation, multifaceted evaluation (identification and generation), and adaptive mitigation. `[qiu2024zyc] LongHalQA: Long-Context Hallucination Evaluation for MultiModal Large Language Models (2024)` addresses the critical gap of *long-context hallucinations* in MLLMs with an LLM-free, MCQ-based evaluation.\n*   *Problem evolution*: The problem has evolved from simply needing \"large-scale\" benchmarks to requiring \"fine-grained,\" \"rationale-verifiable,\" \"complex-reasoning,\" and \"long-context\" evaluations. `[ji20243j6]` and `[gu202414e]` tackle the cost and scalability of detailed annotation. `[oh2024xa3]` addresses the limitation of simple QA benchmarks by enabling the evaluation of LLM thought processes. `[tang2024a1j]` confronts the challenge of evaluating LLMs on tasks requiring genuine algorithmic reasoning beyond memorization. `[qiu2024zyc]` highlights the limitations of existing benchmarks in capturing hallucinations in realistic, extended MLLM interactions.\n*   *Key innovations*: `[ji20243j6]` and `[gu202414e]` introduce sentence-level analytical annotation and iterative self-training for dataset scaling. `[oh2024xa3]` innovates with RDB-based benchmark generation and automatic rationale verification. `[tang2024a1j]` introduces real-world graph problems and path-based evaluation for algorithmic reasoning. `[liang2024hoo]` provides an end-to-end tool with sophisticated hallucinated answer generation using an \"Ensemble Score.\" `[qiu2024zyc]` pioneers LLM-free, MCQ-based evaluation for long-context multimodal hallucinations.\n*   *Integration points*: These papers build directly on the need for comprehensive evaluation identified by `[li2023rvf] HaluEval` and `[cao2023ecl] AutoHall`, pushing the boundaries of automation, granularity, and complexity in benchmarking. `[ji20243j6]` and `[gu202414e]` are direct successors in fine-grained dataset creation.\n\n3. *Refined Synthesis*:\nThe intellectual trajectory of hallucination research has dramatically expanded, evolving from fundamental black-box detection and basic self-correction in text-only LLMs to a sophisticated, multi-faceted endeavor. This expanded view reveals a field now deeply engaged in understanding the *mechanisms* of hallucination, developing *proactive prevention* strategies, and, most significantly, rigorously addressing the unique challenges of *multimodal hallucinations* across vision, audio, and language. The collective contribution of these works is a comprehensive framework for evaluating, understanding, and mitigating hallucinations, pushing towards more reliable, trustworthy, and contextually grounded large language and multimodal models across an increasingly diverse array of applications.",

        "title": "SelfCheckGPT: Zero-Resource Black-Box Hallucination Detection for Generative Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 are capable of generating highly fluent responses to a wide variety of user prompts. However, LLMs are known to hallucinate facts and make non-factual statements which can undermine trust in their output. Existing fact-checking approaches either require access to the output probability distribution (which may not be available for systems such as ChatGPT) or external databases that are interfaced via separate, often complex, modules. In this work, we propose\"SelfCheckGPT\", a simple sampling-based approach that can be used to fact-check the responses of black-box models in a zero-resource fashion, i.e. without an external database. SelfCheckGPT leverages the simple idea that if an LLM has knowledge of a given concept, sampled responses are likely to be similar and contain consistent facts. However, for hallucinated facts, stochastically sampled responses are likely to diverge and contradict one another. We investigate this approach by using GPT-3 to generate passages about individuals from the WikiBio dataset, and manually annotate the factuality of the generated passages. We demonstrate that SelfCheckGPT can: i) detect non-factual and factual sentences; and ii) rank passages in terms of factuality. We compare our approach to several baselines and show that our approach has considerably higher AUC-PR scores in sentence-level hallucination detection and higher correlation scores in passage-level factuality assessment compared to grey-box methods.",
        "summary": "Here is a focused summary of the technical paper for literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently \"hallucinate\" facts, producing non-factual statements that undermine trust in their outputs \\cite{manakul20236ex}.\n    *   This problem is critical because LLMs are widely used in applications like report drafting and virtual assistants, where factual accuracy is paramount.\n    *   Existing hallucination detection methods are limited:\n        *   Some require access to the LLM's internal output probability distributions (e.g., token probabilities or entropy), which are often unavailable for black-box models accessed via APIs (e.g., ChatGPT).\n        *   Others rely on external databases for fact verification, which can be complex, costly, and only assess facts relative to the database's knowledge, not general LLM hallucinations.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   Previous work on hallucination detection includes intrinsic uncertainty metrics (e.g., token probability, entropy) and fact-verification approaches using external databases \\cite{manakul20236ex}.\n    *   Uncertainty metrics (e.g., Yuan et al., 2021; Fu et al., 2023) are \"grey-box\" methods requiring access to token-level probabilities, which is a significant limitation for many commercial LLMs.\n    *   Fact-verification methods (e.g., Thorne et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2022) are \"resource-intensive\" as they depend on external knowledge bases.\n    *   Other approaches, like using hidden representations for truthfulness prediction (Azaria and Mitchell, 2023) or self-evaluation (Kadavath et al., 2022), are either white-box or require specific prompting strategies.\n    *   SelfCheckGPT is positioned as the first zero-resource, black-box hallucination detection solution for general LLM responses, addressing the limitations of prior methods by not requiring internal model access or external databases.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   The core idea of SelfCheckGPT is that if an LLM genuinely \"knows\" a concept, stochastically sampled responses to the same prompt will be consistent and contain similar facts \\cite{manakul20236ex}. Conversely, for hallucinated facts, sampled responses are likely to diverge and contradict one another.\n    *   It operates by generating multiple stochastic samples (N samples) from the black-box LLM using the same query as the original response to be evaluated.\n    *   The method then measures the informational consistency between the original response's sentences and these generated samples.\n    *   Five variants for measuring consistency are proposed:\n        *   **BERTScore**: Compares the i-th sentence of the original response with the most similar sentence from each sampled response using BERTScore. A lower score indicates higher inconsistency.\n        *   **Question Answering (QA)**: Generates multiple-choice questions from the original response's sentences and uses an independent QA system to answer them based on the original response and each sample. Inconsistency is measured by how often answers based on samples mismatch the answer based on the original response.\n        *   **n-gram**: Trains a simple n-gram language model on the collected samples (and the original response) to approximate the LLM's token probabilities. Hallucinations are indicated by lower (more negative) log-probabilities.\n        *   **Natural Language Inference (NLI)**: Uses an NLI model (e.g., DeBERTa-v3-large fine-tuned on MNLI) to determine if a sampled passage contradicts the sentence being assessed. The average contradiction probability across samples serves as the score.\n        *   **LLM Prompting**: Queries another LLM (e.g., GPT-3) to directly assess whether a given sentence is supported by a sampled response (context) using a simple \"Yes/No\" prompt. The proportion of \"No\" answers indicates inconsistency.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Sampling-Based Paradigm**: Introduces a novel sampling-based approach for hallucination detection that leverages the inherent stochasticity of LLMs.\n    *   **Zero-Resource & Black-Box Applicability**: Develops a method that works without external databases and without requiring access to the LLM's internal states or token probabilities, making it applicable to proprietary black-box models.\n    *   **Multiple Consistency Measures**: Proposes and evaluates five distinct technical methods (BERTScore, QA, n-gram, NLI, LLM Prompting) for quantifying informational consistency, offering flexibility and robustness.\n    *   **Empirical Demonstration**: Provides a strong first baseline for black-box hallucination detection, demonstrating its effectiveness even against grey-box methods.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Dataset Creation**: A custom dataset was created by using GPT-3 (text-davinci-003) to generate synthetic Wikipedia articles based on concepts from the WikiBio dataset.\n    *   **Manual Annotation**: 1908 generated sentences were manually annotated for factuality into three categories: Major Inaccurate (1), Minor Inaccurate (0.5), and Accurate (0). Inter-annotator agreement (Cohen's κ) was moderate to substantial (0.595 for 3-class, 0.748 for 2-class).\n    *   **Metrics**:\n        *   **Sentence-level hallucination detection**: Evaluated using Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUC-PR).\n        *   **Passage-level factuality assessment**: Evaluated using correlation scores (e.g., Pearson, Spearman) between predicted and annotated factuality scores.\n    *   **Key Results**:\n        *   SelfCheckGPT variants, particularly SelfCheckGPT-Prompt and SelfCheckGPT-NLI, achieved considerably higher AUC-PR scores for sentence-level hallucination detection compared to grey-box methods (e.g., token probability, entropy) and a proxy LLM approach.\n        *   SelfCheckGPT also showed higher correlation scores for passage-level factuality assessment.\n        *   The approach demonstrated the ability to detect both non-factual and factual sentences and rank passages by factuality.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Sampling Quality**: The effectiveness relies on the quality and diversity of the stochastically generated samples. A limited number of samples (N=20 in experiments) might not fully capture the LLM's knowledge distribution.\n    *   **LLM Capability for Prompting**: The LLM Prompting variant requires a sufficiently capable LLM to perform consistency assessment effectively; less capable models (e.g., GPT-3 text-curie-001, LLaMA) failed in initial investigations.\n    *   **Synthetic Dataset**: The evaluation was conducted on a synthetically generated dataset (GPT-3 on WikiBio), which might not fully represent the diversity and complexity of real-world LLM outputs across all tasks.\n    *   **Computational Cost**: Generating multiple samples and performing consistency checks (especially with QA or LLM prompting) can incur significant computational and API costs.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   SelfCheckGPT significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in LLM hallucination detection by providing a practical, zero-resource, and black-box solution.\n    *   It offers a robust method for assessing the trustworthiness of LLM outputs without requiring privileged access to model internals or reliance on external knowledge bases.\n    *   This work establishes a strong baseline for future research in black-box factuality assessment and opens avenues for developing more sophisticated consistency-based detection mechanisms.\n    *   Its potential impact includes improving the reliability of LLM applications, fostering greater user trust, and enabling broader deployment of LLMs in sensitive domains.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are prone to generate hallucinations, i.e., content that conflicts with the source or cannot be verified by the factual knowledge. To understand what types of content and to which extent LLMs are apt to hallucinate, we introduce the Hallucination Evaluation benchmark for Large Language Models (HaluEval), a large collection of generated and human-annotated hallucinated samples for evaluating the performance of LLMs in recognizing hallucination. To generate these samples, we propose a ChatGPT-based two-step framework, i.e., sampling-then-filtering. Besides, we also hire some human labelers to annotate the hallucinations in ChatGPT responses. The empirical results suggest that ChatGPT is likely to generate hallucinated content in specific topics by fabricating unverifiable information (i.e., about $19.5\\%$ responses). Moreover, existing LLMs face great challenges in recognizing the hallucinations in texts. However, our experiments also prove that providing external knowledge or adding reasoning steps can help LLMs recognize hallucinations.

Existing work primarily investigates causes for specific tasks and smaller language models, leaving it unclear what types of content and to what extent *general* LLMs hallucinate, and how well they can *recognize* such errors.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Previous research largely focused on investigating the causes of hallucination for specific tasks and smaller language models \\cite{li2023rvf}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: These prior efforts did not provide a comprehensive understanding of the types and extent of hallucinations in large, general-purpose LLMs like ChatGPT, nor did they offer a robust benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to recognize hallucinations across diverse tasks \\cite{li2023rvf}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper introduces HaluEval, a large-scale benchmark comprising 35,000 hallucinated/normal samples. Its construction involves two main strategies:\n        *   **Automatic Generation (Sampling-then-Filtering Framework)**: For task-specific examples (Question Answering, Knowledge-Grounded Dialogue, Text Summarization), a two-stage process is proposed:\n            *   **Diverse Hallucination Sampling**: ChatGPT is prompted using carefully designed instructions (intention description, hallucination patterns, few-shot demonstrations) to generate diverse hallucinated samples. Two sampling methods are used: a one-pass instruction schema and a conversational schema, aiming for multi-facet hallucinations.\n            *   **High-quality Hallucination Filtering**: ChatGPT acts as an \"answer judge\" to select the most plausible and difficult hallucinated samples from the candidates generated in the first stage. This filtering instruction is enhanced by ground-truth examples, guiding ChatGPT to choose the hallucinated answer closest to the correct one, making it harder for other LLMs to identify.\n        *   **Human Annotation**: For general user queries, 5,000 ChatGPT responses are human-annotated. A pre-selection procedure identifies queries where LLMs are most likely to hallucinate by selecting responses with low semantic similarity among multiple ChatGPT generations. Human labelers then identify and mark hallucinated spans (unverifiable, non-factual, or irrelevant content).\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   **Large-scale, Multi-task Benchmark**: HaluEval is a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating hallucination in *large* language models across general queries and three distinct NLP tasks \\cite{li2023rvf}.\n        *   **Automated Hallucination Generation**: The `sampling-then-filtering` framework leverages LLMs (ChatGPT) to automatically generate high-quality, challenging hallucinated samples, which is a novel approach to benchmark creation \\cite{li2023rvf}.\n        *   **Instruction Design for Controlled Hallucination**: The detailed instruction design, incorporating specific hallucination patterns and demonstrations, allows for controlled and diverse generation of hallucinated content tailored to different tasks \\cite{li2023rvf}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Benchmark**: Introduction of HaluEval, a large-scale benchmark (35,000 samples) for evaluating LLM hallucination generation and recognition \\cite{li2023rvf}.\n    *   **Automated Hallucination Generation Framework**: A two-stage `sampling-then-filtering` framework that uses LLMs to automatically generate diverse and challenging hallucinated samples for various tasks \\cite{li2023rvf}.\n    *   **Instruction Design for Hallucination Control**: Detailed instruction templates for LLMs to generate specific types of hallucinations (e.g., factualness, specificity, inference for QA) and to filter for high-quality, plausible hallucinated examples \\cite{li2023rvf}.\n    *   **Human-Annotated Dataset**: A collection of 5,000 human-annotated ChatGPT responses to general user queries, providing insights into real-world hallucination tendencies \\cite{li2023rvf}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: The paper evaluated several state-of-the-art LLMs (5 closed-source including ChatGPT, Claude 2; 5 open-source including Llama 2, Alpaca) on their ability to classify whether a given text contains hallucinated content using the HaluEval benchmark \\cite{li2023rvf}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   **Hallucination Generation**: Human annotation revealed that approximately 19.5% of ChatGPT's responses to general user queries contained hallucinated content, often fabricating unverifiable information related to specific topics (e.g., language, climate, technology) \\cite{li2023rvf}.\n        *   **Hallucination Recognition**: Existing LLMs, including ChatGPT, face significant challenges in recognizing hallucinations. ChatGPT achieved an accuracy of 62.59% for question answering and 79.44% for general queries, while other models like Alpaca performed much worse (e.g., 6.68% for QA) \\cite{li2023rvf}.\n        *   **Mitigation Strategies**: Experiments showed that providing explicit external knowledge or adding intermediate reasoning steps significantly improved LLMs' performance in recognizing hallucinations. Conversely, contrasting hallucinated samples directly with ground-truth answers tended to confuse LLMs and degrade performance \\cite{li2023rvf}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The automatic generation relies on the capabilities of a powerful LLM (ChatGPT) for both sampling and filtering, which might introduce biases inherent to that model. The definition of \"hallucination\" is based on unverifiable, non-factual, or irrelevant content, which might not cover all nuances of LLM errors \\cite{li2023rvf}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The benchmark covers general user queries and three specific NLP tasks (QA, dialogue, summarization). While adaptable, its direct applicability to other specialized tasks might require further instruction design and validation \\cite{li2023rvf}.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: HaluEval significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing the first large-scale, multi-task benchmark specifically designed to systematically evaluate hallucination in *large* language models, moving beyond task-specific or small-model analyses \\cite{li2023rvf}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n        *   Enables deeper analysis of what types of content LLMs tend to hallucinate and to what extent \\cite{li2023rvf}.\n        *   Provides a robust evaluation tool for assessing and comparing LLMs' ability to recognize and mitigate hallucinations \\cite{li2023rvf}.\n        *   Facilitates the development of new methods and techniques for hallucination detection and reduction in LLMs, particularly by exploring the benefits of external knowledge and reasoning steps \\cite{li2023rvf}.",

        "abstract": "While Large language models (LLMs) have garnered widespread applications across various domains due to their powerful language understanding and generation capabilities, the detection of non-factual or hallucinatory content generated by LLMs remains scarce. Currently, one significant challenge in hallucination detection is the laborious task of time-consuming and expensive manual annotation of the hallucinatory generation. To address this issue, this paper first introduces a method for automatically constructing model-specific hallucination datasets based on existing fact-checking datasets called AutoHall. Furthermore, we propose a zero-resource and black-box hallucination detection method based on self-contradiction. We conduct experiments towards prevalent open-/closed-source LLMs, achieving superior hallucination detection performance compared to extant baselines. Moreover, our experiments reveal variations in hallucination proportions and types among different models.",

A major challenge in hallucination detection is the laborious, time-consuming, and expensive nature of manual annotation for creating model-specific hallucination datasets. These datasets are also time-sensitive, becoming obsolete with LLM upgrades \\cite{cao2023ecl}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to existing approaches**: Prior work on hallucination detection either leverages external knowledge sources (e.g., CRITIC \\cite{gou2023critic}, search engines \\cite{chern2023invoking}) or adopts zero-resource approaches focusing on inherent model resources (e.g., Chain of Thoughts \\cite{xue2023hallucination}, sampling-based methods like SelfCheckGPT \\cite{manakul2023selfcheckgpt}). Various hallucination benchmarks also exist, often relying on human annotation \\cite{li2023hallucination, umapathi2023hallucination, dale2023human}.\n    *   **Limitations of previous solutions**: Existing methods are often constrained by the need for manually annotated, model-specific, and time-sensitive datasets, which are expensive and do not scale well with frequent model updates. Furthermore, there is still significant room for improvement in the performance of current hallucination detection techniques \\cite{cao2023ecl}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core technical method or algorithm**:\n        *   **AutoHall (Automated Hallucination Dataset Generation)**: A three-step pipeline to automatically construct model-specific hallucination datasets from existing fact-checking datasets (which contain claims with ground truth labels and evidence).\n            1.  **References Generation**: An LLM is prompted to generate references for claims.\n            2.  **Claim Classification**: The LLM is then prompted to classify whether each generated reference supports or refutes the original claim.\n            3.  **Hallucination Collection**: If the LLM's classification contradicts the ground truth label of the claim, the generated reference is labeled as hallucinatory \\cite{cao2023ecl}.\n        *   **Zero-Resource, Black-Box Hallucination Detection**: A method based on self-contradiction. For a given claim and an LLM's initial response, the LLM is independently queried multiple times (K times) to generate additional references. The LLM then detects contradictions between the original response and each of the K sampled references. If any contradiction is found, the original response is flagged as hallucinatory \\cite{cao2023ecl}.\n    *   **What makes this approach novel or different**:\n        *   AutoHall innovates by automating the creation of hallucination datasets, eliminating the need for costly and time-consuming manual annotation and addressing the issue of dataset obsolescence with model upgrades \\cite{cao2023ecl}.\n        *   The detection method is novel in its end-to-end use of the LLM for self-contradiction detection, directly comparing the original response with independently sampled ones.

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n### Technical Paper Analysis: Chain-of-Verification Reduces Hallucination in Large Language Models \\cite{dhuliawala2023rqn}\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the persistent issue of \"hallucination\" in Large Language Models (LLMs), where models generate plausible but factually incorrect information. This is particularly problematic for lesser-known facts and in longform text generation where errors can compound.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: Hallucinations undermine the trustworthiness and reliability of LLM outputs, limiting their applicability in critical domains. It's challenging because even the largest models, despite improved reasoning capabilities, still exhibit this behavior, and simply scaling up doesn't resolve it.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: This work falls under \"generation-time correction\" methods, which aim to improve LLM reliability by adding reasoning decisions on top of the base model. It builds on research encouraging LLMs to generate internal thoughts or reasoning chains (e.g., Chain-of-Thought) and self-critique.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   **Training-time correction**: Requires adjusting model weights, which can be complex.\n        *   **Generation-time correction**: Some methods rely on token probabilities or multiple samples, which may not always be robust. Approaches using inconsistencies (e.g., LM vs LM) are related but often involve multi-agent setups.\n        *   **Augmentation (tool-use)**: While effective (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation), CoVe specifically focuses on *self-correction* using only the LLM's internal knowledge, without external tools like search engines.\n        *   **Self-critique/verification**: Previous self-verification methods often focus on logical/mathematical tasks or specific question-answer formats, whereas CoVe targets factual hallucination across diverse generation tasks. CoVe's \"factored\" approach specifically addresses the issue of LLMs repeating their own hallucinations when conditioning on prior incorrect generations.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method (Chain-of-Verification - CoVe)**: CoVe is a four-step process designed to enable an LLM to deliberate on and correct its own responses:\n        1.  **Generate Baseline Response**: The LLM produces an initial draft.\n        2.  **Plan Verifications**: Conditioned on the query and baseline response, the LLM generates a list of specific verification questions to fact-check claims in the draft.\n        3.  **Execute Verifications**: The LLM answers these verification questions. Crucially, several variants are explored:\n            *   **Joint**: Planning and execution in a single prompt, potentially leading to repetition.\n            *   **2-Step**: Separates planning (conditions on baseline) and execution (answers questions without conditioning on baseline) to reduce repetition.\n            *   **Factored**: Answers *each* verification question independently as a separate prompt, without conditioning on the original baseline response or other verification answers. This is the most sophisticated and aims to minimize bias and repetition.\n            *   **Factor+Revise**: Adds an explicit cross-checking step after factored execution to detect inconsistencies.\n        4.  **Generate Final Verified Response**: The LLM produces a revised response, incorporating the insights and corrections from the verification steps.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   **Systematic Self-Deliberation**: CoVe provides a structured, multi-step framework for LLMs to self-critique and verify factual claims *internally*, without external tools.\n        *   **Independent Verification Execution**: The \"factored\" variant is particularly novel, ensuring that verification questions are answered independently of the potentially hallucinated baseline response and other verification answers, thereby preventing the model from repeating its own mistakes. This addresses the \"exposure bias\" problem.\n        *   **LLM-only Verification**: Unlike retrieval-augmented methods, CoVe relies solely on the LLM's inherent knowledge and reasoning capabilities for verification.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithm/Method**: Introduction of the Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) method, a multi-stage self-correction pipeline for LLMs.\n    *   **Algorithmic Innovations**: Development of \"factored\" variants for executing verification questions, which significantly reduce the likelihood of repeating hallucinations by answering questions independently of the initial response and other verification contexts.\n    *   **System Design**: A modular design where each step (draft, plan, execute, revise) is performed by prompting the same base LLM, allowing for flexible integration and variant exploration.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: CoVe was evaluated across a variety of tasks:\n        *   **List-based questions**: Wikidata (easier) and Wiki-Category list (harder), requiring generation of sets of entities.\n        *   **Closed-book MultiSpanQA**: Factoid-based questions with multiple independent answers.\n        *   **Longform text generation**: Generating biographies of entities.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results**:\n        *   **Metrics**: Precision (for list-based tasks), FACTSCORE (for longform biographies), and average number of positive/negative (hallucinated) entities.\n        *   **Baselines**: Llama 65B (few-shot), Llama 2 70B Chat (zero-shot, CoT).\n        *   **Results**:\n            *   CoVe consistently decreased hallucinations and improved precision across all tasks compared to baseline LLM generations.\n            *   On Wikidata, Llama 65B CoVe (two-step) achieved 0.36 precision vs. 0.17 for Llama 65B Few-shot, significantly reducing negative entities (0.68 vs 2.95).\n            *   On Wiki-Category list, Llama 65B CoVe (factored) achieved 0.22 precision vs. 0.12 for Llama 65B Few-shot.\n            *   The \"factored\" and \"two-step\" variants generally outperformed the \"joint\" method, demonstrating the importance of separating verification steps and avoiding conditioning on the initial response.\n            *   For longform biography generation, CoVe significantly improved FACTSCORE, indicating higher factual correctness.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**:\n        *   Relies on the base LLM's ability to generate and execute verification plans, and to reason about inconsistencies.\n        *   Does not explore tool-use (e.g., retrieval-augmentation via search engines) for verification, relying solely on the LLM's internal knowledge.\n        *   The \"factored\" approach, while effective, can be computationally more expensive due to requiring many separate LLM prompts, though these can be batched.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: Primarily demonstrated for factual hallucination in text generation tasks (list generation, QA, biographies). While the principles might extend, its direct applicability to other types of LLM errors (e.g., logical fallacies, coherence issues) is not explicitly explored.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advance State-of-the-Art**: CoVe significantly advances the state-of-the-art in reducing factual hallucinations in LLMs by introducing a systematic, self-deliberative framework. It demonstrates that LLMs can effectively self-correct by planning and executing internal verification steps.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n        *   **Enhanced LLM Reliability**: Provides a robust method for improving the factual accuracy of LLM outputs, making them more trustworthy for various applications.\n        *   **Self-Correction Paradigms**: Opens avenues for further research into more sophisticated LLM self-correction mechanisms, potentially integrating external tools with internal deliberation.\n        *   **Understanding LLM Reasoning**: Offers insights into how LLMs can be prompted to perform complex reasoning and self-critique, moving beyond simple next-token prediction.\n        *   **Mitigating Exposure Bias**: The success of factored variants highlights the importance of careful context management in multi-step LLM reasoning to prevent error propagation.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for generative and knowledge-intensive tasks including question-answering (QA) tasks. However, the practical deployment still faces challenges, notably the issue of\"hallucination\", where models generate plausible-sounding but unfaithful or nonsensical information. This issue becomes particularly critical in the medical domain due to the uncommon professional concepts and potential social risks involved. This paper analyses the phenomenon of hallucination in medical generative QA systems using widely adopted LLMs and datasets. Our investigation centers on the identification and comprehension of common problematic answers, with a specific emphasis on hallucination. To tackle this challenge, we present an interactive self-reflection methodology that incorporates knowledge acquisition and answer generation. Through this feedback process, our approach steadily enhances the factuality, consistency, and entailment of the generated answers. Consequently, we harness the interactivity and multitasking ability of LLMs and produce progressively more precise and accurate answers. Experimental results on both automatic and human evaluation demonstrate the superiority of our approach in hallucination reduction compared to baselines.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n**1. Research Problem & Motivation**\n*   **Specific Technical Problem:** The paper addresses the critical issue of \"hallucination\" in Large Language Models (LLMs), where models generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect, unfaithful, or nonsensical information \\cite{ji2023vhv}.\n*   **Importance and Challenge:** This problem is particularly acute and challenging in the medical domain due to:\n    *   The severe social and patient care risks associated with inaccurate or misleading medical information.\n    *   The complexity and specialized nature of professional medical concepts, which exacerbate the difficulty of ensuring factual accuracy in generative question-answering (GQA) tasks \\cite{ji2023vhv}.\n    *   A recognized gap in the current understanding of the prevalence and nature of hallucination in medical answers generated by LLMs.\n\n**2. Related Work & Positioning**\n*   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** The work acknowledges the progress in medical QA systems and faithful GQA, which aim to ground answers in source text or valid external knowledge \\cite{ji2023vhv}. It also notes efforts to leverage LLMs' parametric knowledge for knowledge-intensive tasks.\n*   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n    *   Traditional n-gram similarity metrics (e.g., F1, ROUGE-L) commonly used in GQA often fail to effectively discriminate hallucinated or incorrect answers and show weak correlation with human judgments \\cite{ji2023vhv}.\n    *   While approaches like Rationale-Enriched Answer Generator (REAG) and Read-before-Generate aim to improve faithfulness, the fundamental challenge of hallucination persists, especially in complex, high-stakes domains like medicine \\cite{ji2023vhv}.\n    *   Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs still face significant challenges regarding control, bias, and reliability, with hallucination being an increasingly visible issue \\cite{ji2023vhv}.\n\n**3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n*   **Core Technical Method:** The paper introduces an **iterative self-reflection methodology** that harnesses the multi-turn interactivity and multi-task abilities inherent in LLMs \\cite{ji2023vhv}. This method operates in two main stages:\n    *   **Knowledge Acquisition Stage:** For a given question, the LLM first generates relevant background knowledge. This generated knowledge is then subjected to a factuality evaluation (scoring). If factual discrepancies are detected, the LLM is prompted to self-correct and refine the knowledge. This cyclical process continues until a satisfactory level of factuality is achieved.\n    *   **Answer Generation Stage:** Based on the refined background knowledge, the LLM generates an answer. This answer is subsequently scored for consistency with the acquired knowledge and for entailment with the original question. If the generated answer does not meet the required standards, it undergoes refinement; if still problematic, the process can revert to the Knowledge Acquisition Stage \\cite{ji2023vhv}.\n*   **Novelty/Difference:** The core innovation lies in its **dynamic, introspective feedback loop** \\cite{ji2023vhv}. Unlike static generation or purely retrieval-augmented methods, this approach enables the LLM to actively evaluate its own generated knowledge and answers, identify shortcomings, and iteratively refine them. This self-correction mechanism allows for a progressive enhancement of factuality, consistency, and entailment directly within the LLM's generative process.\n\n**4. Key Technical Contributions**\n*   **Novel Algorithms/Methods:** A novel **self-reflection method** designed to mitigate hallucination in LLMs, characterized by an iterative feedback loop that systematically generates, scores, and refines both background knowledge and answers until they achieve satisfactory levels of accuracy and reliability \\cite{ji2023vhv}.\n*   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis:** A comprehensive analysis and categorization of hallucination phenomena in medical GQA systems, identifying \"Fact Inconsistency,\" \"Query Inconsistency\" (both considered hallucination), and \"Tangentiality\" as distinct types of problematic answers \\cite{ji2023vhv}. The study also explores potential contributing factors, such as the impact of medical domain fine-tuning and a correlation between low keyword frequency and increased hallucination incidence.\n\n**5. Experimental Validation**\n*   **Experiments Conducted:**\n    *   An initial comprehensive analysis of hallucination occurrence across five diverse LLMs (Vicuna, Alpaca-LoRA, ChatGPT, MedAlpaca, Robin-medical) on five widely used medical GQA datasets (PubMedQA, MedQuAD, MEDIQA2019, LiveMedQA2017, MASH-QA) \\cite{ji2023vhv}.\n    *   Comparative evaluation of the proposed self-reflection method (denoted with `_L`) against the baseline LLMs on the same five datasets.\n*   **Key Performance Metrics:**\n    *   **Traditional GQA Metrics:** Unigram F1 and ROUGE-L.\n    *   **Novel Hallucination-focused Metrics:** Med-NLI (Medical Natural Language Inference) at both sample and sentence levels to assess logical consistency and entailment, and CTRL-Eval (an unsupervised, reference-free metric) specifically for consistency \\cite{ji2023vhv}.\n*   **Comparison Results:**\n    *   The self-reflection method (`_L`) consistently demonstrated **superior performance** in hallucination reduction across all tested LLMs (ranging from 7B to 175B parameters) and all five medical datasets \\cite{ji2023vhv}.\n    *   Significant improvements were observed across MedNLI, CtrlEval, F1, and ROUGE-L scores when the self-reflection loop was applied, indicating enhanced factuality, consistency, and entailment.\n    *   The results highlighted the **effectiveness, generalizability, and scalability** of the approach, showcasing its ability to improve LLM responses in medical GQA tasks without explicit dataset-specific training \\cite{ji2023vhv}.\n    *   Initial analysis also revealed that while medical fine-tuning can be beneficial, its effectiveness varies (e.g., MedAlpaca outperformed Robin-medical), suggesting that instruction learning is more suitable for GQA tasks \\cite{ji2023vhv}.\n\n**6. Limitations & Scope**\n*   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:**\n    *   The paper explicitly notes the limitations of traditional n-gram metrics for evaluating hallucination, necessitating the development and use of more nuanced metrics like Med-NLI and CTRL-Eval \\cite{ji2023vhv}.\n    *   The analysis of keyword frequency as a potential cause of hallucination uses Google N-grams as a proxy for pre-training data distribution, acknowledging this as an approximation \\cite{ji2023vhv}.\n    *   The method relies on the LLM's inherent capabilities for multi-turn interaction, multi-task processing, and self-reflection, assuming these are sufficiently robust for effective self-correction \\cite{ji2023vhv}.\n*   **Scope of Applicability:** The method is specifically validated and shown to be effective for **medical generative question-answering systems** \\cite{ji2023vhv}. While its generalizability across different LLM sizes and medical datasets is demonstrated, its direct applicability and performance in other domains or for different types of generative tasks (e.g., creative content generation) would require further dedicated investigation.\n\n**7. Technical Significance**\n*   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** This work significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in mitigating LLM hallucination by introducing an **innovative, iterative self-reflection paradigm** \\cite{ji2023vhv}. It moves beyond passive generation or simple retrieval-augmented methods by empowering LLMs to actively evaluate, critique, and refine their own generated knowledge and answers, leading to demonstrably more factual, consistent, and reliable outputs.\n*   **Potential Impact on Future Research:**\n    *   Provides a robust and generalizable framework for enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-enabled medical services, which is crucial for their safe and effective deployment \\cite{ji2023vhv}.\n    *   Opens new avenues for research into deeper LLM introspection, self-correction, and autonomous reasoning capabilities, potentially leading to more robust and less error-prone AI systems.\n    *   The introduction of specialized evaluation metrics like Med-NLI and the use of CTRL-Eval for consistency offers improved tools for assessing faithfulness, which can guide future research in both hallucination detection and mitigation \\cite{ji2023vhv}.\n    *   The methodology is designed to be extensible, allowing for future integration with other techniques, such as external knowledge bases or more powerful LLMs, to further enhance the development of highly reliable application systems \\cite{ji2023vhv}.",

This provides a crucial overview of the empirical landscape for future research.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical limitations or assumptions:**\n        The survey primarily concentrates on **fact-conflicting hallucinations**, acknowledging that input- and context-conflicting types have been extensively studied in conventional NLG and are particularly prone to occur in long-context scenarios involving LLMs \\cite{zhang2023k1j}. It also notes the ongoing debate regarding the classification of unverifiable content as hallucination \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n    *   **Scope of applicability:**\n        The survey focuses on hallucination specifically within the context of Large Language Models, addressing challenges arising from their scale, versatility, and training paradigms \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.

        "abstract": "The prevalent use of large language models (LLMs) in various domains has drawn attention to the issue of\"hallucination,\"which refers to instances where LLMs generate factually inaccurate or ungrounded information. Existing techniques for hallucination detection in language assistants rely on intricate fuzzy, specific free-language-based chain of thought (CoT) techniques or parameter-based methods that suffer from interpretability issues. Additionally, the methods that identify hallucinations post-generation could not prevent their occurrence and suffer from inconsistent performance due to the influence of the instruction format and model style. In this paper, we introduce a novel pre-detection self-evaluation technique, referred to as SELF-FAMILIARITY, which focuses on evaluating the model's familiarity with the concepts present in the input instruction and withholding the generation of response in case of unfamiliar concepts. This approach emulates the human ability to refrain from responding to unfamiliar topics, thus reducing hallucinations.

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   The paper addresses the critical issue of \"hallucination\" in Large Language Models (LLMs), where models generate factually inaccurate or ungrounded information \\cite{luo2023xyc}.\n    *   This problem is important because it significantly hinders LLMs' reliability and trustworthiness, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare.\n    *   It is challenging because existing methods primarily focus on *post-detection* of hallucinations, lacking the ability to *prevent* their occurrence. These methods also suffer from interpretability issues, inconsistent performance due to instruction format and model style, and often rely on external knowledge bases or strong inference abilities from the LLM itself \\cite{luo2023xyc}. A proactive, preventative, and zero-resource strategy is needed.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   Existing approaches for hallucination detection and correction in open conversations fall into two main categories:\n        *   **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) or prompt programming methods**: These evaluate and amend responses, sometimes with external knowledge bases. Limitations include being engineered for specific responses, high dependence on the model's inner inference ability, and ambiguous classification thresholds due to free-text outputs \\cite{luo2023xyc}.\n        *   **Parameter-based methods**: These use metrics like token probability or perplexity to determine hallucination levels. While offering better generalization and precise scores, they often reduce interpretability and may be limited to specific domains (e.g., biography-related issues for Self-check GPT) \\cite{luo2023xyc}.\n    *   All these methods are primarily *post-detection*, meaning they identify hallucinations after generation, rather than preventing them. They also often rely on external knowledge or are sensitive to instruction/model styles.\n    *   This work positions `SELF-FAMILIARITY` \\cite{luo2023xyc} as a novel *pre-detection*, *zero-resource* method that analyzes the input instruction itself to prevent hallucinations, distinguishing it from prior art.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   The core technical method is `SELF-FAMILIARITY` \\cite{luo2023xyc}, a pre-detection self-evaluation technique that mimics human self-assessment by evaluating the LLM's familiarity with concepts in the input instruction. If unfamiliar concepts are detected, the model refrains from generating a response.\n    *   The approach consists of three main stages:\n        1.  **Concept Extraction**: Uses a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to extract key concept entities from the input instruction. It refines these by \"Concept Grouping\" (fusing adjacent concepts) and \"Concept Filtering\" (removing common concepts using Wiktionary) to reduce noise and improve efficiency \\cite{luo2023xyc}.\n        2.  **Concept Guessing**: For each extracted concept, the model performs a self-evaluation to determine its familiarity. This involves:\n            *   **Concept Explanation**: The LLM generates an explanation for the concept using greedy search. To prevent \"cheating,\" the original concept's words are masked within the generated explanation \\cite{luo2023xyc}.\n            *   **Concept Inference**: Using the masked explanation, the LLM is prompted to regenerate the original concept. Constrained beam search is employed to ensure the original concept is sought, and the highest probability score of the successful regeneration is taken as the \"familiarity score\" for that concept \\cite{luo2023xyc}.\n        3.  **Aggregation**: Combines individual concept familiarity scores into a single instruction-level familiarity score. This involves calculating a \"Concept Frequency Score\" (based on word frequency ranks from Wiktionary) to weigh the importance of each concept, followed by a \"Weighted Aggregation\" using a geometrically decreasing scheme. If the final score falls below a predetermined threshold, the response generation is withheld \\cite{luo2023xyc}.\n    *   This approach is novel because it is proactive (pre-detection), zero-resource (no external knowledge base needed), and uses prompt engineering to derive a quantitative familiarity score without requiring strong inference abilities or producing ambiguous free-text outputs \\cite{luo2023xyc}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithm/Method**: Introduction of `SELF-FAMILIARITY` \\cite{luo2023xyc}, a pre-detection self-evaluation framework for hallucination prevention in LLMs.\n    *   **Innovative Techniques**:\n        *   A multi-stage concept processing pipeline (NER, grouping, filtering) for robust concept extraction from free-text instructions.\n        *   The \"Concept Guessing\" mechanism, which uses a two-step prompt engineering process (explanation generation with masking, followed by constrained beam search for inference) to quantitatively assess an LLM's familiarity with a concept.\n        *   A weighted aggregation scheme for instruction-level familiarity, incorporating concept importance via frequency scores.\n    *   **System Design**: A zero-resource approach that operates solely on the LLM's intrinsic knowledge, enhancing universality and applicability \\cite{luo2023xyc}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insight**: Emulation of human self-assessment to refrain from responding to unfamiliar topics, providing a more intuitive and interpretable mechanism for hallucination mitigation.\n    *   **Dataset Contribution**: Introduction of the Concept-7 dataset, specifically designed for validating pre-detection hallucinatory instruction classification, addressing a gap in existing post-detection datasets \\cite{luo2023xyc}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   The `SELF-FAMILIARITY` method \\cite{luo2023xyc} was validated across four different large language models.\n    *   Experiments were conducted using a newly proposed dataset, Concept-7, which focuses on the classification of potential hallucinatory instructions.\n    *   The results consistently demonstrated superior performance of `SELF-FAMILIARITY` \\cite{luo2023xyc} compared to existing techniques across all tested models.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**: While the paper highlights its strengths, the effectiveness of `SELF-FAMILIARITY` \\cite{luo2023xyc} relies on the accuracy of the initial NER model for concept extraction and the robustness of the prompt engineering for concept explanation and inference. The paper addresses some of these (grouping, filtering, masking), but these remain dependencies. The final threshold `h` for withholding responses needs to be predetermined, which might require careful tuning.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The method is designed for a *zero-resource* environment and targets *pre-detection* of hallucinations in *open conversation* settings, making it broadly applicable where external knowledge bases are unavailable or real-time prevention is crucial \\cite{luo2023xyc}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   This work represents a significant advancement by shifting the paradigm from post-detection to *preemptive prevention* of LLM hallucinations \\cite{luo2023xyc}.\n    *   It enhances the reliability, applicability, and interpretability of LLM assistants by enabling them to \"know what they don't know\" and refrain from generating potentially inaccurate information.\n    *   The zero-resource nature and robustness against instruction/model styles make it highly practical for diverse real-world applications. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the trustworthiness and utility of LLMs in critical domains \\cite{luo2023xyc}.",

        "abstract": "Hallucination, posed as a pervasive challenge of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), has significantly impeded their real-world usage that demands precise judgment. Existing methods mitigate this issue with either training with specific designed data or inferencing with external knowledge from other sources, incurring inevitable additional costs. In this paper, we present OPERA, a novel MLLM decoding method grounded in an Over-trust Penalty and a Retrospection-Allocation strategy, serving as a nearly free lunch to alleviate the hallucination issue without additional data, knowledge, or training. Our approach begins with an interesting observation that, most hallucinations are closely tied to the knowledge aggregation patterns manifested in the self-attention matrix, i.e., MLLMs tend to generate new tokens by focusing on a few summary tokens, but not all the previous tokens. Such partial overtrust inclination results in the neglecting of image tokens and describes the image content with hallucination. Based on the observation, OPERA introduces a penalty term on the model logits during the beam-search decoding to mitigate the over-trust issue, along with a rollback strategy that retrospects the presence of summary tokens in the previously generated tokens, and re-allocate the token selection if necessary. With extensive experiments, OPERA shows significant hallucination-mitigating performance on different MLLMs and metrics, proving its effectiveness and generality.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit hallucinations in long-form question-answering tasks across various domains and wide applications. Current hallucination detection and mitigation datasets are limited in domains and sizes, which struggle to scale due to prohibitive labor costs and insufficient reliability of existing hallucination annotators. To facilitate the scalable oversight of LLM hallucinations, this paper introduces an iterative self-training framework that simultaneously and progressively scales up the hallucination annotation dataset and improves the accuracy of the hallucination annotator. Based on the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, in each iteration, the framework first applies a hallucination annotation pipeline to annotate a scaled dataset and then trains a more accurate hallucination annotator on the dataset. This new hallucination annotator is adopted in the hallucination annotation pipeline used for the next iteration. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the finally obtained hallucination annotator with only 7B parameters surpasses the performance of GPT-4 and obtains new state-of-the-art hallucination detection results on HaluEval and HalluQA by zero-shot inference. Such an annotator can not only evaluate the hallucination levels of various LLMs on the large-scale dataset but also help to mitigate the hallucination of LLMs generations, with the Natural Language Inference (NLI) metric increasing from 25% to 37% on HaluEval.",

        "abstract": "Despite the outstanding performance in vision-language reasoning, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) might generate hallucinated contents that do not exist in the given image. Most existing LVLM hallucination benchmarks are constrained to evaluate the object-related hallucinations. However, the potential hallucination on the relations between two objects, i.e., relation hallucination, still lacks investigation. To remedy that, we design a unified framework to measure the object and relation hallucination in LVLMs simultaneously. The core idea of our framework is to evaluate hallucinations via (object, relation, object) triplets extracted from LVLMs'responses, making it easily generalizable to different vision-language tasks. Based on our framework, we further introduce Tri-HE, a novel Triplet-level Hallucination Evaluation benchmark which can be used to study both object and relation hallucination at the same time. With comprehensive evaluations on Tri-HE, we observe that the relation hallucination issue is even more serious than object hallucination among existing LVLMs, highlighting a previously neglected problem towards reliable LVLMs. Moreover, based on our findings, we design a simple training-free approach that effectively mitigates hallucinations for LVLMs. Our dataset and code for the reproduction of our experiments are available publicly at https://github.com/wujunjie1998/Tri-HE.",

THaMES offers an end-to-end solution for evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in LLMs, featuring automated test set generation, multifaceted benchmarking, and adaptable mitigation strategies.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented performances in various applications, yet evaluating them is still challenging. Existing benchmarks are either manually constructed or are automatic, but lack the ability to evaluate the thought process of LLMs with arbitrary complexity. We contend that utilizing existing relational databases based on the entity-relationship (ER) model is a promising approach for constructing benchmarks as they contain structured knowledge that can be used to question LLMs. Unlike knowledge graphs, which are also used to evaluate LLMs, relational databases have integrity constraints that can be used to better construct complex in-depth questions and verify answers: (1) functional dependencies can be used to pinpoint critical keywords that an LLM must know to properly answer a given question containing certain attribute values; and (2) foreign key constraints can be used to join relations and construct multi-hop questions, which can be arbitrarily long and used to debug intermediate answers. We thus propose ERBench, which uses these integrity constraints to convert any database into an LLM benchmark. ERBench supports continuous evaluation as databases change, multimodal questions, and various prompt engineering techniques. In our experiments, we construct LLM benchmarks using databases of multiple domains and make an extensive comparison of contemporary LLMs. We show how ERBench can properly evaluate any LLM by not only checking for answer correctness, but also effectively verifying the rationales by looking for the right keywords.",

        "title": "Towards Trustable Language Models: Investigating Information Quality of Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "Large language models (LLM) are generating information at a rapid pace, requiring users to increasingly rely and trust the data. Despite remarkable advances of LLM, Information generated by LLM is not completely trustworthy, due to challenges in information quality. Specifically, integrity of Information quality decreases due to unreliable, biased, tokenization during pre-training of LLM. Moreover, due to decreased information quality issues, has led towards hallucination, fabricated information. Unreliable information can lead towards flawed decisions in businesses, which impacts economic activity. In this work, we introduce novel mathematical information quality evaluation of LLM, we furthermore analyze and highlight information quality challenges, scaling laws to systematically scale language models.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n### Focused Summary for Literature Review\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the critical issue of declining information quality (IQ) and lack of trustworthiness in content generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) \\cite{rejeleene2024okw}.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: Information from LLMs is often unreliable, biased, and prone to hallucinations or fabricated content, stemming from issues in pre-training processes like tokenization and data quality \\cite{rejeleene2024okw}. This problem is crucial because unreliable LLM outputs can lead to flawed decisions in vital sectors (e.g., business, medicine, law), eroding user trust and negatively impacting economic activity and societal development \\cite{rejeleene2024okw}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: The work reviews the landscape of state-of-the-art LLMs, including Transformer-based architectures like BERT, GPT series (GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-4), and Llama/Llama 2, acknowledging their impressive capabilities and scaling trends \\cite{rejeleene2024okw}. It also discusses various tokenization methods and benchmark datasets used in NLP \\cite{rejeleene2024okw}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: While existing LLMs excel in performance and scale, the paper implicitly positions its work by highlighting that current research and evaluation metrics often overlook a systematic and explicit framework for assessing the *information quality* of LLM outputs \\cite{rejeleene2024okw}. This gap leads to persistent issues like factual incorrectness, bias, and hallucination, which are not adequately captured or addressed by traditional performance metrics alone \\cite{rejeleene2024okw}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper introduces a novel mathematical formulation for evaluating the Information Quality (IQ) of LLM-generated information \\cite{rejeleene2024okw}. This formulation defines IQ as a function of three key dimensions: consistency, relevance, and accuracy \\cite{rejeleene2024okw}.\n    *   **Novelty**: The proposed IQ model is a linear weighted combination: `IQ(L) = f((w1 * consistency * w2 * relevance * w3 * accuracy) / sum(w1 to w3))`, where `sum(w1 to w3) = 1` and `w1, w2, w3` are context-specific weights \\cite{rejeleene2024okw}. This approach is innovative due to its simplicity, tunability, normalization, and domain-agnostic nature, explicitly designed to align with human expectations and LLM alignment goals, offering a systematic pipeline for IQ evaluation in NLP \\cite{rejeleene2024okw}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**: A new mathematical formulation for Information Quality (IQ) evaluation in LLMs, based on a weighted combination of consistency, relevance, and accuracy \\cite{rejeleene2024okw}.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: While not a system design in the traditional sense, the paper proposes a conceptual pipeline for integrating IQ evaluation into LLM development and deployment \\cite{rejeleene2024okw}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: A comprehensive analysis of the root causes of poor information quality in LLMs, including the impact of tokenization methods, lack of data diversity, inherent biases in training data, and the implications of scaling laws on quality \\cite{rejeleene2024okw}. The paper also discusses the economic significance of trustworthy LLM outputs \\cite{rejeleene2024okw}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: The paper primarily presents a conceptual framework and an analytical discussion of information quality challenges in LLMs. It *does not* present direct empirical experiments or validation of its proposed mathematical `IQ(L)` model with actual LLM outputs \\cite{rejeleene2024okw}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**: The paper references existing LLM performance metrics (e.g., perplexity, BLEU score) and discusses how poor data quality (e.g., SBNATION data leading to low BLEU scores) impacts these, but these are not results from new experiments conducted to validate their IQ metric \\cite{rejeleene2024okw}. A comparison table of state-of-the-art LLMs (BERT, GPT3, BART, ChatGPT, Llama2) is provided to contextualize the discussion on scaling and data quality, detailing their parameters, training data, and general performance, but this serves as background rather than direct validation of the proposed IQ framework \\cite{rejeleene2024okw}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**:\n        *   LLMs are inherently limited by the quality, diversity, and bias present in their massive training datasets \\cite{rejeleene2024okw}.\n        *   Current tokenization methods can introduce information loss, \"token's glitching,\" and increased computational costs, affecting output quality \\cite{rejeleene2024okw}.\n        *   LLMs frequently exhibit hallucinations, factual inaccuracies, and inconsistencies, especially in complex reasoning or multimodal contexts (e.g., GPT-4V) \\cite{rejeleene2024okw}.\n        *   The computational cost and energy consumption associated with scaling LLMs pose challenges for simultaneously optimizing quality and efficiency \\cite{rejeleene2024okw}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The proposed IQ evaluation framework is designed to be domain-agnostic, aiming for broad applicability across various LLM applications where trust and reliability are critical \\cite{rejeleene2024okw}. However, the practical implementation and fine-tuning of the context-specific weights (`w1, w2, w3`) would require domain expertise \\cite{rejeleene2024okw}.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: This work significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by proposing a structured, mathematical framework for evaluating *information quality* in LLM outputs, moving beyond traditional performance metrics \\cite{rejeleene2024okw}. This is crucial for the trustworthy deployment and adoption of LLMs in sensitive applications \\cite{rejeleene2024okw}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: By systematically analyzing and highlighting the technical challenges related to data quality, tokenization, bias, and scaling that undermine LLM trustworthiness, the paper provides clear and actionable directions for future research aimed at improving LLM reliability, reducing hallucinations, and fostering more transparent and accountable AI systems \\cite{rejeleene2024okw}.",

        "abstract": "Generation of plausible but incorrect factual information, often termed hallucination, has attracted significant research interest. Retrieval-augmented language model (RALM) -- which enhances models with up-to-date knowledge -- emerges as a promising method to reduce hallucination. However, existing RALMs may instead exacerbate hallucination when retrieving lengthy contexts. To address this challenge, we propose COFT, a novel \\textbf{CO}arse-to-\\textbf{F}ine highligh\\textbf{T}ing method to focus on different granularity-level key texts, thereby avoiding getting lost in lengthy contexts. Specifically, COFT consists of three components: \\textit{recaller}, \\textit{scorer}, and \\textit{selector}. First, \\textit{recaller} applies a knowledge graph to extract potential key entities in a given context. Second, \\textit{scorer} measures the importance of each entity by calculating its contextual weight. Finally, \\textit{selector} selects high contextual weight entities with a dynamic threshold algorithm and highlights the corresponding paragraphs, sentences, or words in a coarse-to-fine manner. Extensive experiments on the knowledge hallucination benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of COFT, leading to a superior performance over $30\\%$ in the F1 score metric. Moreover, COFT also exhibits remarkable versatility across various long-form tasks, such as reading comprehension and question answering.",

While RALMs are promising for integrating up-to-date knowledge, they face two key challenges: (1) lack of complete contextual semantics when only retrieving short snippets, and (2) \"getting lost in long contexts\" when retrieving entire documents, as irrelevant texts distract the LLM's reasoning, even for models designed for long inputs. `\\cite{lv2024k5x}` aims to address this by preserving complete contextual semantics while being robust to long, potentially noisy contexts.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: `\\cite{lv2024k5x}` builds upon and aims to improve Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) and implicitly complements Chain-of-X approaches (e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Chain-of-Verification) by providing more focused and relevant input.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   **RALMs**: Existing RALMs can exacerbate hallucination when retrieving lengthy contexts due to the presence of irrelevant information.

A comprehensive and fine-grained measurement of the hallucination is the first key step for the governance of this issue but is under-explored in the community. Thus, we present $\\textbf{ANAH}$, a bilingual dataset that offers $\\textbf{AN}$alytical $\\textbf{A}$nnotation of $\\textbf{H}$allucinations in LLMs within Generative Question Answering. Each answer sentence in our dataset undergoes rigorous annotation, involving the retrieval of a reference fragment, the judgment of the hallucination type, and the correction of hallucinated content. ANAH consists of ~12k sentence-level annotations for ~4.3k LLM responses covering over 700 topics, constructed by a human-in-the-loop pipeline. Thanks to the fine granularity of the hallucination annotations, we can quantitatively confirm that the hallucinations of LLMs progressively accumulate in the answer and use ANAH to train and evaluate hallucination annotators. We conduct extensive experiments on studying generative and discriminative annotators and show that, although current open-source LLMs have difficulties in fine-grained hallucination annotation, the generative annotator trained with ANAH can surpass all open-source LLMs and GPT-3.5, obtain performance competitive with GPT-4, and exhibits better generalization ability on unseen questions.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \"\\cite{ji20243j6}\" for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the critical need for comprehensive and fine-grained measurement of hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in generative question answering.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: Hallucinations significantly hinder the wide application of LLMs. Their fluent and convincing nature makes detection difficult, impeding deep analysis and effective mitigation. Existing benchmarks are often coarse-grained (only indicating if an entire response contains hallucinations) or outdated, failing to provide the detailed insights required to trace triggers and develop targeted solutions.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: The work acknowledges prior efforts in detecting and evaluating hallucination.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Most benchmarks were developed before the advent of modern LLMs and targeted specific English tasks, making them less challenging for current models. More recent LLM benchmarks typically offer only coarse-grained categorization of hallucination at the entire response level, lacking explanations or references, which prevents tracing the exact triggers and obstructs further mitigation efforts.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper introduces ANAH (ANalytical Annotation of Hallucinations), a novel, large-scale, bilingual (Chinese-English) dataset designed for sentence-level, analytical annotation of LLM hallucinations in knowledge-based generative question answering.\n    *   **Novelty**: The core innovation lies in its fine-grained annotation process for *each sentence* in an LLM-generated answer. This process involves:\n        1.  Retrieving a specific reference fragment from source documents.\n        2.  Judging the hallucination type (No Hallucination, Contradictory Hallucination, Unverifiable Hallucination, or No Fact).\n        3.  Providing a correction for hallucinated content based on the reference.\n    *   **Human-in-the-loop Pipeline**: A key aspect of its construction is a human-in-the-loop pipeline that leverages GPT-4 for preliminary annotation, followed by rigorous human verification and refinement to ensure accuracy and scalability.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Dataset (ANAH)**: Creation of ANAH, comprising approximately 12k sentence-level annotations across 4.3k LLM responses covering over 700 topics, providing an unprecedented level of detail for hallucination analysis.\n    *   **Fine-grained Annotation Methodology**: Development of a structured, multi-step annotation scheme that moves beyond simple detection to analytical understanding of hallucination types and their specific locations within generated text.\n    *   **Quantitative Confirmation of Hallucination Accumulation**: Using the fine granularity of ANAH, the authors quantitatively confirm that hallucinations progressively accumulate in LLM responses, providing empirical evidence for the \"snowball effect.\"\n    *   **Enabling Training of Hallucination Annotators**: ANAH serves as a robust dataset for training and evaluating both generative and discriminative models specifically designed to annotate LLM hallucinations.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**:\n        *   Verification of GPT-4's annotation quality by comparing its output with human annotations.\n        *   Analysis of hallucination proportions in answers generated by LLMs with and without reference documents.\n        *   Quantitative analysis of the hallucination accumulation effect across sentences.\n        *   Extensive experiments on training and evaluating generative and discriminative hallucination annotators using ANAH.\n        *   Comparison of trained annotators against various open-source LLMs and proprietary models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Results**:\n        *   GPT-4 showed high consistency with human annotations: 86.97% for hallucination type, 85.37% for reference, and 78.98% for correction.\n        *   The probability of hallucination in a sentence given previous hallucinations (P(Ht|H[0:t−1])) was significantly higher (58.51% for English, 52.54% for Chinese) than the overall hallucination probability, confirming the accumulation effect.\n        *   A generative annotator trained with ANAH achieved 81.01% accuracy, outperforming all tested open-source LLMs and GPT-3.5, and demonstrating competitive performance with GPT-4 (86.97%) while exhibiting better generalization on unseen questions.\n        *   Generative annotators were found to be superior to discriminative annotators in handling the imbalance of hallucination types.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**: GPT-4, while effective, showed a tendency to misclassify sentences with referential ambiguity or summary discussion as 'No Fact', though this category represents a small proportion of the dataset.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The dataset and analysis are primarily focused on knowledge-based generative question answering and cover specific domains and topics curated during the dataset construction.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: ANAH significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing the first comprehensive, fine-grained, and bilingual benchmark for analytical hallucination annotation, moving beyond superficial detection.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n        *   Enables deeper, more nuanced understanding of LLM hallucination mechanisms, such as the confirmed accumulation effect.\n        *   Provides a crucial resource for developing and rigorously evaluating advanced hallucination detection, explanation, and mitigation techniques.\n        *   Offers a pathway to create smaller, more cost-effective hallucination annotators that can rival the performance of large proprietary models like GPT-4.\n        *   Guides future data collection efforts by suggesting that prioritizing broader topic coverage is more beneficial for generalization than simply increasing the number of questions within existing topics.",

        "title": "A Comprehensive Survey of Hallucination Mitigation Techniques in Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance in their ability to write human-like text, a key challenge remains around their tendency to hallucinate generating content that appears factual but is ungrounded. This issue of hallucination is arguably the biggest hindrance to safely deploying these powerful LLMs into real-world production systems that impact people's lives. The journey toward widespread adoption of LLMs in practical settings heavily relies on addressing and mitigating hallucinations. Unlike traditional AI systems focused on limited tasks, LLMs have been exposed to vast amounts of online text data during training. While this allows them to display impressive language fluency, it also means they are capable of extrapolating information from the biases in training data, misinterpreting ambiguous prompts, or modifying the information to align superficially with the input. This becomes hugely alarming when we rely on language generation capabilities for sensitive applications, such as summarizing medical records, financial analysis reports, etc. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of over 32 techniques developed to mitigate hallucination in LLMs. Notable among these are Retrieval Augmented Generation (Lewis et al, 2021), Knowledge Retrieval (Varshney et al,2023), CoNLI (Lei et al, 2023), and CoVe (Dhuliawala et al, 2023). Furthermore, we introduce a detailed taxonomy categorizing these methods based on various parameters, such as dataset utilization, common tasks, feedback mechanisms, and retriever types. This classification helps distinguish the diverse approaches specifically designed to tackle hallucination issues in LLMs. Additionally, we analyze the challenges and limitations inherent in these techniques, providing a solid foundation for future research in addressing hallucinations and related phenomena within the realm of LLMs.",

        "abstract": "In the era of large language models (LLMs), hallucination (i.e., the tendency to generate factually incorrect content) poses great challenge to trustworthy and reliable deployment of LLMs in real-world applications. To tackle the LLM hallucination, three key questions should be well studied: how to detect hallucinations (detection), why do LLMs hallucinate (source), and what can be done to mitigate them (mitigation). To address these challenges, this work presents a systematic empirical study on LLM hallucination, focused on the the three aspects of hallucination detection, source and mitigation. Specially, we construct a new hallucination benchmark HaluEval 2.0, and designs a simple yet effective detection method for LLM hallucination. Furthermore, we zoom into the different training or utilization stages of LLMs and extensively analyze the potential factors that lead to the LLM hallucination. Finally, we implement and examine a series of widely used techniques to mitigate the hallucinations in LLMs. Our work has led to several important findings to understand the hallucination origin and mitigate the hallucinations in LLMs. Our code and data can be accessed at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/HaluEval-2.0.",

Yet, these models are often plagued by\"hallucinations\", where irrelevant or nonsensical content is generated, deviating from the actual video context. This work introduces VideoHallucer, the first comprehensive benchmark for hallucination detection in large video-language models (LVLMs). VideoHallucer categorizes hallucinations into two main types: intrinsic and extrinsic, offering further subcategories for detailed analysis, including object-relation, temporal, semantic detail, extrinsic factual, and extrinsic non-factual hallucinations. We adopt an adversarial binary VideoQA method for comprehensive evaluation, where pairs of basic and hallucinated questions are crafted strategically. By evaluating eleven LVLMs on VideoHallucer, we reveal that i) the majority of current models exhibit significant issues with hallucinations; ii) while scaling datasets and parameters improves models' ability to detect basic visual cues and counterfactuals, it provides limited benefit for detecting extrinsic factual hallucinations; iii) existing models are more adept at detecting facts than identifying hallucinations.

They also do not adequately address dynamic content, temporal reasoning, or the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic factual inconsistencies in video.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: `\\cite{wang2024rta}` introduces **VideoHallucer**, the first comprehensive benchmark for hallucination detection in LVLMs. It employs an **adversarial binary VideoQA method**, where each datapoint consists of a \"basic question\" (to test LVLM's fundamental understanding) and a strategically crafted \"hallucinated question\" (to evaluate hallucination detection).\n    *   **Novelty**:\n        *   **Comprehensive Taxonomy**: `VideoHallucer` establishes a novel and detailed taxonomy of hallucinations for LVLMs, categorizing them into:\n            *   **Intrinsic Hallucinations**: Content directly contradicting the video (Object-Relation, Temporal, Semantic Detail).\n            *   **Extrinsic Hallucinations**: Content not verifiable from the video (Extrinsic Factual, Extrinsic Non-factual).\n        *   **Video-Specific Evaluation**: It specifically addresses dynamic content, temporal reasoning, and semantic details within videos, which are largely overlooked by image-based benchmarks.\n        *   **Adversarial Paired Questions**: The use of paired basic and hallucinated questions in a binary VQA format provides a robust and rigorous evaluation, minimizing language biases by balancing 'yes'/'no' responses and providing explanations for clarity.\n        *   **Self-PEP Framework**: A plug-and-play framework designed to enhance models' self-improvement capabilities in hallucination resistance by integrating explanatory processes.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**:\n        *   The **VideoHallucer benchmark** itself, with its structured dataset construction for five distinct hallucination types (Object-Relation, Temporal, Semantic Detail, Extrinsic Factual, Extrinsic Non-factual).\n        *   The **adversarial binary VideoQA evaluation method** for robust hallucination detection.\n        *   The **Self-PEP (Self-Prompting with Explanations for Performance)** framework, a post-hoc method to improve hallucination resistance.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: The proposed **taxonomy of intrinsic and extrinsic hallucinations** with their subcategories provides a structured way to analyze and understand different types of LVLM failures.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: The paper provides empirical insights into the nature of hallucinations in LVLMs, particularly regarding the limitations of scaling for extrinsic factual hallucinations and the disparity between fact recognition and hallucination detection.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: `\\cite{wang2024rta}` comprehensively evaluated eleven state-of-the-art LVLMs on the `VideoHallucer` benchmark. Additionally, the Self-PEP framework was applied to these models to demonstrate its effectiveness.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   **Widespread Hallucinations**: Revealed significant hallucination issues across the majority of current LVLMs, with substantial performance gaps between human and model capabilities in all `VideoHallucer` settings.\n        *   **Scaling Limitations**: While scaling datasets and parameters improved detection of basic visual cues and counterfactuals, it showed *limited benefit* for detecting extrinsic factual hallucinations.\n        *   **Fact vs. Hallucination Detection**: Current models are more proficient at recognizing facts than at identifying hallucinations, which requires discerning facts within the source context.\n        *   **Self-PEP Effectiveness**: The Self-PEP framework achieved an average of **5.38% improvement** in hallucination resistance across various model architectures, demonstrating its practical utility.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The benchmark focuses on hallucination detection via a binary VQA format, which might not cover all forms of generative hallucinations (e.g., in open-ended video captioning or summarization). The construction relies on semi-automated and human annotation, which can introduce biases, though efforts were made to mitigate this.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: `VideoHallucer` is specifically designed for evaluating hallucination detection in Large Video-Language Models (LVLMs) and provides a framework for understanding and mitigating these issues. Its direct applicability is primarily for VQA-based hallucination assessment.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: `\\cite{wang2024rta}` significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing the *first comprehensive benchmark* specifically tailored for hallucination detection in LVLMs, moving beyond static image-based evaluations.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n        *   Offers a standardized and rigorous tool (`VideoHallucer`) for evaluating and comparing future LVLMs' robustness against hallucinations.\n        *   The detailed taxonomy provides a conceptual framework for researchers to categorize and target specific types of hallucinations.\n        *   The empirical insights (e.g., scaling limitations for extrinsic factual hallucinations) highlight critical areas for future model development.\n        *   The Self-PEP framework offers a practical, plug-and-play method for improving hallucination resistance, encouraging further research into explainability-driven model self-improvement.",

writing, and increasing test-time compute.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Results:**\n        *   **LLM Performance:** Top-performing LLMs (e.g., Claude-3.5-sonnet, GPT-4o) struggle significantly with larger and more complex graph problems, particularly NP-complete tasks, exhibiting high hallucination rates (e.g., up to 40.7% for GPT-4o-mini on large polynomial tasks).\n        *   **Task Difficulty:** LLMs perform significantly better on polynomial-time tasks (direct algorithmic reasoning) than on NP-complete tasks (meta-algorithmic planning), where they often default to greedy algorithms.\n        *   **Graph Size Impact:** Performance degrades substantially as graph size increases, with hallucination rates rising.\n        *   **Improvement Strategies:**\n

Limitations/Assumptions:**\n        *   The benchmark focuses on specific graph computational problems and does not cover all possible graph-related reasoning tasks (e.g., graph generation, graph representation learning).\n        *   The problem encoding into text can result in long contexts (up to 6,000 tokens), which itself poses a challenge for LLMs, potentially conflating long-context understanding with graph reasoning.\n        *   The study conducted a single run per model due to computational demands, which might not capture the full variability of LLM responses.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** GraphArena is primarily applicable for evaluating LLMs' algorithmic reasoning and planning capabilities on discrete graph structures, particularly for problems requiring systematic traversal, search, and optimization. It highlights LLMs' current limitations in handling complex, large-scale graph computations and their tendency to hallucinate infeasible solutions.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** GraphArena significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in LLM evaluation by providing a more realistic, comprehensive, and rigorously evaluated benchmark for graph computational problems. It moves beyond superficial evaluations to probe genuine reasoning and planning abilities.\n    *   **Identification of Key Weaknesses:** The benchmark clearly identifies critical weaknesses in current LLMs, such as their struggle with meta-algorithmic planning, high hallucination rates on complex tasks, and sensitivity to graph size, even for top-tier models.\n    *   **Guidance for Future Research:** The exploration of improvement strategies offers concrete directions for future research, highlighting the potential of code generation and the limitations of simpler prompting techniques and instruction tuning for complex graph reasoning. It also suggests LLMs could serve as alternative heuristics for NP tasks, complementing existing approximation methods.\n    *   **Open-Source Contribution:** The open-sourcing of GraphArena (problems, responses, and codebase) provides a valuable resource for the research community to foster reproducible and comparable advancements in LLM graph reasoning.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to hallucinate, whereby they generate plausible but inaccurate text. This phenomenon poses significant risks in critical applications, such as medicine or law, necessitating robust hallucination mitigation strategies. While recent works have proposed fine-tuning methods to teach LLMs to abstain from answering questions beyond their knowledge or capabilities, these methods rely on the existence of ground-truth labels or are limited to short-form responses. To address these limitations, we propose fine-tuning using semantic entropy, an uncertainty measure derived from introspection into the model which does not require external labels. We demonstrate that our approach matches or outperforms models fine-tuned using prior work and achieves strong performance for both short and long-form generations on a range of datasets.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination (generating plausible but inaccurate text), which poses significant risks in critical applications (e.g., medicine, law). While fine-tuning LLMs to abstain from answering questions beyond their knowledge is a promising mitigation strategy, existing methods suffer from two key limitations:\n        1.  They often rely on the availability of ground-truth labels, which are difficult or costly to obtain and can be noisy.\n        2.  They are typically limited to short-form responses, failing to account for the lexical and syntactical variations inherent in longer generations.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge:** Mitigating hallucinations is crucial for ensuring the safety, trustworthiness, and overall reliability of LLMs, especially as they are increasingly deployed in high-stakes real-world scenarios. Developing a label-free and versatile abstention mechanism applicable to diverse generation lengths is a significant challenge.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** This work builds upon existing hallucination mitigation strategies, particularly those involving uncertainty estimation and abstention fine-tuning. It specifically improves upon uncertainty-based fine-tuning methods like R-Tuning-U \\cite{zhang2024r} by addressing its limitations.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n        *   Many abstention fine-tuning methods (e.g., R-Tuning \\cite{zhang2024r}, \\cite{yang2023teaching}, \\cite{cheng2024uncertainty}, \\cite{wolfe2024abstain}) require ground-truth labels, making them resource-intensive and potentially susceptible to label noise.\n        *   Uncertainty-based methods like R-Tuning-U \\cite{zhang2024r} use classical entropy, which is sensitive to minor lexical and syntactical variations, thereby limiting its applicability to only short-form responses and hindering its usefulness for more complex, free-form generations.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper proposes a fine-tuning strategy that leverages *semantic entropy* to enable LLMs to appropriately abstain from answering questions when uncertain \\cite{tjandra2024umq}. This approach is label-free and robust to variations in generation length.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:**\n        *   **Semantic Entropy for Abstention:** Unlike R-Tuning-U which uses classical entropy over raw token sequences, \\cite{tjandra2024umq} computes entropy over the *semantic space* of model generations. This makes the uncertainty measure robust to lexical and syntactical variations, allowing it to accurately indicate hallucinations in both short-form and long-form generations. Semantic equivalence is operationalized using question-dependent bi-directional entailment to cluster responses.\n        *   **Label-Free Fine-Tuning:** The method constructs a training dataset by partitioning questions based on their computed semantic entropy. High-entropy questions are assigned an \"abstain\" label (\"I don't know the answer.\"), while low-entropy questions retain the model's standard response. The model is then fine-tuned using supervised learning with cross-entropy loss.\n        *   **Accuracy-Engagement Distance (AED):** A novel evaluation metric is introduced \\cite{tjandra2024umq} that holistically quantifies model hallucination by considering both accuracy and *engagement* (the number of questions a model willingly answers). AED is a normalized Euclidean distance from an ideal model (max accuracy, max engagement), penalizing models that abstain too frequently or inaccurately.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithm/Method:** A novel fine-tuning approach for LLMs that enables abstention based on *semantic entropy*, providing a label-free and robust mechanism for hallucination mitigation applicable to both short-form and long-form generations \\cite{tjandra2024umq}.\n    *   **Novel Evaluation Metric:** The introduction of the Accuracy-Engagement Distance (AED) \\cite{tjandra2024umq}, a more comprehensive metric for evaluating abstention-capable models by balancing accuracy with the willingness to answer.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** The proposed method was evaluated on LLAMA-3-8B-INSTRUCT across four datasets (TriviaQA, BioASQ, NQ, SQuAD) in a closed-book setting. Experiments covered two answering settings: Long-QA (free-form) and Short-QA (short answers). The method was compared against R-Tuning (label-dependent) and R-Tuning-U (label-independent, classical entropy) \\cite{zhang2024r}. Semantic entropy was computed using two different entailment models (DeBERTa and Llama-3-70B-Instruct).\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results:**\n        *   The method using semantic entropy (SE) matched or outperformed models fine-tuned with R-Tuning and R-Tuning-U \\cite{tjandra2024umq}.\n        *   It achieved a significant reduction in hallucination rates: up to **30.1% for long-form generations** and up to **8.7% for short-form generations** compared to R-Tuning and R-Tuning-U.\n        *   The AED metric effectively demonstrated the improved balance between accuracy and engagement of the proposed method, penalizing models with low engagement that would otherwise appear equivalent based solely on accuracy.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The effectiveness of semantic entropy relies on the quality and contextual understanding of the underlying entailment model used for semantic clustering. The uncertainty threshold (τ) for partitioning the dataset is a user-defined hyperparameter. Due to resource constraints, LoRA was used for fine-tuning, which might not capture the full potential of full fine-tuning.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The method is demonstrated for factual QA tasks in a closed-book setting. Its label-free nature makes it highly scalable and applicable to a wide range of tasks requiring uncertainty-aware abstention, for both short and long-form text generation.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** This work significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in hallucination mitigation by providing a robust, label-free, and versatile fine-tuning approach for LLM abstention \\cite{tjandra2024umq}. It successfully addresses the critical limitations of prior methods, particularly their reliance on ground-truth labels and restriction to short-form responses.\n    *   **Potential Impact:** The ability to fine-tune LLMs to abstain appropriately without external labels and across diverse generation lengths enhances their trustworthiness and safety in high-stakes applications. The proposed AED metric also offers a more comprehensive evaluation standard for future research in uncertainty-aware LLMs, fostering the development of more reliable and helpful AI systems.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations, e.g., factually incorrect information, in their responses. These hallucinations present challenges for LLM-based applications that demand high factual accuracy. Existing hallucination detection methods primarily depend on external resources, which can suffer from issues such as low availability, incomplete coverage, privacy concerns, high latency, low reliability, and poor scalability. There are also methods depending on output probabilities, which are often inaccessible for closed-source LLMs like GPT models. This paper presents MetaQA, a self-contained hallucination detection approach that leverages metamorphic relation and prompt mutation. Unlike existing methods, MetaQA operates without any external resources and is compatible with both open-source and closed-source LLMs.\n \n \n \nMetaQA is based on the hypothesis that if an LLM’s response is a hallucination, the designed metamorphic relations will be violated. We compare MetaQA with the state-of-the-art zero-resource hallucination detection method, SelfCheckGPT, across multiple datasets, and on two open-source and two closed-source LLMs. Our results reveal that MetaQA outperforms SelfCheckGPT in terms of precision, recall, and f1 score. For the four LLMs we study, MetaQA outperforms SelfCheckGPT with a superiority margin ranging from 0.041 - 0.113 (for precision), 0.143 - 0.430 (for recall), and 0.154 - 0.368 (for F1-score).

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are useful tools with the capacity for performing specific types of knowledge work at an effective scale. However, LLM deployments in high-risk and safety-critical domains pose unique challenges, notably the issue of ``hallucination,'' where LLMs can generate fabricated information. This is particularly concerning in settings such as drug safety, where inaccuracies could lead to patient harm. To mitigate these risks, we have developed and demonstrated a proof of concept suite of guardrails specifically designed to mitigate certain types of hallucinations and errors for drug safety, and potentially applicable to other medical safety-critical contexts. These guardrails include mechanisms to detect anomalous documents to prevent the ingestion of inappropriate data, identify incorrect drug names or adverse event terms, and convey uncertainty in generated content. We integrated these guardrails with an LLM fine-tuned for a text-to-text task, which involves converting both structured and unstructured data within adverse event reports into natural language. This method was applied to translate individual case safety reports, demonstrating effective application in a pharmacovigilance processing task. Our guardrail framework offers a set of tools with broad applicability across various domains, ensuring LLMs can be safely used in high-risk situations by eliminating the occurrence of key errors, including the generation of incorrect pharmacovigilance-related terms, thus adhering to stringent regulatory and quality standards in medical safety-critical environments.",

        "abstract": "Although Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated exceptional abilities in understanding multimodal data, they invariably suffer from hallucinations, leading to a disconnect between the generated text and the corresponding images. Almost all current visual contrastive decoding methods attempt to mitigate these hallucinations by introducing visual uncertainty information that appropriately widens the contrastive logits gap between hallucinatory and targeted ones. However, due to uncontrollable nature of the global visual uncertainty, they struggle to precisely induce the hallucinatory tokens, which severely limits their effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and may even lead to the generation of undesired hallucinations. To tackle this issue, we conducted the theoretical analysis to promote the effectiveness of contrast decoding. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel optimization strategy named Hallucination-Induced Optimization (HIO). This strategy seeks to amplify the contrast between hallucinatory and targeted tokens relying on a fine-tuned theoretical preference model (i.e., Contrary Bradley-Terry Model), thereby facilitating efficient contrast decoding to alleviate hallucinations in LVLMs. Extensive experimental research demonstrates that our HIO strategy can effectively reduce hallucinations in LVLMs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks.",

Previous research has primarily focused on assessing the performance of LALMs across various tasks, yet overlooking their reliability, particularly concerning issues like object hallucination. In our study, we introduce methods to assess the extent of object hallucination of publicly available LALMs. Our findings reveal that LALMs are comparable to specialized audio captioning models in their understanding of audio content, but struggle to answer discriminative questions, specifically those requiring the identification of the presence of particular object sounds within an audio clip. This limitation highlights a critical weakness in current LALMs: their inadequate understanding of discriminative queries. Moreover, we explore the potential of prompt engineering to enhance LALMs' performance on discriminative questions.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review:\n\n### Technical Paper Analysis: Understanding Sounds, Missing the Questions: The Challenge of Object Hallucination in Large Audio-Language Models \\cite{kuan20249pm}\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific technical problem**: The paper addresses the issue of \"object hallucination\" in Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs), where models generate or affirm the presence of objects in audio that are not actually there.\n    *   **Why important and challenging**: LALMs integrate audio perception with Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle diverse audio-related tasks. While previous research has focused on task performance, the reliability of LALMs, particularly concerning hallucination, has been largely overlooked. Hallucination is a known problem in LLMs and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), but there was a lack of discussion and benchmarks for LALMs in the audio domain. This unreliability can lead to incorrect information and reduced trustworthiness in practical applications.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to existing approaches**: LALMs build upon traditional LLMs by adding audio perception capabilities. Existing LALM evaluation benchmarks like Dynamic-SUPERB \\cite{kuan20249pm} and AIR-Bench \\cite{kuan20249pm} primarily assess task performance.\n    *   **Limitations of previous solutions**: These benchmarks do not adequately evaluate the reliability of LALM-generated content, specifically object hallucination. While hallucination has been studied in LLMs and LVLMs (e.g., in image captioning), its prevalence and characteristics in LALMs within speech and audio domains were unexplored, and no specific benchmarks existed to measure it.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core technical method or algorithm**: The paper introduces novel methods to assess object hallucination in LALMs through two main task types:\n        *   **Discriminative Tasks**: Formulated as binary classification (Yes/No) to determine the presence of a specific object's sound. Questions are generated using positive (ground truth) and negative samples (Random, Popular, and Adversarial sampling strategies for non-existent objects). Performance is measured by accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and \"Yes\" answer ratio.\n        *   **Generative Tasks**: Involves audio captioning (e.g., \"Describe the audio\") and noisy Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Nouns are extracted from generated captions using NLP tools (SpaCy \\cite{kuan20249pm}) and compared against ground truth labels to identify hallucinated objects.\n    *   **What makes this approach novel or different**: This is the first work to systematically explore and quantify object hallucination in LALMs. It introduces specific evaluation methodologies and metrics tailored for this problem in the audio domain, including novel negative sampling strategies for discriminative questions and the ECHO (Evaluation of Caption Hallucination in audiO) and Cover metrics for generative tasks. It also explores prompt engineering as a mitigation strategy.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel algorithms, methods, or techniques**:\n        *   Introduction of discriminative and generative evaluation tasks specifically designed to measure object hallucination in LALMs.\n        *   Development of three negative sampling strategies (Random, Popular, Adversarial) for constructing discriminative questions.\n        *   Proposal of ECHO (instance-level ECHO_I and sentence-level ECHO_S) and Cover metrics for quantifying hallucination and coverage in generative audio captioning.\n        *   Investigation into prompt engineering techniques to improve LALM performance on discriminative tasks.\n    *   **Theoretical insights or analysis**: The paper reveals a critical discrepancy: LALMs perform well on audio captioning (generative tasks) but struggle significantly with discriminative questions, indicating a weakness in understanding the *nature* of discriminative queries rather than a fundamental inability to process audio content.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments conducted**:\n        *   Evaluated five publicly available LALMs: Qwen-Audio \\cite{kuan20249pm}, Qwen-Audio-Chat \\cite{kuan20249pm}, LTU-AS-7B \\cite{kuan20249pm}, SALMONN-7B \\cite{kuan20249pm}, and SALMONN-13B \\cite{kuan20249pm}.\n        *   Compared LALMs against a \"Specialized\" cascade pipeline (Whisper-based audio captioning \\cite{kuan20249pm} + ChatGPT \\cite{kuan20249pm} or LLaMA-7b-chat \\cite{kuan20249pm}).\n        *   Used AudioCaps \\cite{kuan20249pm} for audio captioning and CHIME-6 \\cite{kuan20249pm} for noisy ASR.\n        *   Tested five different prompts for both task types and explored greedy vs. sample decoding strategies.\n        *   Investigated eight different prefix prompts for prompt engineering on discriminative tasks.\n    *   **Key performance metrics and comparison results**:\n        *   **Discriminative Tasks**: LALMs exhibited significantly lower recall than precision, indicating a strong tendency to give affirmative answers (hallucinate). F1 scores decreased with more challenging negative sampling strategies (Adversarial < Popular < Random). LALMs were highly sensitive to prompt design. The \"Specialized\" cascade pipeline significantly outperformed all LALMs in F1 scores, highlighting a substantial gap.\n        *   **Generative Tasks**: LALMs' performance on ECHO and Cover metrics was comparable to specialized Whisper-based caption models, demonstrating their capability in understanding audio information and similar levels of object hallucination in captioning. Greedy decoding generally reduced hallucination in generative tasks.\n        *   **Prompt Engineering**: Specific prefix prompts, particularly those emphasizing careful consideration of the question (e.g., P3, P4, P6, P8), led to significant F1 score improvements for some LALMs (e.g., SALMONN models, Qwen-Audio-Chat-7B), but not universally (e.g., LTU-AS-7B showed degradation).\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical limitations or assumptions**: The study primarily focuses on object hallucination and suggests that LALMs' struggle lies in comprehending discriminative queries rather than processing audio content itself. The effectiveness of prompt engineering was model-dependent.\n    *   **Scope of applicability**: The proposed evaluation methods and insights are directly applicable to assessing and improving the reliability of LALMs in audio captioning and related audio understanding tasks.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **How does this advance the technical state-of-the-art**: This work is the first to systematically identify and quantify object hallucination in LALMs, filling a critical gap in LALM reliability research. It introduces novel and comprehensive evaluation methodologies (discriminative/generative tasks, ECHO/Cover metrics) that can serve as benchmarks for future LALM development. It highlights a crucial weakness in current LALMs regarding their understanding of discriminative queries, even when their audio comprehension is strong.\n    *   **Potential impact on future research**: The findings will guide future LALM research towards developing more robust models that are less prone to hallucination, particularly by focusing on improving query understanding mechanisms. It encourages the development of LALMs that can precisely discriminate information from audio, rather than just generating descriptive captions. The proposed evaluation framework provides a valuable tool for assessing the reliability of new LALM architectures.",

        "abstract": "Mitigating hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) remains an open problem. Recent benchmarks do not address hallucinations in open-ended free-form responses, which we term “Type I hallucinations”. Instead, they focus on hallucinations responding to very specific question formats-typically a multiple-choice response regarding a particular object or attribute-which we term “Type II hallucinations”. Additionally, such benchmarks often require external API calls to models which are subject to change. In practice, we observe that a reduction in Type II hallucinations does not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations but rather that the two forms of halluci-nations are often anti-correlated. To address this, we propose THRONE, a novel object-based automatic framework for quantitatively evaluating Type I hallucinations in LVLM free-form outputs. We use public language models (LMs) to identify hallucinations in LVLM responses and compute informative metrics. By evaluating a large selection of recent LVLMs using public datasets, we show that an improvement in existing metrics do not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations, and that established benchmarks for measuring Type I hallucinations are incomplete. Finally, we provide a simple and effective data augmentation method to reduce Type I and Type II hallucinations as a strong baseline.",

        "abstract": "Despite their impressive capabilities, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are prone to hallucinations, i.e., the generated content that is nonsensical or unfaithful to input sources. Unlike in LLMs, hallucinations in MLLMs often stem from the sensitivity of text decoder to visual tokens, leading to a phenomenon akin to\"amnesia\"about visual information. To address this issue, we propose MemVR, a novel decoding paradigm inspired by common cognition: when the memory of an image seen the moment before is forgotten, people will look at it again for factual answers. Following this principle, we treat visual tokens as supplementary evidence, re-injecting them into the MLLM through Feed Forward Network (FFN) as\"key-value memory\"at the middle trigger layer. This\"look-twice\"mechanism occurs when the model exhibits high uncertainty during inference, effectively enhancing factual alignment.

It extends the idea of external verifiers (like CLIP-DPO \\cite{deng202405j}) to handle long captions.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The framework comprises three main stages:\n        1.  **Controllable Dataset Generation**: The seed MLLM generates both positive and negative response candidates for a given image and instruction. Negative samples are generated by introducing a \"hallucination ratio\" (`hratio`) during the decoding process. This `hratio` blends token distributions from a conditional path (with image) and an unconditional path (without image), allowing precise control over the level of hallucination injected \\cite{deng202405j}.\n        2.  **Lightweight Preference Data Inversion**: A lightweight, contrastive language-image encoder (specifically, a CLIP model) is used to evaluate the quality of the generated positive and negative captions. It computes average sentence-level CLIP scores for each caption. If the initially designated \"positive\" caption scores lower than the \"negative\" caption, their labels are automatically swapped to ensure accurate preference learning \\cite{deng202405j}.\n        3.  **Preference Learning Finetuning**: The refined preference pairs are then used to finetune the seed MLLM using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) \\cite{deng202405j}, a simpler and more stable alternative to RLHF/RLAIF.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**: The key innovation is the \"judge-free\" nature of the verification process. Instead of relying on another MLLM, the framework uses a predefined, controllable mechanism for negative sample generation combined with a lightweight, objective verifier (CLIP-score) for data quality control and label inversion. This significantly reduces computational costs and mitigates the biases associated with MLLM-as-judge approaches \\cite{deng202405j}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Framework**: An efficient, model-level judge-free self-improvement framework for MLLMs that integrates a controllable hallucination mechanism for negative sample generation and a lightweight verifier for robust data quality control \\cite{deng202405j}.\n    *   **Controllable Negative Sample Generation**: A method to generate preference learning pairs by dynamically controlling the hallucination level in responses using a `hratio` to blend conditional and unconditional decoding paths \\cite{deng202405j}.\n    *   **Lightweight Verification and Data Inversion**: Utilization of a lightweight CLIP model to objectively evaluate and automatically reverse preference labels based on average sentence-level CLIP scores, ensuring high-quality training data without MLLM-level computational overhead \\cite{deng202405j}.\n    *   **New Evaluation Dataset**: Introduction of the \"IC dataset,\" specifically designed to comprehensively challenge MLLMs' hallucination control by evaluating both precision and recall of generated captions, with GPT-4o-assisted evaluation \\cite{deng202405j}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: The proposed framework was evaluated by training a self-improved model (`m1`) from a seed model (`m0`) using the generated and verified preference data. The improved model's performance was then assessed on two benchmarks.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   **Seed Model**: LLaVA-1.5-13B \\cite{deng202405j}.\n        *   **Datasets**: The newly collected IC dataset (150 challenging images, evaluated by GPT-4o for precision, recall, and F1 score) and the public Object HalBench dataset \\cite{deng202405j}.\n        *   **Data Generation**: 100k image-instruction pairs from the LLaVA instruction tuning dataset were used to generate preference pairs with varying `hratio` \\cite{deng202405j}.\n        *   **Verification**: A CLIP model was used to compute average sentence-level CLIP scores, and pairs were swapped if the initial negative caption scored higher than the positive \\cite{deng202405j}.\n        *   **Training**: DPO was applied to a subset of the preference dataset, with training conducted on an 8xA100 node \\cite{deng202405j}.\n        *   **Results**: The self-improved model (`m1`) demonstrated \"significantly better performance\" over the original seed model (`m0`) on both the IC and Object HalBench datasets \\cite{deng202405j}. The method achieved \"superior precision and recall with significantly lower computational demands\" compared to conventional techniques \\cite{deng202405j}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: While not explicitly detailed in the provided text, the \"lightweight\" nature of the verifier (CLIP model) implies a reliance on its inherent capabilities for semantic similarity. The effectiveness of the `hratio` for controlled hallucination generation is also a key assumption. The paper focuses on improving MLLM reliability and robustness, particularly concerning hallucination.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The method is primarily applicable to MLLMs for self-improvement tasks, particularly those involving caption generation and hallucination control. It offers a general framework for generating and filtering preference data efficiently.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: This work advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing an efficient and scalable pathway for MLLM self-improvement that bypasses the computational and reliability issues of MLLM-as-judge approaches \\cite{deng202405j}. It demonstrates that high-quality preference data can be generated and verified without relying on expensive and potentially biased large models.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: The judge-free framework could inspire future research into more resource-efficient and robust self-improvement mechanisms for large models, reducing the barriers to entry for training and finetuning. It opens avenues for exploring alternative lightweight verifiers and more sophisticated controllable data generation strategies, ultimately leading to more reliable and trustworthy MLLMs \\cite{deng202405j}.",

        "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) contribute a powerful mechanism to understanding visual information building on large language models. However, MLLMs are notorious for suffering from hallucinations, especially when generating lengthy, detailed descriptions for images. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations stem from the inherent summarization mechanism of large language models, leading to excessive dependence on linguistic tokens while neglecting vision information. In this paper, we propose NoiseBoost, a broadly applicable and simple method for alleviating hallucinations for MLLMs through the integration of noise feature perturbations. Noise perturbation acts as a regularizer, facilitating a balanced distribution of attention weights among visual and linguistic tokens. Despite its simplicity, NoiseBoost consistently enhances the performance of MLLMs across common training strategies, including supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Further, NoiseBoost pioneerly enables semi-supervised learning for MLLMs, unleashing the power of unlabeled data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that NoiseBoost improves dense caption accuracy by 8.1% with human evaluation and achieves comparable results with 50% of the data by mining unlabeled data.

The problem stems from MLLMs' inherent summarization mechanism, leading to an excessive dependence on linguistic tokens and neglect of visual information. This over-reliance on language priors is exacerbated by the feature disparity between separately pre-trained visual encoders and LLMs, worsening with longer generation lengths.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches**: Previous work on mitigating hallucination primarily focuses on developing tailored decoders (e.g., OPERA \\cite{wu2024n00}, visual contrastive decoding \\cite{wu2024n00}) or annotating hallucination-specific data (e.g., HallDoctor \\cite{wu2024n00}, Fine-grained PPO \\cite{wu2024n00}).\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Re-decoding methods significantly increase inference time (doubling or tripling), making MLLMs challenging for deployment on personal devices.

        "abstract": "Recently, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in multi-modal context comprehension. However, they still suffer from hallucination problems referring to generating inconsistent outputs with the image content. To mitigate hallucinations, previous studies mainly focus on retraining LVLMs with custom datasets. Although effective, they inherently come with additional computational costs. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework, \\textbf{MVP}, that aims to reduce hallucinations by making the most of the innate capabilities of the LVLMs via \\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{V}iew Multi-\\textbf{P}ath Reasoning. Specifically, we first devise a multi-view information-seeking strategy to thoroughly perceive the comprehensive information in the image, which enriches the general global information captured by the original vision encoder in LVLMs. Furthermore, during the answer decoding, we observe that the occurrence of hallucinations has a strong correlation with the certainty of the answer tokens. Thus, we propose multi-path reasoning for each information view to quantify and aggregate the certainty scores for each potential answer among multiple decoding paths and finally decide the output answer. By fully grasping the information in the image and carefully considering the certainty of the potential answers when decoding, our MVP can effectively reduce hallucinations in LVLMs.The extensive experiments verify that our proposed MVP significantly mitigates the hallucination problem across four well-known LVLMs. The source code is available at: \\url{https://github.com/GasolSun36/MVP}.",

Research Problem & Motivation**\n\n*   **Specific Technical Problem**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) frequently suffer from \"hallucination,\" where they generate text that is semantically plausible but factually inconsistent or inaccurate with the visual content of an image. This includes misidentifying objects, miscounting quantities, or describing non-existent elements.\n*   **Importance and Challenge**: Hallucinations undermine the trustworthiness and reliability of LVLMs, which are increasingly deployed in critical applications like healthcare, autonomous systems, and robotics. Addressing this issue is crucial to prevent erroneous decisions and ensure the safe and effective use of these models. The challenge lies in mitigating hallucinations without incurring significant computational costs or requiring extensive retraining.\n\n### **2. Related Work & Positioning**\n\n*   **Existing Approaches**:\n    *   **Retraining LVLMs**: Most prior work focuses on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) using custom hallucination-related datasets.\n    *   **Training-free Paradigms**: Some recent methods, like Woodpecker and MARINE, explore training-free approaches.\n*   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n    *   **Retraining**: Inherently comes with substantial computational costs, requires a large number of high-quality training examples, and is time-consuming and labor-intensive.\n    *   **Training-free (prior art)**: Often heavily rely on external, complicated tools (e.g., Grounding DINO, BLIP-2-FlanT5X), introducing additional dependencies and complexity.\n*   **Positioning of this Work**: \\cite{qu2024pqc} proposes a novel *training-free* framework, MVP, that *maximizes the innate capabilities of existing LVLMs* without introducing additional training costs or relying on external tools. It addresses hallucination by tackling two root causes: incomplete comprehension of image content and low certainty during answer token decoding.\n\n### **3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n\n*   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes MVP (Multi-View Multi-Path Reasoning), a training-free framework that enhances LVLM inference by:\n    1.  **Multi-View Information Seeking**: Devising a strategy to thoroughly perceive comprehensive image information from varying dimensions (\"top-down,\" \"regular,\" and \"bottom-up\" views). This information is generated by the LVLMs themselves using dedicated prompts, enriching the global visual context captured by the original vision encoder.\n    2.  **Multi-Path Certainty-Driven Reasoning**: During answer decoding, it observes that hallucinations correlate with low certainty of answer tokens. It quantifies the \"Certainty Score\" (difference between top-two token probabilities) for potential answers. It then generates multiple decoding paths (e.g., by considering top-K candidate first tokens) and aggregates the certainty scores for each potential answer across these paths and across different information views. The answer with the highest aggregated certainty score is selected as the final output.\n*   **Novelty/Differentiation**:\n    *   **Training-free and Tool-free**: Unlike retraining methods or other training-free approaches that use external tools, MVP leverages only the inherent capabilities of the target LVLM.\n    *   **Comprehensive Image Understanding**: Introduces a multi-view strategy to extract richer visual information directly from the LVLM, going beyond the single global representation.\n    *   **Certainty-Driven Decoding**: Explicitly quantifies and utilizes the certainty of answer tokens during decoding, guiding the model to more reliable outputs by exploring multiple reasoning paths.\n\n### **4. Key Technical Contributions**\n\n*   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**:\n    *   A multi-view information-seeking strategy that uses LVLM-generated captions from \"bottom-up,\" \"regular,\" and \"top-down\" perspectives to enrich image understanding without external tools.\n    *   A multi-path certainty-driven reasoning mechanism that quantifies answer certainty based on token probability differences and aggregates these scores across multiple decoding paths and information views.\n*   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: MVP is a plug-and-play framework that can be integrated with existing LVLMs and potentially other decoding methods, enhancing their performance without modifying their internal architecture or requiring retraining.\n*   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: Identifies and leverages the strong correlation between the occurrence of hallucinations and the low certainty of answer tokens during decoding, providing a principled way to mitigate them.\n\n### **5. Experimental Validation**\n\n*   **Experiments Conducted**: Extensive experiments were conducted on four state-of-the-art LVLMs (LLaVA-1.5, Qwen-VL, InstructBLIP, and mPLUG-Owl2, all with 7B LLM backbones).\n*   **Benchmarks**: Evaluated on two widely-used hallucination benchmarks:\n    *   **POPE (Polling-based Object Probing Evaluation)**: Assesses object presence/absence across random, popular, and adversarial settings, using data from MSCOCO, A-OKVQA, and GQA.\n    *   **MME (Multi-modal Model Evaluation)**: A comprehensive benchmark covering 10 perception-related and 4 cognition-focused subtasks, with specific focus on existence, count, position, and color subsets for object/attribute-level hallucination.\n*   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n    *   **POPE**: MVP significantly outperformed vanilla LVLMs and recent training-free baselines (VCD, OPERA) across all models and settings. For LLaVA-1.5, MVP achieved an average improvement of 15.9 in Accuracy and 21.84 in F1 score across random, popular, and adversarial settings on MSCOCO. Improvements were primarily driven by increased recall (LLaVA-1.5, Qwen-VL, InstructBLIP) or a balanced improvement in both precision and recall (mPLUG-Owl2).\n    *   **MME**: (Details not fully provided in the excerpt, but the abstract states \"extensive experiments verify that our proposed MVP significantly mitigates the hallucination problem across four well-known LVLMs.\")\n    *   **Visual Richness**: Statistical analysis showed that the multi-view information-seeking strategy significantly increased the number of objects recognized in captions (e.g., LLaVA-1.5 recognized 36.66 objects/image with multi-view vs. 16.43 with regular captioning).\n\n### **6. Limitations & Scope**\n\n*   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**:\n    *   The effectiveness relies on the LVLM's ability to generate meaningful multi-view captions and its internal probability distributions for certainty scoring.\n    *   The \"training-free\" nature means it doesn't fundamentally alter the LVLM's learned representations but rather optimizes its inference process.\n    *   Hyperparameters like `K` (number of paths) and `alpha_i` (view importance) need to be tuned.\n*   **Scope of Applicability**: MVP is designed for mitigating hallucinations in existing LVLMs during inference. It is applicable to various LVLMs and can be combined with other decoding methods. Its primary focus is on factual consistency with image content, particularly for object presence, count, and attributes.\n\n### **7. Technical Significance**\n\n*   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: \\cite{qu2024pqc} introduces a highly effective and efficient training-free method for hallucination mitigation in LVLMs, outperforming existing training-free baselines. It demonstrates that significant improvements can be achieved by intelligently leveraging the innate capabilities of pre-trained models without costly retraining or external tools.\n*   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n    *   Encourages further exploration of inference-time optimization strategies for LVLMs, potentially reducing the reliance on expensive fine-tuning.\n    *   Highlights the importance of comprehensive visual grounding and robust decoding mechanisms in multi-modal models.\n    *   The plug-and-play nature of MVP makes it a valuable component for enhancing the reliability of LVLMs in real-world applications, fostering greater trust in AI-generated content.\n\n---",

        "title": "LongHalQA: Long-Context Hallucination Evaluation for MultiModal Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "Hallucination, a phenomenon where multimodal large language models~(MLLMs) tend to generate textual responses that are plausible but unaligned with the image, has become one major hurdle in various MLLM-related applications. Several benchmarks have been created to gauge the hallucination levels of MLLMs, by either raising discriminative questions about the existence of objects or introducing LLM evaluators to score the generated text from MLLMs. However, the discriminative data largely involve simple questions that are not aligned with real-world text, while the generative data involve LLM evaluators that are computationally intensive and unstable due to their inherent randomness. We propose LongHalQA, an LLM-free hallucination benchmark that comprises 6K long and complex hallucination text. LongHalQA is featured by GPT4V-generated hallucinatory data that are well aligned with real-world scenarios, including object/image descriptions and multi-round conversations with 14/130 words and 189 words, respectively, on average. It introduces two new tasks, hallucination discrimination and hallucination completion, unifying both discriminative and generative evaluations in a single multiple-choice-question form and leading to more reliable and efficient evaluations without the need for LLM evaluators. Further, we propose an advanced pipeline that greatly facilitates the construction of future hallucination benchmarks with long and complex questions and descriptions. Extensive experiments over multiple recent MLLMs reveal various new challenges when they are handling hallucinations with long and complex textual data. Dataset and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/hanqiu-hq/LongHalQA.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review, emphasizing technical innovations and empirical validation:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently generate \"hallucinations\"—textual responses that are plausible but misaligned with the input image. This significantly compromises their reliability and applicability.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: Effective and efficient measurement of MLLM hallucination levels is crucial for diagnosis and mitigation. Existing benchmarks suffer from several limitations:\n        *   **Oversimplification**: Discriminative benchmarks use simple, short questions (e.g., \"Is there an {object}?\") that are not representative of real-world scenarios and fail to capture complex hallucination causes.\n        *   **Limited Variability**: Many benchmarks rely on off-the-shelf object annotations (e.g., COCO's 80 categories), leading to biased evaluations and limited scope of hallucination types.\n        *   **Computational Cost & Instability**: Generative benchmarks often employ LLM evaluators, which are computationally intensive, slow, and prone to instability due to their inherent randomness.\n        *   **Lack of Long-Context Evaluation**: Previous benchmarks largely ignore hallucinations in long, complex textual contexts, which are common in real-world MLLM applications like detailed descriptions or multi-round conversations.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches**: Previous work includes discriminative benchmarks (e.g., POPE, CIEM, AMBER) focusing on object existence/attributes with simple \"yes/no\" answers, and generative benchmarks (e.g., Hal-Eval, Kaul et al.) using LLM evaluators for free-form text analysis.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   Most discriminative benchmarks use short, simple questions and binary answers, failing to capture the nuances and causes of hallucinations.\n        *   Generative benchmarks are slow and unstable due to reliance on LLM evaluators.\n        *   Both types often have limited scope regarding hallucination types and object variability.\n        *   Crucially, they lack evaluation for long-context hallucinations, which are prevalent in advanced MLLM applications.\n    *   **Positioning of LongHalQA**: \\cite{qiu2024zyc} addresses these limitations by introducing an LLM-free, long-context hallucination benchmark that unifies discriminative and generative evaluations into an efficient multiple-choice question (MCQ) format, covering a broader range of complex hallucination types and real-world scenarios.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: \\cite{qiu2024zyc} proposes **LongHalQA**, an LLM-free hallucination benchmark with 6K long and complex hallucination texts, and **LongHallGen**, an automated pipeline for generating such data.\n    *   **Novelty**:\n        *   **Unified MCQ Format**: Introduces two novel tasks, **Hallucination Discrimination** and **Hallucination Completion**, both framed as multiple-choice questions. This unifies discriminative and generative evaluations, making them more reliable and efficient by eliminating the need for costly and unstable LLM evaluators.\n        *   **Long-Context Data**: Features three types of long-context data: Object-level Description (avg. 14 words), Image-level Description (avg. 130 words), and Multi-round Conversation (avg. 189 words). This is significantly longer and more complex than existing benchmarks, better simulating real-world MLLM usage.\n        *   **Broad Hallucination Coverage**: Categorizes and annotates 12 distinct types of hallucinations, including complex ones involving logic and contextual consistency (e.g., \"four such plates\" vs. \"five plates\"), which are often overlooked.\n        *   **Automated Data Generation Pipeline (LongHallGen)**: Proposes a generic pipeline that leverages GPT-4V with specific prompt templates to automatically generate long-context hallucinatory data, perform hallucination checks (with optional human verification), create hallucination-explanation pairs, and construct MCQs. This greatly facilitates the creation and expansion of future benchmarks.\n        *   **LLM-Free Evaluation**: The MCQ format allows for direct, objective evaluation without relying on the subjective and computationally expensive outputs of LLM evaluators.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Benchmark (LongHalQA)**: A new, large-scale (6485 MCQs) benchmark specifically designed for evaluating long-context hallucinations in MLLMs, featuring diverse data formats and hallucination types.\n    *   **Innovative Evaluation Tasks**: Introduction of Hallucination Discrimination and Hallucination Completion tasks, both in an MCQ format, enabling efficient and reliable assessment of MLLMs' ability to identify and avoid generating hallucinations in long texts.\n    *   **Automated Data Generation Pipeline (LongHallGen)**: A robust, automated pipeline for constructing long-context hallucination datasets, significantly reducing manual effort and enabling scalable benchmark creation.\n    *   **Empirical Insights**: Reveals new challenges for MLLMs in handling long-context hallucinations and identifies limitations of common mitigation techniques like Chain-Of-Thought (COT) in this context.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: \\cite{qiu2024zyc} evaluates ten mainstream MLLMs (e.g., LLaVA-1.5, InstructBLIP, Qwen-VL-Chat, CogVLM) on the LongHalQA benchmark.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**:\n        *   For Hallucination Discrimination: Accuracy, Precision, and \"Yes\" ratios (for binary settings), and (mc-)accuracy for multiple-choice settings.\n        *   For Hallucination Completion: (mc-)accuracy.\n    *   **Comparison Results**:\n        *   **MLLMs struggle with long-context hallucinations**: Evaluations reveal significant constraints of MLLMs in discerning, explaining, and avoiding generating hallucinations within long and complex texts.\n        *   **COT limitations**: Chain-Of-Thought (COT), a common hallucination mitigation method, is found to be effective for short queries and generative hallucinations but *degrades* performance for most MLLMs on long-context hallucination discrimination in LongHalQA, especially for smaller models. This suggests that COT's effectiveness is limited by MLLMs' long-context processing capabilities.\n        *   **MCQ vs. Free-form**: Experiments demonstrate that the MCQ hallucination completion task exhibits similar trends to free-form generative evaluation, while offering significantly higher evaluation speed, especially for large models.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**: The paper highlights that even state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4V, used for data generation, suffer from severe hallucinations when generating long-context data (e.g., 78.8% of image-level descriptions and 82.4% of conversations contained at least one hallucination). This necessitates a comprehensive hallucination check process within LongHallGen.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: LongHalQA focuses on long-context textual hallucinations related to object/image descriptions and multi-round conversations. While comprehensive, it is tailored to these specific interaction patterns. The LongHallGen pipeline is generic and can be adapted for other hallucination types or domains by modifying prompt sets.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art**: \\cite{qiu2024zyc} significantly advances the evaluation of MLLM hallucinations by moving beyond simple, short queries to realistic, long-context scenarios. It provides a more comprehensive and efficient evaluation framework.\n    *   **Enables Deeper Analysis**: The detailed annotation of 12 hallucination types, including complex logical and contextual inconsistencies, allows for more in-depth studies of MLLM failure modes.\n    *   **Facilitates Future Research**: LongHallGen provides a powerful, automated tool for researchers to create new hallucination benchmarks or expand existing ones, accelerating the development of more robust MLLMs.\n    *   **Impact on Mitigation Strategies**: The findings regarding COT's degradation in long-context discrimination highlight the need for new or improved hallucination mitigation methods specifically designed for complex, extended interactions. LongHalQA serves as a crucial basis for developing and testing such methods.",

        "title": "ClearSight: Visual Signal Enhancement for Object Hallucination Mitigation in Multimodal Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "Contrastive decoding strategies are widely used to mitigate object hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By reducing over-reliance on language priors, these strategies ensure that generated content remains closely grounded in visual inputs, producing contextually accurate outputs. Since contrastive decoding requires no additional training or external tools, it offers both computational efficiency and versatility, making it highly attractive. However, these methods present two main limitations: (1) bluntly suppressing language priors can compromise coherence and accuracy of generated content, and (2) processing contrastive inputs adds computational load, significantly slowing inference speed. To address these challenges, we propose Visual Amplification Fusion (VAF), a plug-and-play technique that enhances attention to visual signals within the model’s middle layers, where modality fusion predominantly occurs. This approach enables more effective capture of visual features, reducing the model’s bias toward language modality. Experimental results demonstrate that VAF significantly reduces hallucinations across various MLLMs without affecting inference speed, while maintaining coherence and accuracy in generated outputs.

This paper introduced a novel sampling-based approach, where an LLM's consistency across multiple generated samples was used to infer the factuality of its output. This was a crucial step, enabling black-box detection without internal model access or external databases. Following this, **AutoHall: Automated Hallucination Dataset Generation for Large Language Models (2023)** \\cite{cao2023ecl} refined this black-box detection by having the LLM itself detect contradictions among its own samples, moving away from external metrics like BERTScore.\n\n    The focus then significantly shifted towards *mitigation and self-correction during generation*. **Chain-of-Verification Reduces Hallucination in Large Language Models (2023)** \\cite{dhuliawala2023rqn} introduced a multi-step self-deliberation framework (CoVe) where the LLM plans, executes, and revises its own responses, crucially using \"factored\" verification to prevent error propagation. This was further advanced by **Towards Mitigating Hallucination in Large Language Models via Self-Reflection (2023)** \\cite{ji2023vhv}, which proposed an *iterative self-reflection methodology*. This dynamic feedback loop allowed the LLM to continuously refine both its acquired knowledge and generated answers, demonstrating a more sophisticated form of internal self-correction, particularly in high-stakes domains like medicine.\n\n    The most significant leap in proactivity came with **Zero-Resource Hallucination Prevention for Large Language Models (2023)** \\cite{luo2023xyc}. This work introduced `SELF-FAMILIARITY`, a *pre-detection prevention* method that assesses the LLM's familiarity with input concepts *before* generating a response. This marked a paradigm shift from detecting or correcting errors to proactively avoiding them.\n\n*   *Problem evolution*: Early papers like **SelfCheckGPT (2023)** \\cite{manakul20236ex} addressed the fundamental problem of detecting hallucinations in black-box LLMs, a capability previously limited by access requirements or resource intensity. **HaluEval: A Large-Scale Hallucination Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models (2023)** \\cite{li2023rvf} then highlighted the lack of comprehensive evaluation, revealing the extent and types of hallucinations in general LLMs and their poor recognition abilities. **AutoHall (2023)** \\cite{cao2023ecl} tackled the practical challenge of costly, time-consuming, and quickly obsolete manual dataset annotation, while also seeking to improve detection performance.\n\n    As detection matured, the problem evolved to *how to prevent or correct* these errors. **Chain-of-Verification (2023)** \\cite{dhuliawala2023rqn} directly confronted the issue of LLMs generating and repeating factual inaccuracies, especially in long-form text, and the challenge of \"exposure bias\" in self-correction. **Towards Mitigating Hallucination in Large Language Models via Self-Reflection (2023)** \\cite{ji2023vhv} focused on the critical need for reliable LLM outputs in sensitive domains like medicine, where even subtle hallucinations can have severe consequences, and where traditional evaluation metrics fall short. Finally, **Zero-Resource Hallucination Prevention (2023)** \\cite{luo2023xyc} addressed the inherent limitations of post-detection methods, aiming to eliminate hallucinations at the source by preventing generation when the model is unfamiliar with the topic.\n\n*   *Key innovations*: **SelfCheckGPT (2023)** \\cite{manakul20236ex} introduced the novel sampling-based paradigm for black-box detection. **HaluEval (2023)** \\cite{li2023rvf} provided the first large-scale, multi-task benchmark and an automated framework for hallucination generation. **AutoHall (2023)** \\cite{cao2023ecl} innovated with automated, model-specific dataset generation and LLM-driven self-contradiction for detection. **Chain-of-Verification (2023)** \\cite{dhuliawala2023rqn} brought the \"factored\" verification strategy to prevent error propagation during self-correction. **Towards Mitigating Hallucination in Large Language Models via Self-Reflection (2023)** \\cite{ji2023vhv} introduced the iterative self-reflection loop and domain-specific evaluation metrics (Med-NLI, CTRL-Eval). **Zero-Resource Hallucination Prevention (2023)** \\cite{luo2023xyc} pioneered the \"Concept Guessing\" mechanism for quantitative self-familiarity assessment, enabling proactive prevention.\n\n**Trend 2: Deepening Understanding and Mechanistic Interventions**\n\n*   *Methodological progression*: Alongside the development of detection and mitigation techniques, a parallel trend focused on *understanding the phenomenon of hallucination itself* and developing *mechanistic interventions*. This began with the need for structured evaluation, as seen in **HaluEval (2023)** \\cite{li2023rvf}, which provided a large-scale benchmark to characterize hallucinations. The field then saw the emergence of comprehensive *surveys* that aimed to consolidate knowledge and provide frameworks. **Automatically Correcting Large Language Models: Surveying the landscape of diverse self-correction strategies (2023)** \\cite{pan2023mwu} offered a broad taxonomy of automated self-correction, including hallucination. This was followed by **Siren's Song in the AI Ocean: A Survey on Hallucination in Large Language Models (2023)** \\cite{zhang2023k1j}, which provided an LLM-centric taxonomy of hallucination (input-conflicting, context-conflicting, fact-conflicting) and analyzed its sources and mitigation across the entire LLM lifecycle.\n\n    This deeper understanding paved the way for interventions that targeted the *internal workings* of LLMs. **OPERA: Alleviating Hallucination in Multi-Modal Large Language Models via Over-Trust Penalty and Retrospection-Allocation (2023)** \\cite{huang2023du3} is a prime example, extending hallucination research to *multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs)*. OPERA introduced a decoding-time strategy that directly manipulated the self-attention mechanism, penalizing \"over-trust\" patterns observed to cause hallucinations. The most recent survey, **Cognitive Mirage: A Review of Hallucinations in Large Language Models (2023)** \\cite{ye2023yom}, further deepened this mechanistic understanding by providing an in-depth analysis of hallucination origins rooted in data collection, knowledge gaps, and the optimization process, coupled with a highly detailed, task-specific taxonomy.\n\n*   *Problem evolution*: The initial problem was simply *identifying* hallucinations. As LLMs became more complex, the problem became *understanding why* they hallucinate and *how to intervene at a fundamental level*. **HaluEval (2023)** \\cite{li2023rvf} began by quantifying the problem, showing that LLMs struggle to recognize their own errors. The surveys by **Pan et al. (2023)** \\cite{pan2023mwu} and **Zhang et al. (2023)** \\cite{zhang2023k1j] addressed the challenge of organizing a rapidly expanding body of research, clarifying definitions, and identifying the diverse sources of hallucination across the LLM development pipeline.\n\n    The emergence of MLLMs introduced a new problem space: hallucinations in multi-modal contexts. **OPERA (2023)** \\cite{huang2023du3} specifically addressed this by identifying \"knowledge aggregation patterns\" in self-attention as a root cause for MLLM hallucinations, and sought a cost-effective solution. **Cognitive Mirage (2023)** \\cite{ye2023yom} aimed to provide a comprehensive theoretical grounding for all types of hallucinations, addressing the need for a unified understanding of their underlying mechanisms to guide future, more effective mitigation strategies.\n\n*   *Key innovations*: **HaluEval (2023)** \\cite{li2023rvf} innovated with its automated hallucination generation framework for large-scale evaluation. **Pan et al. (2023)** \\cite{pan2023mwu} and **Zhang et al. (2023)** \\cite{zhang2023k1j} provided crucial taxonomies and analytical frameworks that structured the field. **OPERA (2023)** \\cite{huang2023du3} introduced the novel \"Over-trust Penalty\" and \"Retrospection-Allocation\" decoding strategies, directly targeting self-attention patterns in MLLMs. **Cognitive Mirage (2023)** \\cite{ye2023yom} contributed a highly detailed, task-specific taxonomy and a profound mechanistic analysis of hallucination origins (data, knowledge, optimization), offering a foundational theoretical understanding.\n\n3. *Synthesis*:\nThe intellectual trajectory of these works reflects a rapid and comprehensive response to the critical challenge of LLM hallucination, evolving from initial black-box detection to sophisticated proactive prevention and deep mechanistic interventions. Collectively, these papers have established robust evaluation benchmarks, pioneered diverse self-correction paradigms, and provided foundational theoretical frameworks, significantly advancing the reliability and trustworthiness of large language models across various applications."

The field is now deeply engaged in understanding *why* models hallucinate at a mechanistic level, developing highly efficient and targeted mitigation strategies, and rigorously evaluating both models and the evaluation tools themselves. The emphasis on robustness, trustworthiness, and real-world applicability is paramount.\n\n**Temporal Positioning:**\n\nAll new papers are from 2024 or 2025, representing the cutting-edge and latest developments in the field. They build directly on the foundation laid by the earlier papers (mostly 2023) in the previous synthesis.\n\n---\n\n**Updated Evolution Analysis:**\n\nThe research into \"Hallucination in Large Language Models\" has undergone a rapid and profound evolution, marked by an increasingly sophisticated understanding of the problem, a diversification of evaluation methodologies, and the emergence of highly efficient and mechanistically insightful mitigation strategies. This trajectory, initially focused on vision-language models, has now broadened to encompass a wider array of modalities and even the dynamic behavior of hallucinations.\n\n**Trend 1: Expanding Scope and Granularity of Hallucination Definition and Evaluation**\n\nThe initial focus on \"object hallucination\" in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with methods like **POPE (Polling-based Object Probing Evaluation)** [li2023249] quickly expanded to address prompt bias and nuanced descriptive contexts with **HaELM** [wang2023zop]. This trend has continued to deepen, moving towards an even finer-grained analysis of hallucination types and their evaluation.\n\nA significant progression is the focus on **relation hallucinations**, where models misrepresent relationships between objects. **Unified Triplet-Level Hallucination Evaluation** [wu20241us] introduced a framework to simultaneously measure object and relation hallucinations using (object, relation, object) triplets, revealing that relation hallucination is often *more severe* than object hallucination. Further refining this, **R-Bench** [wu2024bxt] provided a data-leakage-free benchmark specifically for relationship hallucinations, using both image-level and instance-level questions to analyze co-occurrence patterns. The evaluation scope also expanded to **free-form generations** with **THRONE** [kaul2024ta7], the first benchmark for \"Type I\" hallucinations in open-ended LVLM outputs, leveraging open-source LMs for semantic judgment, a significant advancement over simple text matching.\n\nBeyond object and relation, the field now addresses **domain-specific hallucinations**. **Detecting and Evaluating Medical Hallucinations** [chen2024hfe] introduced **Med-HallMark**, the first benchmark for medical multimodal hallucination, along with **MediHall Score** (a hierarchical, clinically relevant metric) and **MediHallDetector** (a specialized detection model), highlighting the critical need for domain-aware evaluation.\n\nThe robustness of models under real-world conditions became a new focus. **Hallu-PI** [ding2024o88] is the first benchmark to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs under *perturbed inputs* (e.g., cropping, blurring, misleading prompts), revealing significant vulnerabilities. Complementing this, **BEAF (BEfore-AFter Changes)** [yebin2024txh] innovated by manipulating *visual scenes* (e.g., object removal) to assess whether LVLMs truly understand visual changes or merely rely on learned associations, introducing \"change-aware metrics\" like True Understanding and Stubbornness.\n\nThe proliferation of benchmarks necessitated a critical self-assessment. **Evaluating the Quality of Hallucination Benchmarks** [yan2024ux8] introduced **HQM (Hallucination benchmark Quality Measurement framework)**, a psychometrics-inspired framework to assess benchmark reliability and validity, and proposed **HQH (High-Quality Hallucination Benchmark)**, marking a crucial step towards ensuring trustworthy evaluation. Finally, several comprehensive surveys [lan20240yz, liu2024sn3, bai2024tkm] have emerged, providing updated taxonomies and consolidating the rapidly expanding understanding of hallucination causes, types, and evaluation methods in LVLMs and MLLMs.\n\n**Trend 2: Evolving Mitigation Strategies: From Costly Prevention to Efficient Post-hoc/Decoding-Time Correction**\n\nThe evolution of mitigation strategies has consistently moved towards more efficient, training-free, and mechanistically insightful interventions, building upon early efforts like **LURE** [zhou2023zu6] and **Visual Contrastive Decoding (VCD)** [leng2023ohr].\n\nA key development is the integration of **external knowledge augmentation**. **Active Retrieval Augmentation (ARA)** [qu20246yn] introduced a novel framework for LVLMs, employing active triggering, coarse-to-fine hierarchical retrieval, and reranking to ground responses in external knowledge, addressing the limitations of naive RAG transfer from LLMs. Similarly, **MARINE (Mitigating hallucin Ation via image-g Rounded guIdaNcE)** [zhao2024ge8] leverages external specialized vision models to generate \"guidance prompts\" and integrate them via classifier-free guidance during inference, directly tackling intrinsic causes of hallucination.\n\nInterventions are now targeting **intrinsic model states and mechanisms**. **Memory-Space Visual Retracing (MemVR)** [zou2024dp7] re-injects visual tokens into intermediate FFN layers, dynamically activated by uncertainty, to combat \"visual amnesia.\" **ClearSight** [yin2025s2b] with its **Visual Amplification Fusion (VAF)** method, enhances attention to visual signals in MLLM's *middle layers* to counter insufficient visual attention, preserving content quality and inference speed. **ICT (Image-Object Cross-Level Trusted Intervention)** [chen2024j0g] further refines this by intervening on *specific attention heads* during the forward pass to enhance focus on both overall image and fine-grained object details, while preserving beneficial language priors. A more theoretical approach, **CAUSAL MM** [zhou2024lvp], applies *causal inference* and counterfactual reasoning to attention mechanisms to mitigate modality prior-induced hallucinations, moving beyond statistical correlations.\n\nThe generation of **AI-driven preference data** and **judge-free learning** has emerged as a scalable alternative to costly human feedback. **POVID (Preference Optimization in VLLM with AI-Generated Dispreferences)** [zhou2024wbi] automates the creation of dispreferred responses using GPT-4V for textual hallucinations and diffusion noise for inherent ones, integrated into a DPO framework. Further, a **model-level judge-free self-improvement framework** [deng202405j] uses a controllable \"hallucination ratio\" for negative sample generation and a lightweight CLIP-score for preference data inversion, significantly reducing computational costs and MLLM-as-judge biases.\n\nOther notable advancements include **ConVis** [park20247cm], which uses a *Text-to-Image (T2I) model* to visualize potential hallucinations, providing a novel visual contrastive signal for decoding. **LogicCheckGPT** [wu2024h81] introduces a training-free \"logical closed loop\" framework for self-correction, leveraging the LVLM's inherent reasoning by checking consistency across related questions. **Skip \\n** [han202439z] identifies a unique \"semantic shift bias\" related to paragraph breaks and offers simple, efficient prompt engineering or logit manipulation to mitigate it. Finally, **Hallucination-Induced Optimization (HIO)** [chen20247jb] refines contrastive decoding by training an \"Evil LVLM\" to *prioritize* hallucinations, providing a more precise contrastive signal, while **VaLiD (Visual-Layer Fusion Contrastive Decoding)** [wang2024vym] addresses \"Visual Encoding Distortion\" in vision encoders by fusing uncertainty-guided features from early visual layers.\n\n**New Trend 3: Expanding to New Modalities and Cross-Modal Hallucination**\n\nThe understanding of hallucination has transcended the vision-language domain, recognizing it as a fundamental challenge across all multimodal AI. This new trend explores how hallucinations manifest and can be mitigated in other modalities and their complex interactions.\n\n**Object Hallucination in Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs)** [kuan20249pm] was systematically investigated for the first time, introducing discriminative and generative tasks and novel metrics (ECHO, Cover). This work revealed that LALMs often struggle with understanding discriminative queries despite strong audio comprehension. Extending to dynamic content, **VideoHallucer** [wang2024rta] introduced the first comprehensive benchmark for **Large Video-Language Models (LVLMs)**, with a novel taxonomy categorizing intrinsic (object-relation, temporal, semantic detail) and extrinsic hallucinations, evaluated via adversarial binary VideoQA. The most complex interaction is addressed by **AVHBench** [sungbin2024r2g], the first benchmark for **cross-modal driven hallucinations** in Audio-Visual LLMs, evaluating misinterpretations arising from subtle relationships between audio and visual signals, even using synthetic videos with swapped audio to test discernment.\n\n**New Trend 4: Hallucination Dynamics and Robustness Analysis**\n\nBeyond static detection and mitigation, the field is now investigating the dynamic behavior of hallucinations and the robustness of models against targeted attacks. This represents a crucial step towards building truly resilient AI systems.\n\n**Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing** [zhong2024mfi] identified a novel phenomenon where LVLMs' own previously generated hallucinations can mislead subsequent responses in conversational contexts. The **MMHalSnowball framework** was proposed for evaluation, along with **Residual Visual Decoding (RVD)** as a training-free mitigation strategy. Concurrently, **Mirage in the Eyes** [wang2025jen] introduced a novel **hallucination attack** on MLLMs by exploiting the \"attention sink\" phenomenon. This attack dynamically manipulates attention scores and hidden embeddings to induce erroneous content, demonstrating a new vulnerability and highlighting the need for robust defenses against such sophisticated attacks.\n\n**Refined Synthesis:**\nThe unified intellectual trajectory connecting all these works is a relentless, multi-faceted pursuit of understanding, evaluating, and mitigating the complex phenomenon of hallucination across the rapidly expanding landscape of large AI models. The field has matured from initial object-level detection to diagnosing entangled multimodal reasoning failures, addressing general LLM factual inconsistencies, and now, critically, to understanding hallucination dynamics, cross-modal interactions, and even the quality of evaluation itself. This expanded view highlights a collective contribution towards establishing increasingly robust and nuanced evaluation benchmarks, a deeper causal and mechanistic understanding of hallucination's origins, and the development of a diverse array of practical, efficient, and interpretable mitigation strategies, all vital for advancing the reliability and trustworthiness of AI systems in an increasingly multimodal world.\n\n---\n**Total Number of Papers:** 30",

        "title": "Evaluating Object Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models",
        "abstract": "Inspired by the superior language abilities of large language models (LLM), large vision-language models (LVLM) have been recently explored by integrating powerful LLMs for improving the performance on complex multimodal tasks. Despite the promising progress on LVLMs, we find that LVLMs suffer from the hallucination problem, i.e. they tend to generate objects that are inconsistent with the target images in the descriptions. To investigate it, this work presents the first systematic study on object hallucination of LVLMs. We conduct the evaluation experiments on several representative LVLMs, and show that they mostly suffer from severe object hallucination issue. We further discuss that the visual instructions may influence the hallucination, and find that: objects that frequently occur in the visual instructions or co-occur with the image objects, are obviously prone to be hallucinated by LVLMs. Besides, we find that existing evaluation methods might be affected by the input instructions and generation styles of LVLMs. Thus, we further design an improved evaluation method for object hallucination by proposing a polling-based query method called POPE. Experiment results demonstrate that our POPE can evaluate the object hallucination in a more stable and flexible way. Our codes and data are publicly available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/POPE.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) suffer from \"object hallucination,\" where they generate descriptions containing objects inconsistent with or absent from the target images.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge**: This problem degrades model performance and harms user experience, posing significant risks in real-world applications (e.g., autonomous driving safety). Existing evaluation methods like CHAIR are unstable, sensitive to instruction design, and biased, making it difficult to accurately assess and understand hallucination in LVLMs.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Builds upon the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Pre-trained Models (VLPMs), which are integrated to form LVLMs. Acknowledges that both LLMs (text hallucination) and VLPMs (object hallucination) have shown hallucination tendencies.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   The widely used CHAIR (Caption Hallucination Assessment with Image Relevance) metric is shown to be unstable, highly sensitive to instruction phrasing, and influenced by caption length.\n        *   CHAIR relies on complex, human-crafted parsing rules for object extraction, which may not adapt well to the diverse generation styles of LVLMs and can lead to misclassification errors.\n        *   Previous work lacked a systematic study of object hallucination specifically in LVLMs.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**:\n        *   Conducts the first systematic empirical study of object hallucination in representative LVLMs using the CHAIR metric as a baseline.\n        *   Proposes **Polling-based Object Probing Evaluation (POPE)**, a novel method that converts hallucination evaluation into a binary classification task by prompting LVLMs with simple \"Yes-or-No\" questions about probing objects (e.g., \"Is there a car in the image?\").\n        *   Investigates the influence of visual instruction data, hypothesizing that LVLMs are prone to hallucinate objects that frequently appear or co-occur in their training datasets.\n        *   POPE incorporates different object sampling strategies: \"Random,\" \"Popular\" (sampling frequently appearing/co-occurring objects), and \"Adversarial\" (sampling objects that are visually similar or semantically related but absent).\n    *   **Novelty**:\n        *   Presents the first systematic and comprehensive empirical study of object hallucination in LVLMs.\n        *   Introduces POPE as a more stable, flexible, and scalable evaluation method for object hallucination, overcoming the limitations of traditional caption-based metrics.\n        *   Identifies and quantitatively validates the role of object frequency and co-occurrence in visual instruction datasets as a significant driver of object hallucination in LVLMs.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions** \\cite{li2023249}\n    *   **Novel Evaluation Method**: Introduction of POPE, a polling-based approach that reframes object hallucination assessment as a binary classification task, offering enhanced stability and flexibility compared to existing methods.\n    *   **Empirical Study**: The first systematic empirical study demonstrating the severe prevalence of object hallucination in state-of-the-art LVLMs, often exceeding that of smaller vision-language models.\n    *   **Identification of Hallucination Drivers**: Quantitative and qualitative analysis revealing that LVLMs are significantly prone to hallucinate objects that frequently appear or co-occur within their visual instruction datasets.\n    *   **Scalability and Flexibility**: POPE's design allows for easy extension to unannotated datasets by leveraging automatic segmentation tools (e.g., SEEM), broadening its applicability.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation** \\cite{li2023249}\n    *   **Models Evaluated**: Five representative LVLMs (mPLUG-Owl, LLaVA, MultiModal-GPT, MiniGPT-4, InstructBLIP) and four smaller VLPMs (OSCAR Base, VinVL Large, OFA Large, BLIP Large) for comparison.\n    *   **Datasets**: MSCOCO dataset was used for evaluating hallucination and analyzing object frequencies.\n    *   **Metrics**:\n        *   CHAIR I (instance-level) and CHAIR S (sentence-level) were used for initial evaluation and to highlight their limitations.\n        *   HR@k (Hit Ratio at k), specifically HRA@k (for appearing frequency) and HRC@k (for co-occurring frequency), was introduced to quantify the correlation between object frequency/co-occurrence and hallucination times.\n        *   POPE's performance is implicitly measured by its ability to stably and flexibly evaluate hallucination through \"Yes/No\" responses.\n    *   **Key Results**:\n        *   Most LVLMs exhibit severe object hallucination, with some (e.g., LLaVA) showing significantly higher CHAIR S scores (32.7) than smaller VLPMs (e.g., OSCAR base at 13.0).\n        *   CHAIR metrics were shown to be unstable, with results varying significantly based on minor instruction changes (e.g., Instruction 2 doubling CHAIR values compared to Instruction 1).\n        *   Qualitative (bar charts) and quantitative (HR@k) analyses confirmed that approximately half of hallucinated objects belong to the top 10 frequently appearing COCO objects (HRA@10 near 0.5), and more than half are among the top 10 frequently co-occurring objects (HRC@10 near 0.6).\n        *   POPE demonstrated superior stability and flexibility in evaluating object hallucination compared to CHAIR.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope** \\cite{li2023249}\n    *   **CHAIR Limitations**: The paper explicitly highlights the instability, instruction sensitivity, caption length bias, and reliance on complex parsing rules of the CHAIR metric.\n    *   **POPE Scope**: The current study focuses on coarse-grained object hallucinations (presence/absence of objects) and leaves fine-grained hallucinations (e.g., number, attributes, positions of objects) for future work.\n    *   **Assumptions**: The analysis of hallucination drivers assumes that the object distributions in visual instruction datasets directly influence LVLM's hallucination tendencies.\n\n*   **Technical Significance** \\cite{li2023249}\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art**: Provides the first systematic investigation into object hallucination in LVLMs and introduces POPE, a more robust and practical evaluation methodology.\n    *   **Potential Impact**:\n        *   Highlights a critical safety and reliability concern for the deployment of LVLMs in sensitive real-world applications.\n        *   Offers crucial insights into the underlying mechanisms of hallucination in LVLMs, specifically linking it to the statistical properties (frequency and co-occurrence) of training data.\n        *   POPE establishes a new, stable benchmark for future research, enabling more accurate comparison of LVLMs and fostering the development of effective mitigation strategies against object hallucination.\n        *   Encourages further research into fine-grained hallucination and methods to de-bias LVLMs from generating common but absent objects.",

        "abstract": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in understanding visual information with human languages. However, LVLMs still suffer from object hallucination, which is the problem of generating descriptions that include objects that do not actually exist in the images. This can negatively impact many vision-language tasks, such as visual summarization and reasoning. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet powerful algorithm, LVLM Hallucination Revisor (LURE), to post-hoc rectify object hallucination in LVLMs by reconstructing less hallucinatory descriptions. LURE is grounded in a rigorous statistical analysis of the key factors underlying object hallucination, including co-occurrence (the frequent appearance of certain objects alongside others in images), uncertainty (objects with higher uncertainty during LVLM decoding), and object position (hallucination often appears in the later part of the generated text). LURE can also be seamlessly integrated with any LVLMs. We evaluate LURE on six open-source LVLMs, achieving a 23% improvement in general object hallucination evaluation metrics over the previous best approach. In both GPT and human evaluations, LURE consistently ranks at the top. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/YiyangZhou/LURE.",

        "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently achieved remarkable success. However, LVLMs are still plagued by the hallucination problem, which limits the practicality in many scenarios. Hallucination refers to the information of LVLMs' responses that does not exist in the visual input, which poses potential risks of substantial consequences. There has been limited work studying hallucination evaluation in LVLMs. In this paper, we propose Hallucination Evaluation based on Large Language Models (HaELM), an LLM-based hallucination evaluation framework. HaELM achieves an approximate 95% performance comparable to ChatGPT and has additional advantages including low cost, reproducibility, privacy preservation and local deployment. Leveraging the HaELM, we evaluate the hallucination in current LVLMs. Furthermore, we analyze the factors contributing to hallucination in LVLMs and offer helpful suggestions to mitigate the hallucination problem. Our training data and human annotation hallucination data will be made public soon.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review, emphasizing technical innovations and empirical validation:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the critical issue of \"hallucination\" in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where models generate information that does not exist in the visual input.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: Hallucination limits the practical applicability of LVLMs and poses significant risks due to potentially misleading or incorrect information. Existing evaluation methods, particularly object-based approaches like POPE \\cite{wang2023zop}, are shown to be highly susceptible to prompt bias, leading to inaccurate assessments that do not reflect real-world hallucination behavior. The complexity of LVLM responses in real-world scenarios also makes traditional match-based evaluation methods inadequate.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: The work directly critiques and positions itself against prior object-based hallucination evaluation frameworks (e.g., POPE \\cite{wang2023zop}).\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Previous methods are demonstrated to exploit LVLMs' judgment bias (e.g., answering \"yes\" to over 80% of queries about non-existent objects when prompted with \"Is there a {object}?\"), rather than accurately measuring actual hallucination in descriptive contexts (where less than 10% hallucination was observed for the same items).

Simulated hallucination data is created by crafting prompts for ChatGPT to generate responses based on reference captions, iteratively refined through human similarity assessment to align with realistic hallucination patterns. Non-hallucination data is generated by ChatGPT strictly adhering to reference captions.\n        3.  **Model Training**: Fine-tuning an open-source LLM (LLaMA \\cite{wang2023zop}) using the LoRA-based methodology \\cite{wang2023zop} on the collected data.

        "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced considerably, intertwining visual recognition and language understanding to generate content that is not only coherent but also contextually attuned. Despite their success, LVLMs still suffer from the issue of object hallucinations, where models generate plausible yet incorrect outputs that include objects that do not exist in the images. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Visual Contrastive Decoding (VCD), a simple and training-free method that contrasts output distributions derived from original and distorted visual inputs. The proposed VCD effectively reduces the over-reliance on statistical bias and unimodal priors, two essential causes of object hallucinations. This adjustment ensures the generated content is closely grounded to visual inputs, resulting in contextually accurate outputs. Our experiments show that VCD, without either additional training or the usage of external tools, significantly mitigates the object hallucination issue across different LVLM families. Beyond mitigating object hallucinations, VCD also excels in general LVLM benchmarks, highlighting its wide-ranging applicability.",

This acts as a corrective mechanism to calibrate the model's over-reliance on language priors and statistical biases.\n    *   **Introduction of Visual Uncertainty**: Visual uncertainty is introduced by applying a Gaussian noise mask to the original image, following a forward diffusion process. This creates a distorted image `v'` from the original `v`.\n    *   **Mechanism of Amplification**: The paper empirically demonstrates that increased visual uncertainty (via distortion) amplifies LVLMs' reliance on language priors (e.g., favoring \"yellow\" for a banana even if it's black in a distorted image) and statistical biases (e.g., hallucinating frequent or co-occurring objects more often).\n    *   **Contrastive Probability Distribution**: The core of VCD is defined by:\n        `pvcd(y|v, v′, x) = softmax [(1 + α) logitθ(y|v, x) − α logitθ(y|v′, x)]`\n        where `α` controls the strength of the contrast, and `v'` is the distorted visual input. This formulation penalizes tokens that are highly probable under the distorted input (which is prone to hallucinations) relative to the original input.\n    *   **Adaptive Plausibility Constraints**: To prevent VCD from inadvertently promoting implausible tokens by indiscriminately penalizing all outputs from distorted inputs, an adaptive plausibility constraint is applied. This constraint prunes the candidate token pool `Vhead(y<t)` based on the confidence level of the output distribution with original visual inputs, ensuring only high-probability tokens are considered.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **In-depth Analysis**: Conducted an analysis demonstrating how visual uncertainty amplifies object hallucinations in LVLMs, specifically due to statistical bias and unimodal priors.\n    *   **Novel Training-Free Technique (VCD)**: Designed Visual Contrastive Decoding, a novel method that effectively mitigates object hallucinations by contrasting output distributions from original and distorted visual inputs, without requiring additional training or external models.\n    *   **Adaptive Plausibility Constraint**: Introduced an adaptive plausibility constraint to refine VCD, preventing the generation of implausible tokens and maintaining output integrity.\n    *   **Empirical Validation**: Demonstrated VCD's efficacy in alleviating object hallucination and enhancing general perception capabilities across various LVLM families.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Datasets**:\n        *   **POPE (Polling-based Object Probing Evaluation)** \\cite{leng2023ohr}: Assesses object hallucination by querying LVLMs on object existence.

In order to mitigate hallucinations, existing studies mainly resort to an instruction-tuning manner that requires retraining the models with specific data. In this paper, we pave a different way, introducing a training-free method named Woodpecker. Like a woodpecker heals trees, it picks out and corrects hallucinations from the generated text. Concretely, Woodpecker consists of five stages: key concept extraction, question formulation, visual knowledge validation, visual claim generation, and hallucination correction. Implemented in a post-remedy manner, Woodpecker can easily serve different MLLMs, while being interpretable by accessing intermediate outputs of the five stages. We evaluate Woodpecker both quantitatively and qualitatively and show the huge potential of this new paradigm.

This phenomenon poses a substantial challenge to the reliability of LLMs in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we survey recent efforts on the detection, explanation, and mitigation of hallucination, with an emphasis on the unique challenges posed by LLMs. We present taxonomies of the LLM hallucination phenomena and evaluation benchmarks, analyze existing approaches aiming at mitigating LLM hallucination, and discuss potential directions for future research.",

The problem is particularly challenging for LLMs due to:\n        *   **Massive training data:** Pre-training on web-scale data often includes fabricated, outdated, or biased information, making it difficult to eliminate sources of hallucination \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n        *   **Versatility of LLMs:** Their general-purpose nature across tasks, languages, and domains complicates comprehensive evaluation and robust mitigation strategies \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n        *   **Imperceptibility of errors:** LLMs can generate highly plausible, yet false, information that is difficult for both models and humans to detect \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n        *   Additional factors like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), vague knowledge boundaries, and the black-box nature of LLMs further complicate detection, explanation, and mitigation \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **How does this work relate to existing approaches?**\n        While hallucination has been extensively studied in conventional Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks, this survey specifically focuses on the *unique and amplified challenges* presented by LLMs \\cite{zhang2023k1j}. It positions itself as a comprehensive review of recent efforts tailored to the LLM era.\n    *   **What are the limitations of previous solutions?**\n        Previous studies on hallucination in traditional NLG are often task-specific and do not adequately address the complexities arising from LLMs' massive scale, versatility, and the subtle nature of their errors \\cite{zhang2023k1j}. The paper highlights that while input- and context-conflicting hallucinations were previously explored, *fact-conflicting hallucination* in LLMs poses more complex challenges due to the absence of an authoritative knowledge source and its greater practical impact \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **What is the core technical method or algorithm?**\n        As a survey, the core technical approach is a systematic and comprehensive review and structured analysis of the current landscape of LLM hallucination research \\cite{zhang2023k1j}. This involves:\n        *   Defining and categorizing LLM hallucination into three distinct types: input-conflicting, context-conflicting, and fact-conflicting \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n        *   Presenting taxonomies of hallucination phenomena and evaluation benchmarks.\n        *   Analyzing potential sources of hallucination and reviewing existing mitigation approaches across the LLM lifecycle (pre-training, SFT, RLHF, inference) \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n        *   Discussing future research directions.\n    *   **What makes this approach novel or different?**\n        The novelty lies in providing a timely, structured, and LLM-centric overview of hallucination, emphasizing the unique challenges and the predominant research focus on fact-conflicting hallucinations \\cite{zhang2023k1j}. It offers a systematic framework for understanding and addressing this critical problem, clearly distinguishing it from other LLM issues like ambiguity or incompleteness \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel algorithms, methods, or techniques:**\n        *   A clear and expanded **taxonomy of LLM hallucination**, categorizing it into Input-conflicting, Context-conflicting, and Fact-conflicting types, complete with illustrative examples \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n        *   An analytical framework that explores the **sources of LLM hallucinations** and systematically reviews **mitigation strategies** throughout the LLM lifecycle (pre-training, supervised finetuning (SFT), reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and inference) \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n        *   Detailed identification and discussion of the **unique challenges** of hallucination in the LLM era, including issues related to massive training data, model versatility, and the imperceptibility of errors \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n    *   **System design or architectural innovations:** Not applicable as this is a survey paper.\n    *   **Theoretical insights or analysis:** The paper provides a conceptual framework for understanding the multifaceted nature of LLM hallucination and its distinction from other LLM problems \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.

It categorizes these benchmarks according to the defined hallucination types, such as Input-conflicting Benchmarks (e.g., BEGIN, QMSum), Context-conflicting Benchmarks (e.g., HADES), and Fact-conflicting Benchmarks (e.g., TruthfulQA, FActScore, HaluEval, FACTOR) \\cite{zhang2023k1j}. This provides a crucial overview of the empirical landscape for future research.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical limitations or assumptions:**\n        The survey primarily concentrates on **fact-conflicting hallucinations**, acknowledging that input- and context-conflicting types have been extensively studied in conventional NLG and are particularly prone to occur in long-context scenarios involving LLMs \\cite{zhang2023k1j}. It also notes the ongoing debate regarding the classification of unverifiable content as hallucination \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n    *   **Scope of applicability:**\n        The survey focuses on hallucination specifically within the context of Large Language Models, addressing challenges arising from their scale, versatility, and training paradigms \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.

It synthesizes diverse research efforts, clarifies definitions, and structures the problem space, which is crucial for a rapidly evolving field. By distinguishing hallucination from other LLM issues, it refines the understanding of LLM failures \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.\n    *   **Potential impact on future research:**\n        The paper's taxonomies, analysis of sources and mitigation strategies, and discussion of unique challenges provide a foundational roadmap for future research \\cite{zhang2023k1j}. It explicitly points out future research directions and encourages further discourse on complex issues like unverifiable content, thereby guiding researchers toward critical unsolved problems in improving LLM reliability and trustworthiness \\cite{zhang2023k1j}.

        "abstract": "Hallucination, posed as a pervasive challenge of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), has significantly impeded their real-world usage that demands precise judgment. Existing methods mitigate this issue with either training with specific designed data or inferencing with external knowledge from other sources, incurring inevitable additional costs. In this paper, we present OPERA, a novel MLLM decoding method grounded in an Over-trust Penalty and a Retrospection-Allocation strategy, serving as a nearly free lunch to alleviate the hallucination issue without additional data, knowledge, or training. Our approach begins with an interesting observation that, most hallucinations are closely tied to the knowledge aggregation patterns manifested in the self-attention matrix, i.e., MLLMs tend to generate new tokens by focusing on a few summary tokens, but not all the previous tokens. Such partial overtrust inclination results in the neglecting of image tokens and describes the image content with hallucination. Based on the observation, OPERA introduces a penalty term on the model logits during the beam-search decoding to mitigate the over-trust issue, along with a rollback strategy that retrospects the presence of summary tokens in the previously generated tokens, and re-allocate the token selection if necessary. With extensive experiments, OPERA shows significant hallucination-mitigating performance on different MLLMs and metrics, proving its effectiveness and generality.

        "abstract": "Despite the outstanding performance in vision-language reasoning, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) might generate hallucinated contents that do not exist in the given image. Most existing LVLM hallucination benchmarks are constrained to evaluate the object-related hallucinations. However, the potential hallucination on the relations between two objects, i.e., relation hallucination, still lacks investigation. To remedy that, we design a unified framework to measure the object and relation hallucination in LVLMs simultaneously. The core idea of our framework is to evaluate hallucinations via (object, relation, object) triplets extracted from LVLMs'responses, making it easily generalizable to different vision-language tasks. Based on our framework, we further introduce Tri-HE, a novel Triplet-level Hallucination Evaluation benchmark which can be used to study both object and relation hallucination at the same time. With comprehensive evaluations on Tri-HE, we observe that the relation hallucination issue is even more serious than object hallucination among existing LVLMs, highlighting a previously neglected problem towards reliable LVLMs. Moreover, based on our findings, we design a simple training-free approach that effectively mitigates hallucinations for LVLMs. Our dataset and code for the reproduction of our experiments are available publicly at https://github.com/wujunjie1998/Tri-HE.",
        "summary": "This paper \\cite{wu20241us} introduces a novel framework and benchmark for evaluating hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), with a particular focus on previously underexplored relation hallucinations.\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Existing LVLM hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on *object-related* hallucinations, neglecting the critical issue of *relation hallucination* (where LVLMs correctly identify objects but misrepresent their relationships).\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: Hallucinations severely impact the reliability of LVLMs. Relation hallucination is shown to be a more severe and previously overlooked problem. Current evaluation methods are often biased (e.g., requiring short \"Yes/No\" answers) or limited in applicability, failing to provide a unified, fine-grained, and unbiased assessment across diverse vision-language tasks.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Previous works either solely evaluate object hallucinations or use \"yes/no\" questions for both object and relation types.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   **Incompleteness**: Neglect other hallucination types like relation hallucination, leading to non-comprehensive evaluations.\n        *   **Bias**: Methods requiring short answers (e.g., \"Yes/No\" or template-driven like \"What is the relation between A and B?\") introduce bias due to varying LVLM capabilities in generating brief responses, inflating performance for some models.\n        *   **Limited Applicability**: These benchmarks often require transforming general vision-language tasks into specific formats, restricting their generalizability.\n        *   **Discriminator Limitations**: Concurrent work like Reefknot \\cite{zheng2024reef} uses simpler template-based questions and a single entailment-based discriminator, limiting task variety, response length, and the comprehensiveness of hallucination identification.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes a unified framework that evaluates hallucinations via **(object, relation, object) triplets** extracted from LVLM responses.\n        *   **Definitions**: Clearly defines object hallucination (object not in image), relation hallucination (objects in image, but relation not), and distinguishes them from prediction errors.\n        *   **Evaluation Metrics**: Introduces **question-level (Hallu Q)** and **image-level (Hallu I)** hallucination rates, calculated as the proportion of hallucinated triplets, ensuring comparability across different LVLMs.\n        *   **Pipeline**:\n            1.  **Knowledge Graph Extraction**: Uses GPT-4 to extract triplets from LVLM-generated responses.\n            2.  **Hallucination Judgment**: Employs two strategies:\n                *   **NLI Judge**: A Natural Language Inference model compares extracted triplets with ground truth scene graph triplets based on similarity and NLI scores.\n                *   **LLM Judge**: A powerful LLM (GPT-4) determines if an extracted triplet can be directly obtained or inferred from the image's scene graph. It further clarifies if the hallucination is object- or relation-specific.\n    *   **Novelty/Differentiation**:\n        *   **Unified Triplet-Level Evaluation**: First framework to simultaneously and explicitly measure both object and relation hallucinations at a fine-grained triplet level, generalizable across diverse vision-language tasks.\n        *   **Unbiased Metrics**: Addresses the comparability issue of previous metrics by normalizing hallucination rates at question and image levels.\n        *   **Robust Judge**: Leverages powerful LLMs (GPT-4) for accurate and nuanced hallucination discrimination, demonstrating high alignment with human judgment, and distinguishing it from simpler NLI or entailment-based methods.\n        *   **Task-Agnostic Design**: The framework is designed to be applicable to any vision-language task, provided scene graph annotations are available.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Framework**: A unified triplet-level hallucination evaluation framework capable of jointly assessing object and relation hallucinations in LVLM responses across diverse vision-language tasks.\n    *   **Novel Benchmark (Tri-HE)**: Introduction of Tri-HE, a fine-grained triplet-level hallucination evaluation benchmark specifically designed for LVLMs, constructed from GQA images with GPT-4V generated questions, answers, and refined scene graphs.\n    *   **Training-Free Mitigation Approach**: A simple yet effective training-free method that mitigates hallucinations by explicitly incorporating scene graph triplets into LVLM prompts.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**:\n        *   Comprehensive evaluation of various open-source (LLaVA, LLaVA-1.5, MiniGPT-4, InstructBLIP, Shikra, InternLM2) and closed-source (GPT-4V) LVLMs on the Tri-HE benchmark.\n        *   Ablation studies comparing human vs. LLM judge agreement and NLI vs. LLM judge performance.\n        *   Validation of the proposed training-free hallucination mitigation approach.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**: Hallu Q and Hallu I (overall, object, and relation hallucination rates).\n    *   **Comparison Results**:\n        *   **Severity of Relation Hallucination**: Experiments consistently show that relation hallucination is *more severe* than object hallucination across all evaluated LVLMs, highlighting a critical, previously neglected problem.\n        *   **Model Performance**: GPT-4V generally exhibits the lowest hallucination rates but still suffers from relation hallucination. Open-source models like LLaVA-1.5 and InternLM2 perform relatively well.\n        *   **Judge Reliability**: The LLM judge (GPT-4) demonstrates high agreement with human judgments (80.2% for object, 78.5% for relation), outperforming the NLI judge. LLaMA-3.3 also shows comparable performance as a judge.\n        *   **Mitigation Effectiveness**: The proposed training-free mitigation method significantly reduces both object and relation hallucinations across various LVLMs, outperforming existing open-source competitors without mitigation.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The framework relies on the availability of scene graph annotations for test images or the ability to extract them using pre-trained expert models. The effectiveness of the LLM judge depends on the capabilities of the underlying LLM (e.g., GPT-4).\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: While formulated primarily for VQA tasks, the framework is designed to be task-agnostic and generalizable to any natural-language-based vision-language task, provided scene graph information is available. Detailed exploration for other tasks is left for future work.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: This work significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in LVLM reliability by providing the first unified, fine-grained evaluation framework for both object and relation hallucinations. It uncovers relation hallucination as a major, previously underestimated challenge.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n        *   **New Research Direction**: Highlights the critical need for LVLM research to address relation hallucination, moving beyond just object-level issues.\n        *   **Improved Evaluation**: Provides a robust, unbiased, and generalizable benchmark (Tri-HE) and evaluation methodology that can be adopted for future LVLM development and comparison.\n        *   **Mitigation Strategies**: The simple yet effective training-free mitigation approach offers a practical baseline and motivates further research into more advanced hallucination reduction techniques.\n        *   **Foundation for Reliability**: Lays a foundation for building more reliable and trustworthy LVLMs by enabling a deeper understanding and measurement of different hallucination types.",

        "abstract": "The advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has increasingly highlighted the critical issue of their tendency to hallucinate non-existing objects in the images. To address this issue, previous works focused on using specially curated datasets or powerful LLMs to rectify the outputs of LVLMs. However, these approaches require either costly training or fine-tuning, or API access to proprietary LLMs for post-generation correction. In response to these limitations, we propose Mitigating hallucinAtion via image-gRounded guIdaNcE (MARINE), a framework that is both training-free and API-free. MARINE effectively and efficiently reduces object hallucinations during inference by introducing image-grounded guidance to LVLMs. This is achieved by leveraging open-source vision models to extract object-level information, thereby enhancing the precision of LVLM-generated content. Our framework's flexibility further allows for the integration of multiple vision models, enabling more reliable and robust object-level guidance. Through comprehensive evaluations across 5 popular LVLMs with diverse evaluation metrics and benchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MARINE, which even outperforms existing fine-tuning-based methods. Remarkably, it reduces hallucinations consistently in GPT-4V-assisted evaluation while maintaining the detailedness of LVLMs' generations.

Existing solutions often require costly training/fine-tuning, extensive human annotation, or reliance on proprietary LLM APIs for post-generation correction, which are often infeasible, expensive, and raise privacy concerns. Furthermore, these prior methods often do not address the intrinsic causes of hallucination within LVLMs.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches**: Previous efforts include fine-tuning LVLMs with specially curated datasets (e.g., Liu et al., 2023a;b), leveraging powerful LLMs like GPT-4 for post-processing (e.g., Yin et al., 2023), Visual Contrastive Decoding (VCD) which penalizes logit outputs of corrupted images (Leng et al., 2023), and enhanced beam-search decoding with over-trust penalties (OPERA) (Huang et al., 2023a). HALC (Chen et al., 2024) uses adaptive focal-contrast decoding, and BRAVE (Kar et al., 2024) combines features from multiple vision encoders.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   **Costly & Infeasible**: Fine-tuning requires significant computational resources and human annotation for high-quality datasets.\n        *   **API Dependence & Privacy**: GPT-assisted methods are expensive and raise privacy concerns.\n        *   **Intrinsic Causes Unaddressed**: Many approaches do not tackle the root causes of hallucination, which stem from insufficient visual context from encoders or information distortion during vision-to-text projection.\n        *   **Computational Overhead**: Some methods like HALC use computationally intensive beam search.\n    *   **Positioning**: \\cite{zhao2024ge8} introduces MARINE as a novel, training-free, and API-free framework that addresses object hallucination during inference by targeting its intrinsic causes (deficiencies in visual encoding and cross-modal information distortion) through image-grounded guidance.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: MARINE (Mitigating hallucin Ation via image-g Rounded guIdaNcE) introduces image-grounded guidance to LVLMs during inference. It operates in two main steps:\n        1.  **Visual Guidance from Image-Grounded Features**: Leverages open-source, specialized vision models (e.g., object detection models like DETR and RAM++) to extract detailed, object-level visual information from the input image. This information is aggregated (potentially by a small language model or rule-based algorithm) and translated into a textual \"guidance prompt\" (e.g., \"focusing on the visible objects in this image: [aggregated object info]\").\n        2.  **Guided Text Generation**: Integrates this guidance prompt (`c`) into the LVLM's generation process using a classifier-free guidance mechanism in the logit space. The output token `yt` is sampled from a linearly combined logit space: `log p_guided(yt) = γ * log p_conditional(yt) + (1 - γ) * log p_unconditional(yt)`. Here, `p_conditional` is the generation conditioned on the original visual tokens, textual prompt, *and* the guidance prompt `c`, while `p_unconditional` is conditioned only on the original visual tokens and textual prompt.\n    *   **Novelty & Differentiation**:\n        *   **Training-Free & API-Free**: Unlike most prior work, MARINE requires no additional training or fine-tuning of the LVLM and no access to proprietary LLM APIs.\n        *   **Addresses Intrinsic Causes**: Directly tackles hallucination arising from insufficient visual context and information distortion by enriching the visual input with fine-grained, externally derived object information.\n        *   **Flexible Integration**: Allows for the integration and aggregation of multiple open-source vision models, enhancing robustness and reliability.\n        *   **Inference-Time Control**: Applies guidance directly during the decoding process, offering real-time control over generation.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Framework (MARINE)**: A universal, training-free, and API-free framework for mitigating object hallucination in LVLMs.\n    *   **Image-Grounded Guidance Mechanism**: Introduces a method to leverage external, specialized vision models to provide detailed object-level information, which is then converted into textual guidance.\n    *   **Logit-Space Guidance for LVLMs**: Adapts classifier-free guidance to the multi-modal context of LVLMs, allowing for controllable generation by balancing original LVLM output with image-grounded guidance.\n    *   **Aggregation of Multiple Vision Models**: Demonstrates the ability to aggregate information from diverse vision models (e.g., DETR, RAM++) for more robust guidance.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Comprehensive evaluations were performed across 5 popular LVLMs (LLaVA, LLaVA-v1.5, MiniGPT-v2, mPLUG-Owl2, InstructBLIP) using guidance from DETR and RAM++.\n    *   **Benchmarks & Metrics**:\n        *   **Image Captioning**: CHAIR-I (instance-level hallucination), CHAIR-S (sentence-level hallucination), and Recall (inclusion of existing objects) on MSCOCO.\n        *   **Visual Question Answering (VQA)**: POPE (Polling-based Object Probing Evaluation) in adversarial settings (accuracy, F1, \"yes\" answer proportion) on LLaVA-QA90, A-OKVQA, and GQA.\n        *   **Qualitative Evaluation**: GPT-4V-aided evaluation for overall quality and hallucination assessment.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results**:\n        *   **Hallucination Reduction**: MARINE consistently and significantly reduces object hallucinations across all evaluated LVLMs and benchmarks, as measured by CHAIR-I, CHAIR-S, and POPE.\n        *   **Outperforms Baselines**: Achieves superior hallucination mitigation compared to state-of-the-art methods, including existing fine-tuning-based approaches.\n        *   **Maintains Detailedness**: While reducing hallucination, MARINE effectively maintains the detailedness and overall performance of LVLMs' generations (e.g., high Recall scores).\n        *   **Efficiency**: Provides a favorable trade-off between latency and accuracy, demonstrating the lowest computational overhead compared to existing baselines, making it a practical and scalable solution.\n        *   **GPT-4V Evaluation**: Consistently reduces hallucinations in GPT-4V-assisted evaluations.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**: While addressing visual encoder and cross-modal projection issues, MARINE does not directly tackle \"inherent hallucinations common in general language models\" (i.e., language-prior-driven hallucinations). The effectiveness is dependent on the quality and coverage of the external vision models used for guidance.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: Primarily designed for inference-time mitigation of object hallucination in LVLMs. It is training-free and API-free, making it broadly applicable to existing LVLMs without requiring architectural changes or retraining.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art**: \\cite{zhao2024ge8} presents the first training-free and API-free framework that effectively mitigates object hallucination in LVLMs during inference, directly addressing intrinsic causes related to visual information processing.\n    *   **Practical & Scalable Solution**: Its low computational overhead and independence from costly training or proprietary APIs make it a highly practical and scalable solution for real-world LVLM deployments.\n    *   **Impact on Future Research**: Opens new avenues for research into inference-time guidance mechanisms for multimodal models, potentially inspiring similar approaches to address other LVLM deficiencies without extensive retraining.

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capability in visual information understanding with human language. Despite these advances, LVLMs still face challenges with multimodal hallucination, such as generating text descriptions of objects that are not present in the visual information. However, the underlying fundamental reasons of multimodal hallucinations remain poorly explored. In this paper, we propose a new perspective, suggesting that the inherent biases in LVLMs might be a key factor in hallucinations. Specifically, we systematically identify a semantic shift bias related to paragraph breaks (\\n\\n), where the content before and after '\\n\\n' in the training data frequently exhibit significant semantic changes. This pattern leads the model to infer that the contents following '\\n\\n' should be obviously different from the preceding contents with less hallucinatory descriptions, thereby increasing the probability of hallucinatory descriptions subsequent to the '\\n\\n'. We have validated this hypothesis on multiple publicly available LVLMs. Besides, we find that deliberately inserting '\\n\\n' at the generated description can induce more hallucinations. A simple method is proposed to effectively mitigate the hallucination of LVLMs by skipping the output of '\\n'.",

Related Work & Positioning**\n\n*   **Relation to Existing Approaches:**\n    *   Existing hallucination mitigation methods are broadly categorized into retraining-based (e.g., redesigning vision encoders, finetuning with high-quality data, reinforcement learning) and post-hoc processing-based (e.g., decoding strategies, reviser models).\n    *   Previous studies have attributed hallucinations to imperfections in vision encoders or inherent model uncertainties.\n*   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n    *   Many existing approaches lack an exploration of the fundamental factors causing LVLM hallucinations.\n    *   Retraining-based methods often incur significant additional computational overhead.\n    *   \\cite{han202439z} distinguishes itself by investigating hallucinations from the perspective of inherent biases within the models, offering a novel angle.\n\n### **3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n\n*   **Core Technical Method/Algorithm:**\n    *   The paper proposes that an inherent \"semantic shift bias\" related to paragraph breaks ('\\n\\n') in training data is a key factor in LVLM hallucinations.\n    *   This bias causes models to infer that content following '\\n\\n' should be semantically different from preceding content, increasing the likelihood of hallucinatory descriptions.\n    *   To mitigate this, two orthogonal methods are proposed to prevent the generation of '\\n\\n':\n        *   **Mitigating Hallucinations during Input (MiHI):** Modifying the input prompt to encourage single-paragraph generation (e.g., adding \"in one paragraph\" to the instruction).\n        *   **Mitigating Hallucinations during Output (MiHO):** Adjusting the decoding strategy by reducing the logits (prediction probability) of the '\\n' token, effectively preventing its generation (by setting a penalty strength λ to positive infinity).\n*   **Novelty/Difference:**\n    *   Identifies and systematically validates a previously unexplored \"semantic shift bias\" linked to paragraph breaks as a root cause of hallucination.\n    *   Introduces simple, efficient, and cost-effective post-hoc methods (prompt engineering and logit manipulation) that do not require model retraining or additional complex architectures.\n    *   Demonstrates that deliberately inserting '\\n\\n' can *induce* hallucinations, further supporting the hypothesis and providing a novel attack mechanism.\n\n### **4. Key Technical Contributions**\n\n*   **Novel Algorithms, Methods, or Techniques:**\n    *   Identification and empirical validation of the \"semantic shift bias\" in LVLMs, where '\\n\\n' tokens trigger increased hallucination rates.\n    *   A method to induce multimodal hallucinations by strategically inserting '\\n\\n' tokens.\n    *   **MiHI:** A prompt engineering technique to reduce hallucinations by encouraging single-paragraph outputs.\n    *   **MiHO:** A decoding strategy modification that suppresses the generation of '\\n' tokens by manipulating output logits.\n*   **Theoretical Insights or Analysis:**\n    *   Hypothesizes that the frequent semantic changes observed around '\\n\\n' in training data lead LVLMs to associate '\\n\\n' with a shift towards potentially less grounded or more divergent content, increasing hallucination probability.\n\n### **5. Experimental Validation**\n\n*   **Experiments Conducted:**\n    *   **Hypothesis Verification (Q1):** Compared hallucination severity in text generated *before* vs. *after* a '\\n' token.\n    *   **Attackability (Q2):** Tested if manually inserting '\\n\\n' at different positions in generated text induces more hallucinations.\n    *   **Effectiveness (Q3):** Evaluated MiHO, MiHI, and their combination against original LVLM outputs.\n    *   **Effectiveness (Q3, Equal Length):** Conducted comparisons at equal output lengths to control for sentence length effects.\n*   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results:**\n    *   **Metrics:** Cs (ratio of hallucinated objects to all mentioned objects) and Ci (ratio of captions with hallucinated objects to all captions). Lower values indicate less hallucination.\n    *   **Models:** Evaluated on six publicly available LVLMs: BakLLaVA, LLaVA-v1.5-7B, LLaVA-v1.5-13B, InstructBLIP-7B, MiniGPT-v2, and Fuyu-8B.\n    *   **Q1 Results:** Content generated *after* '\\n' consistently exhibited significantly higher Cs and Ci across all models and decoding strategies (e.g., for BakLLaVA with greedy decoding, Cs increased from 18.14% before '\\n' to 53.42% after '\\n').\n    *   **Q2 Results:** Inserting '\\n\\n' generally increased hallucination metrics (Cs and Ci), with later insertions often leading to more severe hallucinations (e.g., BakLLaVA with greedy decoding, original Cs=48.56%, Attack-3 Cs=54.54%).\n    *   **Q3 Results (Overall):** MiHO and MiHO+MiHI significantly reduced hallucinations across almost all models. MiHI was also effective but showed less improvement for Fuyu-8B, possibly due to its instruction-tuning limitations.\n    *   **Q3 Results (Equal Length):** MiHO consistently showed significant improvements. MiHI and MiHO+MiHI sometimes exhibited performance decreases, suggesting that modified prompts might negatively impact description quality when forced to equal lengths.\n    *   **Decoding Strategy:** Sampling decoding was found to be more prone to hallucinations than greedy decoding, and the proposed methods performed better with greedy decoding.\n\n### **6. Limitations & Scope**\n\n*   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:**\n    *   The '\\n\\n'-induced hallucination problem is not universal across all LVLMs (e.g., not observed in GPT-4).\n    *   The effectiveness of MiHI can depend on the LVLM's instruction-following capabilities (e.g., less effective for Fuyu-8B).\n    *   Forcing single-paragraph output via MiHI might, in some cases, negatively impact the overall quality or detail of descriptions when controlling for length.\n*   **Scope of Applicability:**\n    *   Primarily focuses on object hallucination in LVLMs.\n    *   The proposed methods are simple, post-hoc interventions applicable to LVLMs exhibiting the identified semantic shift bias, without requiring retraining.\n    *   The paper acknowledges that whether this bias persists or can be overcome with continued model scaling remains an open question.\n\n### **7.

        "abstract": "Although Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated exceptional abilities in understanding multimodal data, they invariably suffer from hallucinations, leading to a disconnect between the generated text and the corresponding images. Almost all current visual contrastive decoding methods attempt to mitigate these hallucinations by introducing visual uncertainty information that appropriately widens the contrastive logits gap between hallucinatory and targeted ones. However, due to uncontrollable nature of the global visual uncertainty, they struggle to precisely induce the hallucinatory tokens, which severely limits their effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and may even lead to the generation of undesired hallucinations. To tackle this issue, we conducted the theoretical analysis to promote the effectiveness of contrast decoding. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel optimization strategy named Hallucination-Induced Optimization (HIO). This strategy seeks to amplify the contrast between hallucinatory and targeted tokens relying on a fine-tuned theoretical preference model (i.e., Contrary Bradley-Terry Model), thereby facilitating efficient contrast decoding to alleviate hallucinations in LVLMs. Extensive experimental research demonstrates that our HIO strategy can effectively reduce hallucinations in LVLMs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks.",

While these models inherit the robust capabilities of foundational Large Language Models (LLMs), they also inherit susceptibility to hallucinations-a significant concern in high-stakes medical contexts where the margin for error is minimal. However, currently, there are no dedicated methods or benchmarks for hallucination detection and evaluation in the medical field. To bridge this gap, we introduce Med-HallMark, the first benchmark specifically designed for hallucination detection and evaluation within the medical multimodal domain. This benchmark provides multi-tasking hallucination support, multifaceted hallucination data, and hierarchical hallucination categorization. Furthermore, we propose the MediHall Score, a new medical evaluative metric designed to assess LVLMs' hallucinations through a hierarchical scoring system that considers the severity and type of hallucination, thereby enabling a granular assessment of potential clinical impacts.

        "title": "VaLiD: Mitigating the Hallucination of Large Vision Language Models by Visual Layer Fusion Contrastive Decoding",
        "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in multimodal task reasoning. However, they often generate responses that appear plausible yet do not accurately reflect the visual content, a phenomenon known as hallucination. Recent approaches have introduced training-free methods to mitigate hallucinations by adjusting the decoding strategy during the inference stage, typically attributing hallucinations to the language model itself. Our analysis, however, reveals that distortions in the visual encoding process significantly affect the model's reasoning capabilities. Specifically, earlier visual layers may retain key features but gradually distort as the information propagates toward the output layer. Building on these insights, we propose a novel hallucination-mitigation method from the visual encoding perspective: \\textbf{V}isu\\textbf{a}l \\textbf{L}ayer Fus\\textbf{i}on Contrastive \\textbf{D}ecoding (\\textbf{VaLiD}).

        "summary": "Here is a focused summary of the paper for a literature review:\n\n### Focused Summary for Literature Review\n\n#### 1. Research Problem & Motivation\n*   **Specific Technical Problem**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) frequently suffer from \"hallucination,\" where they generate plausible but factually incorrect responses that do not align with the visual input \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n*   **Importance and Challenge**: Hallucinations severely undermine the reliability of LVLMs, posing significant barriers to their deployment in real-world applications \\cite{wang2024vym}. Existing inference-stage mitigation methods primarily attribute hallucinations to the language model itself. However, this paper posits that distortions in the visual encoding process are a critical, overlooked source of these errors, making the problem more complex than previously assumed \\cite{wang2024vym}. The paper identifies \"Visual Encoding Distortion,\" where key visual features captured in earlier layers become distorted as they propagate towards the final output layer, leading to incorrect inferences \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n\n#### 2. Related Work & Positioning\n*   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Previous hallucination mitigation methods generally fall into three categories:\n    *   **Post-training steps**: Involve additional training with auxiliary supervision or reinforcement learning, which are computationally expensive and require large annotated datasets \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n    *   **Post-hoc correction**: Utilize auxiliary revision models or manual pipelines during inference, often facing challenges with high computational costs, complex implementation, and limited scalability \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n    *   **Decoding strategy modification**: Intervene during the inference phase by adjusting the decoding strategy, reducing computational costs. However, these methods typically assume the language model is the primary source of hallucinations, focusing on language priors or statistical biases \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n*   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Existing inference-time decoding strategies largely overlook the impact of the visual encoding process on hallucinations \\cite{wang2024vym}. They fail to address the \"Visual Encoding Distortion\" phenomenon, where crucial visual information is corrupted before reaching the language model, leading to errors even with sophisticated decoding strategies focused solely on the language component \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n\n#### 3. Technical Approach & Innovation\n*   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes Visual-Layer Fusion Contrastive Decoding (VaLiD), a novel hallucination mitigation method that addresses distortions from the vision encoder perspective \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n    *   **Uncertainty-guided Visual-Layer Fusion**: VaLiD leverages uncertainty (measured by the entropy of the next token's probability distribution) to identify visual layers where encoding distortion occurs \\cite{wang2024vym}. Instead of relying on a single layer, it dynamically selects and fuses features from the top-k early visual layers exhibiting high uncertainty. This fusion is entropy-weighted to create a robust reference distribution \\cite{wang2024vym}. To ensure computational efficiency, visual layers are partitioned into \"buckets,\" and the optimal bucket is determined via a validation set \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n    *   **Contrastive Decoding**: VaLiD then applies a contrastive decoding approach. It contrasts the next token distribution from the standard visual output layer (Pori) with the fused reference distribution (Pref) derived from the selected early visual layers. This contrastive process generates a corrected probability distribution (Pvalid) that mitigates the adverse effects of inaccurate visual information \\cite{wang2024vym}. An adaptive reliability constraint is also incorporated to prevent penalizing valid outputs and ensure adherence to language standards \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n*   **Novelty**: VaLiD is novel because it is the first visual-centric hallucination mitigation approach that traces the origin of hallucinations to the vision encoder's internal processing \\cite{wang2024vym}. It introduces the concept of \"Visual Encoding Distortion\" and provides a mechanism (uncertainty-guided layer fusion) to identify and correct these distortions by integrating information from multiple visual layers, rather than solely relying on the final visual output or language model adjustments \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n\n#### 4. Key Technical Contributions\n*   **Novel Phenomenon Identification**: Emphasizes the critical role of the vision encoder and identifies \"Visual Encoding Distortion\" as a common phenomenon across different LVLMs, where visual information degrades as it propagates through layers \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n*   **Visual-Centric Mitigation Method**: Introduces VaLiD, the first hallucination mitigation approach that directly addresses issues within the visual encoding process, shifting the focus from solely the language model to the vision encoder \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n*   **Uncertainty-Guided Layer Fusion**: Proposes a novel mechanism for dynamically selecting and fusing visual features from early layers based on their uncertainty, providing a more robust reference for contrastive decoding \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n*   **Enhanced Contrastive Decoding**: Integrates this visual-layer fusion into a contrastive decoding framework, effectively correcting distorted visual information and improving the reliability of generated content \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n\n#### 5. Experimental Validation\n*   **Experiments Conducted**: VaLiD was integrated with three representative LVLMs: InstructBLIP-7B, LLaVA-v1.5-7B, and Qwen-VL-7B \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n*   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n    *   **Benchmarks**: Evaluated on three hallucination benchmarks: POPE (assessing object existence hallucination across MS-COCO, A-OKVQA, GQA datasets), AMBER (fine-grained evaluation of existence, attribute, and relational hallucinations), and MME (comprehensive benchmark covering 14 tasks, with focus on existence, count, location, and color subsets for hallucination assessment) \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n    *   **Metrics**: Accuracy (Acc.), F1-score, and Yes Accuracy (Yes Acc.) for POPE; Acc. and F1 for AMBER; and specific task scores for MME \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n    *   **Comparison**: Compared against baseline methods including Vanilla decoding and other contrastive decoding approaches like VCD, M3ID, and Ritual \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n    *   **Results**: VaLiD consistently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in mitigating hallucinations across various benchmarks and LVLMs. For instance, on POPE, VaLiD generally achieved higher Acc. and F1 scores across all datasets and negative sampling strategies compared to baselines \\cite{wang2024vym}. It effectively reduced object-level and attribute-level hallucinations without compromising the model's general reasoning capabilities on other MME tasks \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n\n#### 6. Limitations & Scope\n*   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The method relies on the assumption that earlier visual layers retain key features that become distorted later, and that uncertainty is a reliable indicator of this distortion \\cite{wang2024vym}. While the paper demonstrates this empirically, the theoretical underpinnings of why uncertainty correlates with distortion could be further explored.\n*   **Scope of Applicability**: VaLiD is designed for LVLMs that utilize Vision Transformers (ViT) as their visual encoder, as it operates by accessing and fusing features from different hidden layers of the ViT backbone \\cite{wang2024vym}. Its direct applicability to LVLMs with fundamentally different visual encoder architectures might require adaptation. The \"bucketing\" strategy for layer selection, while improving efficiency, implies a trade-off that needs careful validation for optimal performance \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n\n#### 7. Technical Significance\n*   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: VaLiD significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in hallucination mitigation by introducing a novel visual-centric perspective, moving beyond language-model-centric approaches \\cite{wang2024vym}. It provides a concrete method to identify and correct visual encoding distortions, a previously underexplored root cause of LVLM hallucinations \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n*   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: This work opens new avenues for research into the internal workings of vision encoders within LVLMs. It suggests that future efforts in improving LVLM reliability should not only focus on language model biases or post-hoc corrections but also on ensuring the integrity of visual information throughout the encoding process. It could inspire further investigations into dynamic layer selection, uncertainty quantification in multimodal models, and more sophisticated visual feature fusion techniques for robust multimodal reasoning \\cite{wang2024vym}.",

        "abstract": "Despite the remarkable ability of large vision-language models (LVLMs) in image comprehension, these models frequently generate plausible yet factually incorrect responses, a phenomenon known as hallucination. Recently, in large language models (LLMs), augmenting LLMs by retrieving information from external knowledge resources has been proven as a promising solution to mitigate hallucinations. However, the retrieval augmentation in LVLM significantly lags behind the widespread applications of LVLM. Moreover, when transferred to augmenting LVLMs, sometimes the hallucination degree of the model is even exacerbated. Motivated by the research gap and counter-intuitive phenomenon, we introduce a novel framework, the Active Retrieval-Augmented large vision-language model (ARA), specifically designed to address hallucinations by incorporating three critical dimensions: (i) dissecting the retrieval targets based on the inherent hierarchical structures of images. (ii) pinpointing the most effective retrieval methods and filtering out the reliable retrieval results. (iii) timing the retrieval process to coincide with episodes of low certainty, while circumventing unnecessary retrieval during periods of high certainty. To assess the capability of our proposed ARA model in reducing hallucination, we employ three widely used LVLM models (LLaVA-1.5, Qwen-VL, and mPLUG-Owl2) across four benchmarks. Our empirical observations suggest that by utilizing fitting retrieval mechanisms and timing the retrieval judiciously, we can effectively mitigate the hallucination problem. We hope that this study can provide deeper insights into how to adapt the retrieval augmentation to LVLMs for reducing hallucinations with more effective retrieval and minimal retrieval occurrences.",

        "abstract": "Fusing visual understanding into language generation, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are revolutionizing visual-language applications. Yet, these models are often plagued by the hallucination problem, which involves generating inaccurate objects, attributes, and relationships that do not match the visual content. In this work, we delve into the internal attention mechanisms of MLLMs to reveal the underlying causes of hallucination, exposing the inherent vulnerabilities in the instruction-tuning process. We propose a novel hallucination attack against MLLMs that exploits attention sink behaviors to trigger hallucinated content with minimal image-text relevance, posing a significant threat to critical downstream applications. Distinguished from previous adversarial methods that rely on fixed patterns, our approach generates dynamic, effective, and highly transferable visual adversarial inputs, without sacrificing the quality of model responses. Comprehensive experiments on 6 prominent MLLMs demonstrate the efficacy of our attack in compromising black-box MLLMs even with extensive mitigating mechanisms, as well as the promising results against cutting-edge commercial APIs, such as GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5.

These approaches merge strong pre-trained vision models and large language models (LLMs). Since these components are trained separately, the learned representations need to be aligned with joint training on additional image-language pairs. This procedure is not perfect and can cause the model to hallucinate - provide answers that do not accurately reflect the image, even when the core LLM is highly factual and the vision backbone has sufficiently complete representations. In this work, we frame the hallucination problem as an alignment issue, tackle it with preference tuning. Specifically, we propose POVID to generate feedback data with AI models. We use ground-truth instructions as the preferred response and a two-stage approach to generate dispreferred data. First, we prompt GPT-4V to inject plausible hallucinations into the correct answer. Second, we distort the image to trigger the inherent hallucination behavior of the VLLM. This is an automated approach, which does not rely on human data generation or require a perfect expert, which makes it easily scalable. Finally, both of these generation strategies are integrated into an RLHF pipeline via Direct Preference Optimization.

POVID exclusively generates *dispreferred* feedback data using AI models, while treating ground-truth instructions as preferred responses.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**: POVID's key innovation lies in its two-stage, automated approach to generating dispreferred responses, eliminating the need for human labeling:\n        1.  **Hallucinating Textual Responses**: Utilizes GPT-4V to inject plausible hallucinations into the *correct* ground-truth answer. This is tailored for different tasks:\n            *   For image captioning, it introduces errors related to object co-occurrence, logical relationships between entities, and incorrect entity attributes.\n            *   For reasoning tasks (VQA), it modifies the reasoning process itself, introducing logical errors while attempting to keep changes subtle.\n        2.  **Mitigating Inherent Hallucination Patterns**: Introduces controlled diffusion noise into the input image during training. This noise disrupts the VLLM's visual comprehension, provoking its *inherent* hallucination patterns (e.g., prioritizing textual context or learned associations over visual cues). The responses generated under these noisy conditions are treated as dispreferred.\n    *   **Integration**: Both types of AI-generated dispreferences are integrated into a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) framework via a reformulated loss function (L_POVID), which balances preferred and dispreferred terms. The noise-triggered dispreferred responses are conditioned on prior tokens from the preferred response to control reliability.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**: The POVID framework for VLLM preference optimization.\n    *   **Data Generation Technique**: A scalable, automated, two-stage AI-generated dispreference data creation process, leveraging GPT-4V for textual hallucination injection and diffusion noise for triggering inherent VLLM hallucinations.\n    *   **Optimization Formulation**: A reformulated DPO loss (L_POVID) that effectively combines dispreferences from both textual manipulation and image distortion, specifically designed for VLLM modality alignment.\n    *   **Mechanism for Inherent Hallucination**: A method to provoke and correct inherent hallucination patterns in the target VLLM by introducing controlled noise to the input image during real-time training.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: The authors conducted experiments across a broad range of VLLM benchmarks to evaluate POVID's effectiveness in reducing hallucinations and improving overall performance.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   **Benchmarks**: SciQA-IMG, MMBench, MM-Vet, LLaVA-Bench, 100-CHAIRS, 100-CHAIRi, and POPEMMHal.\n        *   **Comparison**: POVID was compared against LLaVA-1.5 (baseline) and other preference learning approaches for VLLMs, including Vlfeedback, Human-Preference, and RLHF-V.\n        *   **Results**: POVID significantly outperformed prior approaches, achieving an average performance improvement of 12.4% across the evaluated benchmarks. The results demonstrate that POVID not only reduces hallucinations but also enhances overall VLLM performance and redirects the model's attention towards the image modality, leading to better alignment.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The approach relies on the quality and controllability of GPT-4V for generating plausible textual hallucinations and the effectiveness of diffusion noise in reliably triggering *inherent* VLLM hallucinations within a \"reasonable range\" where the image remains recognizable. The specific hyperparameters for noise steps (`k`) and loss coefficients (`α, β1, β2`) are crucial for performance.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: POVID is primarily applicable to VLLMs that require improved modality alignment and hallucination reduction, particularly in tasks like image captioning and visual question answering. Its automated nature makes it suitable for large-scale deployment.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: POVID significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in VLLM alignment and hallucination mitigation by introducing a novel, automated, and scalable preference tuning framework. It moves beyond costly human feedback and addresses the unique challenges of preference data generation for image-centric models.\n    *   **Potential Impact**: This work has the potential to enable the development of more reliable, factual, and trustworthy VLLMs, making them safer for deployment in critical applications. It opens new avenues for research into automated, AI-driven feedback generation for multimodal models and more sophisticated techniques for aligning disparate modalities.",

        "abstract": "Vision language models (VLMs) perceive the world through a combination of a visual encoder and a large language model (LLM). The visual encoder, pre-trained on large-scale vision-text datasets, provides zero-shot generalization to visual data, and the LLM endows its high reasoning ability to VLMs. It leads VLMs to achieve high performance on wide benchmarks without fine-tuning, exhibiting zero or few-shot capability. However, recent studies show that VLMs are vulnerable to hallucination. This undesirable behavior degrades reliability and credibility, thereby making users unable to fully trust the output from VLMs. To enhance trustworthiness and better tackle the hallucination of VLMs, we curate a new evaluation dataset, called the BEfore-AFter hallucination dataset (BEAF), and introduce new metrics: True Understanding (TU), IGnorance (IG), StuBbornness (SB), and InDecision (ID). Unlike prior works that focus only on constructing questions and answers, the key idea of our benchmark is to manipulate visual scene information by image editing models and to design the metrics based on scene changes. This allows us to clearly assess whether VLMs correctly understand a given scene by observing the ability to perceive changes. We also visualize image-wise object relationship by virtue of our two-axis view: vision and text. Upon evaluating VLMs with our dataset, we observed that our metrics reveal different aspects of VLM hallucination that have not been reported before.

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review, adhering to your specified structure and citation requirements:\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of \"BEAF: Observing BEfore-AFter Changes to Evaluate Hallucination in Vision-language Models\"\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** Vision-language models (VLMs) are highly susceptible to hallucination, where their generated outputs do not accurately reflect the factual content of input images \\cite{yebin2024txh}. This includes incorrectly asserting the presence of objects not depicted in the image.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** This hallucination significantly degrades the reliability and credibility of VLMs, hindering genuine communication and eroding user trust \\cite{yebin2024txh}. Addressing this is crucial for improving system trustworthiness, especially in sensitive applications. The challenge lies in developing a comprehensive assessment framework that can deeply explore the underlying causes of hallucination in multi-modal VLMs, which process both visual and textual information.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches:** Prior hallucination benchmarks, such as POPE \\cite{yebin2024txh}, CIEM \\cite{yebin2024txh}, and AMBER \\cite{yebin2024txh}, typically adopt a Visual Question Answering (VQA) style. They provide simple question-and-answer (QnA) evaluations, often using discriminative (yes/no, multi-choice) or generative (open-ended caption) question types.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:** These prior studies primarily focus on \"text-axis\" evaluation, manipulating only the textual aspects of questions and answers \\cite{yebin2024txh}. This approach is insufficient for a thorough analysis of hallucination in VLMs, which inherently handle both visual and text modalities. It makes it difficult to disentangle the true sources of hallucination, particularly when objects frequently co-occur, preventing a clear assessment of whether VLMs genuinely understand scene information or merely rely on learned associations \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper proposes the BEfore-AFter (BEAF) hallucination evaluation benchmark, which innovatively manipulates visual scene information in addition to augmenting textual questions \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n        *   **Vision-axis Manipulation:** The core idea involves manipulating visual scenes by selectively removing objects from original images. This is achieved through a three-stage pipeline: automatic object removal using mask extraction (SAM) and inpainting (LaMa), followed by a filtering stage, and finally, human-guided manipulation to refine images and eliminate artifacts \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n        *   **Change-aware Metrics:** New evaluation metrics are introduced to assess how VLM answers change in response to these visual manipulations.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:**\n        *   **Multi-modal Evaluation:** BEAF uniquely evaluates VLMs along both vision and text axes, providing a more granular and comprehensive analysis of hallucination compared to previous text-axis-only methods \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n        *   **Perception of Change:** The benchmark's key innovation is its ability to observe whether VLMs correctly perceive and adapt their answers to explicit visual scene changes (e.g., an object being removed), thereby assessing true understanding rather than mere memorization or statistical correlation \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n        *   **Novel Metrics:** The introduction of True Understanding (TU), IGnorance (IG), StuBbornness (SB), and InDecision (ID) provides specific, change-aware measures to characterize different facets of VLM hallucinatory behavior \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Benchmark & Dataset:** Introduction of the BEAF benchmark, which includes a dataset of 500 original and 1,727 meticulously manipulated images (derived from MS-COCO), paired with 26,118 image-question pairs, enabling evaluation across both vision and text axes \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n    *   **Novel Change-aware Metrics:** Development of four new metrics for detailed hallucination evaluation:\n        *   **True Understanding (TU):** Measures if a model correctly answers for a removed object both before (present) and after (absent) manipulation \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n        *   **IGnorance (IG):** Quantifies instances where models consistently provide incorrect answers regarding removed objects \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n        *   **StuBbornness (SB):** Identifies cases where models give the same answer despite a visual change that should alter the ground truth for removed objects \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n        *   **InDecision (ID):** Captures situations where answers change even when the target object remains unchanged or was never present in the image \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n    *   **Robust Image Manipulation Pipeline:** A three-stage pipeline for creating high-quality manipulated images, combining automatic object removal (using SAM for masks and LaMa for inpainting) with human filtering and refinement to ensure artifact-free results \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n    *   **Visualization of Object Relationships:** The framework facilitates visualizing the impact of relationships between objects within hallucinatory images based on the BEAF evaluation results \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** The paper evaluates various Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using the curated BEAF dataset and the newly proposed change-aware metrics \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results:**\n        *   Evaluation utilizes the novel metrics (TU, IG, SB, ID) alongside traditional metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n        *   **Key Findings:** The BEAF metrics reveal distinct aspects of VLM hallucination that were not previously reported or detectable by existing text-axis-only evaluation methods \\cite{yebin2024txh}. Notably, outcomes previously considered non-hallucinatory by prior benchmarks are shown to potentially be hallucinations when assessed with the BEAF framework \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n        *   The study also includes an analysis of the influence of individual objects within a scene and a discussion on open-generation answers and CLIPScore results \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** While not explicitly detailed as limitations in the provided text, the reliance on a meticulous human-guided manipulation stage for dataset creation implies that fully automated, high-fidelity object removal without any detectable artifacts remains a significant challenge \\cite{yebin2024txh}. The dataset's foundation on MS-COCO might also limit its generalizability to broader or more complex real-world visual scenarios.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The BEAF benchmark is specifically designed for a granular evaluation of hallucination in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by assessing their ability to perceive and respond to explicit visual scene changes \\cite{yebin2024txh}. It is particularly applicable to models that integrate both visual and textual inputs and aims to provide a deeper understanding of their multi-modal reasoning and perception capabilities.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** BEAF significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in VLM hallucination evaluation by introducing a multi-modal assessment framework that incorporates vision-axis manipulations, moving beyond the limitations of text-only evaluations \\cite{yebin2024txh}. This provides a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of VLM behavior, uncovering previously undetected forms of hallucination.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:**\n        *   **Improved VLM Development:** The benchmark and its novel metrics offer a more robust diagnostic tool for identifying and understanding VLM weaknesses, thereby guiding the development of more reliable, trustworthy, and factually grounded multi-modal models \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n        *   **Deeper Hallucination Analysis:** It enables researchers to more effectively disentangle the sources of hallucination by directly observing how models react to explicit visual changes, fostering targeted research into mitigation strategies \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n        *   **New Research Directions:** The ability to visualize object relationships and the granular evaluation metrics can inspire new research avenues into how VLMs process multi-modal information, how internal knowledge biases their responses, and how to build models with true visual understanding \\cite{yebin2024txh}.\n\n---",

        "abstract": "Despite their impressive capabilities, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are prone to hallucinations, i.e., the generated content that is nonsensical or unfaithful to input sources. Unlike in LLMs, hallucinations in MLLMs often stem from the sensitivity of text decoder to visual tokens, leading to a phenomenon akin to\"amnesia\"about visual information. To address this issue, we propose MemVR, a novel decoding paradigm inspired by common cognition: when the memory of an image seen the moment before is forgotten, people will look at it again for factual answers. Following this principle, we treat visual tokens as supplementary evidence, re-injecting them into the MLLM through Feed Forward Network (FFN) as\"key-value memory\"at the middle trigger layer. This\"look-twice\"mechanism occurs when the model exhibits high uncertainty during inference, effectively enhancing factual alignment. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that MemVR significantly mitigates hallucination across various MLLMs and excels in general benchmarks without incurring additional time overhead.

        "abstract": "Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on various visual-language understanding and generation tasks. However, MLLMs occasionally generate content inconsistent with the given images, which is known as \"hallucination\". Prior works primarily center on evaluating hallucination using standard, unperturbed benchmarks, which overlook the prevalent occurrence of perturbed inputs in real-world scenarios-such as image cropping or blurring-that are critical for a comprehensive assessment of MLLMs' hallucination. In this paper, to bridge this gap, we propose Hallu-PI, the first benchmark designed to evaluate Hallucination in MLLMs within Perturbed Inputs. Specifically, Hallu-PI consists of seven perturbed scenarios, containing 1,260 perturbed images from 11 object types. Each image is accompanied by detailed annotations, which include fine-grained hallucination types, such as existence, attribute, and relation. We equip these annotations with a rich set of questions, making Hallu-PI suitable for both discriminative and generative tasks. Extensive experiments on 12 mainstream MLLMs, such as GPT-4V and Gemini-Pro Vision, demonstrate that these models exhibit significant hallucinations on Hallu-PI, which is not observed in unperturbed scenarios. Furthermore, our research reveals a severe bias in MLLMs' ability to handle different types of hallucinations. We also design two baselines specifically for perturbed scenarios, namely Perturbed-Reminder and Perturbed-ICL. We hope that our study will bring researchers' attention to the limitations of MLLMs when dealing with perturbed inputs, and spur further investigations to address this issue.

Previous research has primarily focused on assessing the performance of LALMs across various tasks, yet overlooking their reliability, particularly concerning issues like object hallucination.

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review:\n\n### Technical Paper Analysis: Understanding Sounds, Missing the Questions: The Challenge of Object Hallucination in Large Audio-Language Models \\cite{kuan20249pm}\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific technical problem**: The paper addresses the issue of \"object hallucination\" in Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs), where models generate or affirm the presence of objects in audio that are not actually there.\n    *   **Why important and challenging**: LALMs integrate audio perception with Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle diverse audio-related tasks. While previous research has focused on task performance, the reliability of LALMs, particularly concerning hallucination, has been largely overlooked. Hallucination is a known problem in LLMs and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), but there was a lack of discussion and benchmarks for LALMs in the audio domain. This unreliability can lead to incorrect information and reduced trustworthiness in practical applications.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to existing approaches**: LALMs build upon traditional LLMs by adding audio perception capabilities. Existing LALM evaluation benchmarks like Dynamic-SUPERB \\cite{kuan20249pm} and AIR-Bench \\cite{kuan20249pm} primarily assess task performance.\n    *   **Limitations of previous solutions**: These benchmarks do not adequately evaluate the reliability of LALM-generated content, specifically object hallucination. While hallucination has been studied in LLMs and LVLMs (e.g., in image captioning), its prevalence and characteristics in LALMs within speech and audio domains were unexplored, and no specific benchmarks existed to measure it.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core technical method or algorithm**: The paper introduces novel methods to assess object hallucination in LALMs through two main task types:\n        *   **Discriminative Tasks**: Formulated as binary classification (Yes/No) to determine the presence of a specific object's sound. Questions are generated using positive (ground truth) and negative samples (Random, Popular, and Adversarial sampling strategies for non-existent objects). Performance is measured by accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and \"Yes\" answer ratio.\n        *   **Generative Tasks**: Involves audio captioning (e.g., \"Describe the audio\") and noisy Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Nouns are extracted from generated captions using NLP tools (SpaCy \\cite{kuan20249pm}) and compared against ground truth labels to identify hallucinated objects.\n    *   **What makes this approach novel or different**: This is the first work to systematically explore and quantify object hallucination in LALMs. It introduces specific evaluation methodologies and metrics tailored for this problem in the audio domain, including novel negative sampling strategies for discriminative questions and the ECHO (Evaluation of Caption Hallucination in audiO) and Cover metrics for generative tasks. It also explores prompt engineering as a mitigation strategy.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel algorithms, methods, or techniques**:\n        *   Introduction of discriminative and generative evaluation tasks specifically designed to measure object hallucination in LALMs.\n        *   Development of three negative sampling strategies (Random, Popular, Adversarial) for constructing discriminative questions.\n        *   Proposal of ECHO (instance-level ECHO_I and sentence-level ECHO_S) and Cover metrics for quantifying hallucination and coverage in generative audio captioning.\n        *   Investigation into prompt engineering techniques to improve LALM performance on discriminative tasks.\n    *   **Theoretical insights or analysis**: The paper reveals a critical discrepancy: LALMs perform well on audio captioning (generative tasks) but struggle significantly with discriminative questions, indicating a weakness in understanding the *nature* of discriminative queries rather than a fundamental inability to process audio content.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments conducted**:\n        *   Evaluated five publicly available LALMs: Qwen-Audio \\cite{kuan20249pm}, Qwen-Audio-Chat \\cite{kuan20249pm}, LTU-AS-7B \\cite{kuan20249pm}, SALMONN-7B \\cite{kuan20249pm}, and SALMONN-13B \\cite{kuan20249pm}.\n        *   Compared LALMs against a \"Specialized\" cascade pipeline (Whisper-based audio captioning \\cite{kuan20249pm} + ChatGPT \\cite{kuan20249pm} or LLaMA-7b-chat \\cite{kuan20249pm}).\n        *   Used AudioCaps \\cite{kuan20249pm} for audio captioning and CHIME-6 \\cite{kuan20249pm} for noisy ASR.\n        *   Tested five different prompts for both task types and explored greedy vs. sample decoding strategies.\n        *   Investigated eight different prefix prompts for prompt engineering on discriminative tasks.\n    *   **Key performance metrics and comparison results**:\n        *   **Discriminative Tasks**: LALMs exhibited significantly lower recall than precision, indicating a strong tendency to give affirmative answers (hallucinate). F1 scores decreased with more challenging negative sampling strategies (Adversarial < Popular < Random). LALMs were highly sensitive to prompt design. The \"Specialized\" cascade pipeline significantly outperformed all LALMs in F1 scores, highlighting a substantial gap.\n        *   **Generative Tasks**: LALMs' performance on ECHO and Cover metrics was comparable to specialized Whisper-based caption models, demonstrating their capability in understanding audio information and similar levels of object hallucination in captioning. Greedy decoding generally reduced hallucination in generative tasks.\n        *   **Prompt Engineering**: Specific prefix prompts, particularly those emphasizing careful consideration of the question (e.g., P3, P4, P6, P8), led to significant F1 score improvements for some LALMs (e.g., SALMONN models, Qwen-Audio-Chat-7B), but not universally (e.g., LTU-AS-7B showed degradation).\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical limitations or assumptions**: The study primarily focuses on object hallucination and suggests that LALMs' struggle lies in comprehending discriminative queries rather than processing audio content itself. The effectiveness of prompt engineering was model-dependent.\n    *   **Scope of applicability**: The proposed evaluation methods and insights are directly applicable to assessing and improving the reliability of LALMs in audio captioning and related audio understanding tasks.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **How does this advance the technical state-of-the-art**: This work is the first to systematically identify and quantify object hallucination in LALMs, filling a critical gap in LALM reliability research. It introduces novel and comprehensive evaluation methodologies (discriminative/generative tasks, ECHO/Cover metrics) that can serve as benchmarks for future LALM development. It highlights a crucial weakness in current LALMs regarding their understanding of discriminative queries, even when their audio comprehension is strong.\n    *   **Potential impact on future research**: The findings will guide future LALM research towards developing more robust models that are less prone to hallucination, particularly by focusing on improving query understanding mechanisms. It encourages the development of LALMs that can precisely discriminate information from audio, rather than just generating descriptive captions. The proposed evaluation framework provides a valuable tool for assessing the reliability of new LALM architectures.",

This leads to:\n        *   High computational costs due to running large models in the verification loop.\n        *   Potential pitfalls like reward hacking and model collapse, stemming from the inherent biases and limitations of MLLMs acting as their own evaluators.\n        *   Resource inefficiency, as many samples are generated but only a small subset is used.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Previous self-improvement methods for MLLMs (e.g., RLAIF-V \\cite{deng202405j}, M3ID \\cite{deng202405j}, POVID \\cite{deng202405j}, STIC \\cite{deng202405j}) typically involve sampling responses and then using another MLLM as a reward model or verifier to create preference learning pairs.

It extends the idea of external verifiers (like CLIP-DPO \\cite{deng202405j}) to handle long captions.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The framework comprises three main stages:\n        1.  **Controllable Dataset Generation**: The seed MLLM generates both positive and negative response candidates for a given image and instruction. Negative samples are generated by introducing a \"hallucination ratio\" (`hratio`) during the decoding process. This `hratio` blends token distributions from a conditional path (with image) and an unconditional path (without image), allowing precise control over the level of hallucination injected \\cite{deng202405j}.\n        2.  **Lightweight Preference Data Inversion**: A lightweight, contrastive language-image encoder (specifically, a CLIP model) is used to evaluate the quality of the generated positive and negative captions. It computes average sentence-level CLIP scores for each caption. If the initially designated \"positive\" caption scores lower than the \"negative\" caption, their labels are automatically swapped to ensure accurate preference learning \\cite{deng202405j}.\n        3.  **Preference Learning Finetuning**: The refined preference pairs are then used to finetune the seed MLLM using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) \\cite{deng202405j}, a simpler and more stable alternative to RLHF/RLAIF.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**: The key innovation is the \"judge-free\" nature of the verification process. Instead of relying on another MLLM, the framework uses a predefined, controllable mechanism for negative sample generation combined with a lightweight, objective verifier (CLIP-score) for data quality control and label inversion.

The method achieved \"superior precision and recall with significantly lower computational demands\" compared to conventional techniques \\cite{deng202405j}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: While not explicitly detailed in the provided text, the \"lightweight\" nature of the verifier (CLIP model) implies a reliance on its inherent capabilities for semantic similarity. The effectiveness of the `hratio` for controlled hallucination generation is also a key assumption. The paper focuses on improving MLLM reliability and robustness, particularly concerning hallucination.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The method is primarily applicable to MLLMs for self-improvement tasks, particularly those involving caption generation and hallucination control. It offers a general framework for generating and filtering preference data efficiently.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: This work advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing an efficient and scalable pathway for MLLM self-improvement that bypasses the computational and reliability issues of MLLM-as-judge approaches \\cite{deng202405j}. It demonstrates that high-quality preference data can be generated and verified without relying on expensive and potentially biased large models.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: The judge-free framework could inspire future research into more resource-efficient and robust self-improvement mechanisms for large models, reducing the barriers to entry for training and finetuning. It opens avenues for exploring alternative lightweight verifiers and more sophisticated controllable data generation strategies, ultimately leading to more reliable and trustworthy MLLMs \\cite{deng202405j}.",

Previous efforts have primarily focused on investigating object hallucinations, which can be easily alleviated by introducing object detectors. However, these efforts neglect hallucinations in inter-object relationships, which is essential for visual comprehension. In this work, we introduce R-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating Vision Relationship Hallucination. R-Bench features image-level questions that focus on the existence of relationships and instance-level questions that assess local visual comprehension. We identify three types of relationship co-occurrences that lead to hallucinations: relationship-relationship, subject-relationship, and relationship-object. The visual instruction tuning dataset's long-tail distribution significantly impacts LVLMs' understanding of visual relationships. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that current LVLMs tend to disregard visual content and overly rely on the common sense knowledge of Large Language Models.

        "title": "THRONE: An Object-Based Hallucination Benchmark for the Free-Form Generations of Large Vision-Language Models",
        "abstract": "Mitigating hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) remains an open problem. Recent benchmarks do not address hallucinations in open-ended free-form responses, which we term “Type I hallucinations”. Instead, they focus on hallucinations responding to very specific question formats-typically a multiple-choice response regarding a particular object or attribute-which we term “Type II hallucinations”. Additionally, such benchmarks often require external API calls to models which are subject to change. In practice, we observe that a reduction in Type II hallucinations does not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations but rather that the two forms of halluci-nations are often anti-correlated. To address this, we propose THRONE, a novel object-based automatic framework for quantitatively evaluating Type I hallucinations in LVLM free-form outputs. We use public language models (LMs) to identify hallucinations in LVLM responses and compute informative metrics. By evaluating a large selection of recent LVLMs using public datasets, we show that an improvement in existing metrics do not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations, and that established benchmarks for measuring Type I hallucinations are incomplete. Finally, we provide a simple and effective data augmentation method to reduce Type I and Type II hallucinations as a strong baseline.",

        "abstract": "Despite the rapid progress and outstanding performance of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in recent years, LVLMs have been plagued by the issue of hallucination, i.e., LVLMs tend to generate responses that are inconsistent with the corresponding visual inputs. To evaluate the degree of hallucination in LVLMs, previous works have proposed a series of benchmarks featuring different types of tasks and evaluation metrics. However, we find that the quality of the existing hallucination benchmarks varies, with some suffering from problems, e.g., inconsistent evaluation results under repeated tests, and misalignment with human evaluation. To this end, we propose a Hallucination benchmark Quality Measurement framework (HQM), which leverages various indicators to assess the reliability and validity of existing hallucination benchmarks separately. Specifically, for reliability we explore test-retest reliability and parallel-forms reliability, while for validity we examine criterion validity and coverage of hallucination types. Furthermore, based on the results of our quality measurement, we construct a High-Quality Hallucination Benchmark (HQH) for LVLMs, which demonstrates superior reliability and validity under our HQM framework. We conduct an extensive evaluation of over 10 representative LVLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro, to provide an in-depth analysis of the hallucination issues in existing models.

        "abstract": "Following the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), expanding their boundaries to new modalities represents a significant paradigm shift in multimodal understanding. Human perception is inherently multimodal, relying not only on text but also on auditory and visual cues for a complete understanding of the world. In recognition of this fact, audio-visual LLMs have recently emerged. Despite promising developments, the lack of dedicated benchmarks poses challenges for understanding and evaluating models. In this work, we show that audio-visual LLMs struggle to discern subtle relationships between audio and visual signals, leading to hallucinations and highlighting the need for reliable benchmarks. To address this, we introduce AVHBench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the perception and comprehension capabilities of audio-visual LLMs. Our benchmark includes tests for assessing hallucinations, as well as the cross-modal matching and reasoning abilities of these models. Our results reveal that most existing audio-visual LLMs struggle with hallucinations caused by cross-interactions between modalities, due to their limited capacity to perceive complex multimodal signals and their relationships.

This includes perceiving imaginary sounds from visual cues (video-driven audio hallucination) or fake visual events from audio cues (audio-driven video hallucination).\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: Human perception is inherently multimodal, making robust AV-LLMs crucial for comprehensive scene understanding. However, the inherent heterogeneity and varying information content across modalities make joint processing challenging. A significant gap exists in dedicated benchmarks to systematically evaluate these cross-modal hallucinations, hindering the development of reliable and robust AV-LLMs \\cite{sungbin2024r2g}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Previous hallucination benchmarks for Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) primarily focus on single modalities, such as visual LLMs (e.g., POPE, CIEM, NOPE for image-based object presence/absence; AMBER, GAVIE for generative captions) or audio-only models \\cite{sungbin2024r2g}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: These existing benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating *cross-modal driven hallucinations* because they assess within a single modality. They fail to capture the complex interactions and potential misinterpretations that arise when AV-LLMs process simultaneous audio-visual inputs and their intricate relationships \\cite{sungbin2024r2g}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper introduces **AVHBench**, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate cross-modal hallucinations in audio-visual LLMs \\cite{sungbin2024r2g}. It comprises four distinct tasks:\n        *   **Judgment Tasks (Yes/No QnA)**:\n            *   **Audio-driven Video Hallucination**: Assesses if an audio signal causes the model to hallucinate a visible object/event.\n            *   **Video-driven Audio Hallucination**: Evaluates if a visual signal causes the model to hallucinate an audible sound.\n            *   **Audio-visual Matching**: Determines the model's ability to recognize correspondence between audio and visual contexts.\n        *   **Description Task**:\n            *   **Audio-visual Captioning**: Prompts the model to generate a caption describing both visual and auditory signals, assessing for hallucinated descriptions.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   **Cross-modal Focus**: AVHBench uniquely targets hallucinations arising from the *interaction* between audio and visual modalities, a critical aspect for true multimodal understanding \\cite{sungbin2024r2g}.\n        *   **Semi-automatic Annotation Pipeline**: A novel two-stage pipeline minimizes human labor while ensuring high-quality annotations:\n            1.  **Disentangling Audio-visual Information**: Leverages existing dataset captions (VALOR, AudioCaps), visual tags from RAM++, and ChatGPT (GPT4) with few-shot examples to categorize fine-grained audio-visual cues (e.g., in-view sound source, out-of-view silent object).\n            2.  **QnA Generation**: Employs a rule-based algorithm and ChatGPT to generate QnA pairs and captions for the four tasks, followed by human verification.\n        *   **Synthetic Videos**: Creation of challenging synthetic videos by swapping audio from different sources to introduce natural mismatches, specifically designed to test cross-modal discernment \\cite{sungbin2024r2g}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Benchmark**: Introduction of **AVHBench**, the first benchmark specifically designed to assess cross-modal hallucinations in audio-visual LLMs \\cite{sungbin2024r2g}.\n    *   **Efficient Data Generation**: Development of a semi-automatic annotation pipeline that significantly reduces manual labeling costs while ensuring high-quality, fine-grained audio-visual annotations.\n    *   **Comprehensive Analysis**: Provides a systematic framework and dataset (5,302 QnA pairs, 1,106 captions across 2,136 videos) for analyzing the presence and causes of cross-modal hallucinations in AV-LLMs.\n    *   **Insights for Robustness**: Demonstrates that simple training methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning with enhanced feature alignment, can improve AV-LLM robustness against cross-modal hallucinations \\cite{sungbin2024r2g}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: The paper evaluates six recent audio-visual LLMs on the proposed AVHBench dataset \\cite{sungbin2024r2g}. It also conducts ablation studies using a simple training method (LoRA fine-tuning) with an annotation-enriched training dataset generated by their pipeline.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**: Performance is assessed based on accuracy for the judgment tasks (Yes/No QnA) and the ability to generate accurate, non-hallucinated captions for the description task.\n    *   **Comparison Results**:\n        *   Current audio-visual LLMs are generally prone to both audio-driven and video-driven hallucinations \\cite{sungbin2024r2g}.\n        *   These models tend to perform better with unimodal signals or even text-only inputs, indicating a limited capacity to handle complex multimodal signals and their relationships.\n        *   LoRA fine-tuning, combined with enhanced feature alignment, significantly improves the performance and robustness of AV-LLMs against cross-modal hallucinations \\cite{sungbin2024r2g}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**: The pipeline's reliance on existing datasets and large language models (ChatGPT/GPT4) for initial disentanglement and QnA generation implies potential dependencies on their inherent biases or limitations. The \"simple training method\" for improvement suggests an initial exploration rather than a complete solution to all forms of hallucination \\cite{sungbin2024r2g}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: AVHBench is specifically tailored to cross-modal hallucinations in *audio-visual* LLMs. While insights on multimodal signal handling may generalize, the benchmark's direct applicability is within this specific modality combination.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: AVHBench fills a critical gap by providing the first dedicated benchmark for evaluating cross-modal driven hallucinations in audio-visual LLMs, moving beyond single-modality assessments \\cite{sungbin2024r2g}.

        "abstract": "Contrastive decoding strategies are widely used to mitigate object hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By reducing over-reliance on language priors, these strategies ensure that generated content remains closely grounded in visual inputs, producing contextually accurate outputs. Since contrastive decoding requires no additional training or external tools, it offers both computational efficiency and versatility, making it highly attractive. However, these methods present two main limitations: (1) bluntly suppressing language priors can compromise coherence and accuracy of generated content, and (2) processing contrastive inputs adds computational load, significantly slowing inference speed. To address these challenges, we propose Visual Amplification Fusion (VAF), a plug-and-play technique that enhances attention to visual signals within the model’s middle layers, where modality fusion predominantly occurs. This approach enables more effective capture of visual features, reducing the model’s bias toward language modality. Experimental results demonstrate that VAF significantly reduces hallucinations across various MLLMs without affecting inference speed, while maintaining coherence and accuracy in generated outputs.

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **1. Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently suffer from \"object hallucination,\" where generated textual descriptions do not accurately reflect objects present in the visual input \\cite{yin2025s2b}. This stems from an over-reliance on unimodal (especially language) priors during inference.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: Object hallucination poses significant risks in high-precision applications like medical diagnosis and autonomous driving. Existing mitigation strategies, particularly contrastive decoding, introduce their own challenges: they can compromise the coherence and accuracy of generated content and significantly increase inference time due to the need for processing additional contrastive inputs \\cite{yin2025s2b}.\n\n*   **2. Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: The paper positions itself against existing Contrastive Decoding strategies (e.g., Visual Contrastive Decoding - VCD, Instruction Contrastive Decoding - ICD) which aim to reduce hallucination by contrasting output distributions from original and perturbed inputs \\cite{yin2025s2b}. These methods are attractive due to being training-free and versatile.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: While effective in reducing reliance on language priors, contrastive decoding methods have two main drawbacks:\n        1.  They can degrade the quality, coherence, and accuracy of generated content, especially in complex tasks requiring nuanced natural language generation (e.g., a 19% decrease on NoCaps and 5% on ScienceQA for VCD) \\cite{yin2025s2b}.\n        2.  They considerably increase inference time (nearly doubling it for VCD) because they require separate processing of original and contrastive inputs \\cite{yin2025s2b}.\n\n*   **3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes Visual Amplification Fusion (VAF), a plug-and-play technique designed to mitigate object hallucinations \\cite{yin2025s2b}.

Saliency analysis was performed to understand visual information flow and attention distribution across modalities \\cite{yin2025s2b}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   **Hallucination Mitigation**: VAF \\cite{yin2025s2b} demonstrated notable performance gains, with approximately 3% improvement on the POPE benchmark and 7% on MME.\n        *   **Content Coherence and Accuracy**: While VCD caused a significant decrease (e.g., ~19% on NoCaps and 5% on ScienceQA), VAF \\cite{yin2025s2b} maintained content quality without negative impacts.\n        *   **Inference Speed**: VCD reduced inference speed by 50% (nearly doubling inference time), whereas VAF \\cite{yin2025s2b} had virtually no effect on inference speed.\n\n*   **6.

Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: ClearSight, with its VAF method, significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing a training-free, plug-and-play solution that effectively mitigates object hallucination in MLLMs without compromising content quality or inference speed \\cite{yin2025s2b}.

        "abstract": "Object hallucination has been an Achilles' heel which hinders the broader applications of large vision-language models (LVLMs). Object hallucination refers to the phenomenon that the LVLMs claim non-existent objects in the image. To mitigate the object hallucinations, instruction tuning and external model-based detection methods have been proposed, which either require large-scare computational resources or depend on the detection result of external models. However, there remains an under-explored field to utilize the LVLM itself to alleviate object hallucinations. In this work, we adopt the intuition that the LVLM tends to respond logically consistently for existent objects but inconsistently for hallucinated objects. Therefore, we propose a Logical Closed Loop-based framework for Object Hallucination Detection and Mitigation, namely LogicCheckGPT. In specific, we devise logical consistency probing to raise questions with logical correlations, inquiring about attributes from objects and vice versa. Whether their responses can form a logical closed loop serves as an indicator of object hallucination. As a plug-and-play method, it can be seamlessly applied to all existing LVLMs. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three benchmarks across four LVLMs have demonstrated significant improvements brought by our method, indicating its effectiveness and generality.",

The paper also distinguishes itself from consistency-checking methods in Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g., SelfCheckGPT), which typically assess consistency among responses to the *same* question \\cite{wu2024h81}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Instruction tuning demands substantial computational resources and high-quality data.

It operates on the principle that LVLMs exhibit logical consistency when discussing existent objects but inconsistency for hallucinated ones. The framework comprises five steps:\n        1.  **Object Extraction**: An auxiliary LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5) extracts candidate objects from the LVLM's initial image description \\cite{wu2024h81}.\n        2.  **Object-to-Attribute Inquiring**: The LVLM is prompted to provide detailed attributes for each extracted object \\cite{wu2024h81}.\n        3.  **Attribute-to-Object Inquiring**: An LLM first extracts specific attributes from the descriptions, then formulates follow-up questions (e.g., \"Could you tell me all the objects that {attribute} in the image?\") to query which objects possess these attributes \\cite{wu2024h81}.\n        4.  **Logical Closed Loop Checking**: An LLM verifies if the object identified in the attribute-to-object response is consistent with the original examinee object, thus forming a \"logical closed loop\" \\cite{wu2024h81}.\n        5.  **Hallucination Detection and Mitigation**: A \"logical closed loop rate\" is calculated for each object. Objects with a rate below a predefined threshold are flagged as hallucinated, and the LVLM's original response is then rectified by removing content related to these objects \\cite{wu2024h81}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**: `LogicCheckGPT` is novel as it is the first to employ the \"logical closed loop\" concept for object hallucination alleviation in LVLMs \\cite{wu2024h81}. It is a training-free, plug-and-play method that relies solely on language interactions, avoiding the need for external models or internal parameter access, thereby leveraging the LVLM's inherent capabilities \\cite{wu2024h81}. The specific prompt design for attribute-to-object inquiring (asking for \"all objects\") is also a key innovation to ensure comprehensive coverage \\cite{wu2024h81}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**: Introduction of the \"logical closed loop\" as a novel metric and probing mechanism for object hallucination in LVLMs \\cite{wu2024h81}. Development of the `LogicCheckGPT` framework, which systematically uses a sequence of logically correlated questions to assess and correct LVLM outputs \\cite{wu2024h81}.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: A plug-and-play, training-free framework that seamlessly integrates with existing LVLMs, requiring no architectural modifications or retraining \\cite{wu2024h81}. The strategic use of an auxiliary LLM for sub-tasks like object and attribute extraction, and logical checking, enhances flexibility and robustness \\cite{wu2024h81}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: The core insight that the logical consistency of an LVLM's responses to related inquiries can serve as a reliable indicator of object hallucination \\cite{wu2024h81}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Comprehensive experiments were performed across three benchmarks, including the POPE dataset (with random, popular, and adversarial settings), and evaluated on four advanced LVLMs \\cite{wu2024h81}. GPT-4v assisted evaluation was also utilized \\cite{wu2024h81}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**: `LogicCheckGPT` demonstrated significant improvements in mitigating object hallucinations.

The effectiveness of hallucination detection relies on a properly tuned \"hallucination threshold\" (λ) \\cite{wu2024h81}. The approach assumes that LVLMs will exhibit differential logical consistency, which might not hold universally for all types of hallucinations or models \\cite{wu2024h81}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: `LogicCheckGPT` is designed as a plug-and-play solution, making it broadly applicable to any existing LVLM that can engage in language-based question-answering, without requiring model-specific training or internal access \\cite{wu2024h81}. Its primary focus is on detecting and mitigating object hallucinations in multimodal contexts \\cite{wu2024h81}.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: `LogicCheckGPT` significantly advances the state-of-the-art by providing a novel, training-free, and interpretable method for object hallucination mitigation that leverages the intrinsic reasoning capabilities of LVLMs themselves \\cite{wu2024h81}.

        "abstract": "Though advanced in understanding visual information with human languages, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) still suffer from multimodal hallucinations. A natural concern is that during multimodal interaction, the generated hallucinations could influence the LVLMs' subsequent generation. Thus, we raise a question: When presented with a query relevant to the previously generated hallucination, will LVLMs be misled and respond incorrectly, even though the ground visual information exists? To answer this, we propose a framework called MMHalSnowball to evaluate LVLMs' behaviors when encountering generated hallucinations, where LVLMs are required to answer specific visual questions within a curated hallucinatory conversation. Crucially, our experiment shows that the performance of open-source LVLMs drops by at least $31\\%$, indicating that LVLMs are prone to accept the generated hallucinations and make false claims that they would not have supported without distractions. We term this phenomenon Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing. To mitigate this, we further propose a training-free method called Residual Visual Decoding, where we revise the output distribution of LVLMs with the one derived from the residual visual input, providing models with direct access to the visual information.

        "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a central focus in both industry and academia, but often suffer from biases introduced by visual and language priors, which can lead to multimodal hallucination. These biases arise from the visual encoder and the Large Language Model (LLM) backbone, affecting the attention mechanism responsible for aligning multimodal inputs. Existing decoding-based mitigation methods focus on statistical correlations and overlook the causal relationships between attention mechanisms and model output, limiting their effectiveness in addressing these biases. To tackle this issue, we propose a causal inference framework termed CausalMM that applies structural causal modeling to MLLMs, treating modality priors as a confounder between attention mechanisms and output. Specifically, by employing backdoor adjustment and counterfactual reasoning at both the visual and language attention levels, our method mitigates the negative effects of modality priors and enhances the alignment of MLLM's inputs and outputs, with a maximum score improvement of 65.3% on 6 VLind-Bench indicators and 164 points on MME Benchmark compared to conventional methods. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach while being a plug-and-play solution. Our code is available at: https://github.com/The-Martyr/CausalMM",

These priors negatively impact output quality via the attention mechanism.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** Hallucinations degrade MLLM performance and reliability. Existing decoding-based mitigation methods are limited because they focus on statistical correlations and predetermined conclusions, overlooking the crucial causal relationships between attention mechanisms, modality priors, and model output. This prevents them from fully addressing the underlying biases.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** The work builds upon advancements in MLLMs and existing training-free hallucination mitigation techniques like Visual Contrastive Decoding (VCD) \\cite{leng2024vcd} and OPERA \\cite{huang2024opera}. It also draws from the field of causal inference applied to LLMs and vision systems.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n        *   Current decoding strategies (e.g., VCD) primarily rely on statistical correlations and posterior analysis, failing to systematically study the *causal* relationship between visual attention, language attention, modality priors, and model output.\n        *   This statistical focus limits the model's ability to comprehend underlying dependencies, exacerbating bias and leading to hallucinations.\n        *   Previous causal inference applications in LLMs/vision have not specifically focused on balancing visual and language priors to mitigate hallucinations.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper proposes a causal inference framework called **CAUSAL MM** that applies structural causal modeling (SCM) to MLLMs.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:**\n        *   It treats modality priors (visual and language) as confounding factors in the causal path between attention mechanisms and model output.\n        *   Employs **back-door adjustment** and **counterfactual reasoning** at both the visual and language attention levels.\n        *   This allows for deciphering the causal impact of effective attention on MLLM output by isolating the effects of modality priors.\n        *   Introduces specific counterfactual attention states (Random, Uniform, Reversed, Shuffled) to simulate attention failure and measure causal effects.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods:**\n        *   Construction of a flexible **structural causal framework (CAUSAL MM)** for MLLMs to explicitly model and address visual and language priors.\n        *   Application of **counterfactual reasoning** at both visual encoder attention and LLM backbone attention levels to ensure model output is more aligned with multimodal inputs.\n        *   Formalization of causal effect measurement using **back-door adjustment** to account for confounding factors (image, tokens, visual/language priors).\n        *   Definition of various **counterfactual attention states** (Random, Uniform, Reversed, Shuffled) for intervention.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations:** The framework is designed as a **plug-and-play solution**, allowing integration with any MLLM and other training-free methods without modifying model weights.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** Comprehensive experiments were performed on various benchmarks to evaluate hallucination mitigation and modality prior balancing. Ablation studies were also conducted on different counterfactual attention categories and intervention layers.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results:**\n        *   **VLind-Bench:** Designed to measure language priors. CAUSAL MM achieved a maximum score improvement of **65.3%** on 6 VLind-Bench indicators. For LLaVA-1.5, it significantly improved performance in the multimodal collaborative setting, indicating balanced priors. For Qwen2-VL, it improved visual priors, leading to optimal performance in language and multimodal settings.\n        *   **MME Benchmark:** Assesses perception and cognition. CAUSAL MM showed an improvement of **164 points**.\n        *   **POPE (Polling-based Object Probing Evaluation):** Evaluates object-level hallucination (accuracy, precision, recall, F1). CAUSAL MM achieved an average improvement of **5.37%** across three POPE benchmarks.\n        *   **Baselines:** Compared against LLaVa-1.5 and Qwen2-VL (MLLMs), and VCD and OPERA (hallucination mitigation methods). CAUSAL MM consistently outperformed these baselines.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The paper assumes that modality priors act as confounders and that their effects can be isolated and mitigated through causal interventions on attention mechanisms. The effectiveness relies on the chosen counterfactual attention states and the back-door adjustment principle.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The CAUSAL MM framework is a **plug-and-play, training-free solution** applicable to any MLLM, making it broadly usable for enhancing existing models.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** This work significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by introducing a principled **causal inference framework** for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs, moving beyond purely statistical approaches. It provides a deeper understanding of how modality priors causally influence MLLM outputs via attention.\n    *   **Potential Impact:** CAUSAL MM offers a robust and effective method to improve the fidelity and reliability of MLLMs by directly addressing the root cause of modality prior-induced hallucinations. Its plug-and-play nature makes it highly practical for immediate application. It could inspire further research into causal mechanisms within complex AI models and lead to more trustworthy multimodal AI systems.",

        "abstract": "Despite the recent breakthroughs achieved by Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) in understanding and responding to complex visual-textual contexts, their inherent hallucination tendencies limit their practical application in real-world scenarios that demand high levels of precision. Existing methods typically either fine-tune the LVLMs using additional data, which incurs extra costs in manual annotation and computational resources or perform comparisons at the decoding stage, which may eliminate useful language priors for reasoning while introducing inference time overhead. Therefore, we propose ICT, a lightweight, training-free method that calculates an intervention direction to shift the model’s focus towards different levels of visual information, enhancing its attention to high-level and fine-grained visual details. During the forward pass stage, the intervention is applied to the attention heads that encode the overall image information and the fine-grained object details, effectively mitigating the phenomenon of overly language priors, and thereby alleviating hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ICT achieves strong performance with a small amount of data and generalizes well across different datasets and models.

The problem is challenging due to:\n        *   **Overly Strong Language Priors**: Powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) within LVLMs often dominate weaker visual encoders, leading to an excessive reliance on language cues over visual input \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n        *   **Lack of Fine-Grained Visual Semantics**: Current visual decoders struggle to capture detailed visual features, resulting in errors regarding object attributes like color and quantity \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches**: Previous efforts to mitigate hallucinations generally fall into three categories:\n        *   **Fine-tuning with additional data**: Involves introducing high-quality annotated data to align model behavior with human interpretations \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n            *   *Limitations*: Requires costly manual annotation, substantial computational resources for model parameter updates, and limits scalability \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n        *   **Perceptual enhancement**: Incorporates auxiliary information (e.g., depth maps, segmentation maps) to assist visual encoders \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n            *   *Limitations*: Often requires manual selection of auxiliary features, limiting generalizability across tasks \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n        *   **Contrastive decoding (CD)**: Induces hallucinations (e.g., via blurring) and penalizes associated tokens during the decoding stage to mitigate language priors \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n            *   *Limitations*: Indiscriminately eliminates *all* language priors, including potentially beneficial ones, which can inadvertently lead to new hallucinations \\cite{chen2024j0g}. Also introduces inference time overhead \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n    *   **Positioning of this Work**: `\\cite{chen2024j0g}` proposes ICT, a novel, lightweight, training-free, and plug-and-play method that operates during the *forward pass*, unlike contrastive decoding methods. It enhances the model's focus on visual details without eliminating useful language priors and introduces no additional inference latency. It specifically targets the \"severely underexploited\" activation space during inference \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method (ICT)**: Image-Object Cross-Level Trusted Intervention \\cite{chen2024j0g} is a training-free, plug-and-play method that calculates an \"intervention direction\" to shift the model's focus towards different levels of visual information during the forward pass.\n    *   **Mechanism**: `\\cite{chen2024j0g}` identifies activation value deviations in attention heads that can shift the model from \"untrustworthy\" to \"trustworthy\" responses. It then applies targeted interventions to these heads.\n    *   **Two Levels of Intervention**:\n        *   **Image-Level Intervention**: Aims to enhance the model's focus on overall visual information to reduce over-reliance on language priors. It constructs trusted (original image) and untrusted (globally blurred image) data pairs, calculates an activation shift vector based on their differences, and trains binary classifiers (SVMs) for each attention head to identify those encoding overall image information. The shift is then applied to these selected heads \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n        *   **Object-Level Intervention**: Focuses on increasing attention to fine-grained object details to mitigate hallucinations caused by the omission of critical objects. It uses Grounding DINO to identify object regions, creates trusted (original image) and untrusted (locally blurred object region) data pairs, calculates an object-level activation shift vector, and trains binary classifiers to identify heads distinguishing these object-focused pairs. The shift is applied to these selected heads \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n    *   **Unified Approach**: Both Image-Level and Object-Level interventions are integrated by summing their respective shifts on selected attention heads, providing a balanced attention mechanism \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   **Forward Pass Intervention**: Operates during the forward pass, making it orthogonal and complementary to existing decoding strategies and introducing no additional latency \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n        *   **Targeted Head-Level Intervention**: Identifies and intervenes on specific attention heads responsible for encoding different levels of visual information (overall image vs. fine-grained objects) using binary classifiers \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n        *   **Preservation of Language Priors**: Enhances visual focus without indiscriminately eliminating beneficial language priors, a key limitation of contrastive decoding \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n        *   **Training-Free**: Does not require additional training or fine-tuning of the LVLM parameters \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   Proposes ICT \\cite{chen2024j0g}, a novel, training-free, plug-and-play method that effectively reduces hallucinations in LVLMs by enhancing focus on both overall visual information and fine-grained object details during the forward pass.\n    *   Introduces an intervention mechanism that operates during the forward pass, offering an alternative to decoding-stage methods and avoiding additional inference latency \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n    *   Develops a method to identify and target specific attention heads responsible for encoding different levels of visual information using binary classifiers and activation shift vectors derived from trusted/untrusted data pairs \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n    *   Demonstrates a balanced attention mechanism that mitigates excessive reliance on language priors while preserving useful ones \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Models Evaluated**: LLaVA-v1.5 \\cite{chen2024j0g} and Qwen-VL \\cite{chen2024j0g} were used as baseline LVLMs.\n    *   **Datasets**:\n        *   **POPE \\cite{chen2024j0g} (Polling-based Object Probing Evaluation)**: Used to assess object-level hallucinations with Yes/No questions.

        "abstract": "Recently, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in multi-modal context comprehension. However, they still suffer from hallucination problems referring to generating inconsistent outputs with the image content. To mitigate hallucinations, previous studies mainly focus on retraining LVLMs with custom datasets. Although effective, they inherently come with additional computational costs. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework, \\textbf{MVP}, that aims to reduce hallucinations by making the most of the innate capabilities of the LVLMs via \\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{V}iew Multi-\\textbf{P}ath Reasoning. Specifically, we first devise a multi-view information-seeking strategy to thoroughly perceive the comprehensive information in the image, which enriches the general global information captured by the original vision encoder in LVLMs. Furthermore, during the answer decoding, we observe that the occurrence of hallucinations has a strong correlation with the certainty of the answer tokens. Thus, we propose multi-path reasoning for each information view to quantify and aggregate the certainty scores for each potential answer among multiple decoding paths and finally decide the output answer. By fully grasping the information in the image and carefully considering the certainty of the potential answers when decoding, our MVP can effectively reduce hallucinations in LVLMs.The extensive experiments verify that our proposed MVP significantly mitigates the hallucination problem across four well-known LVLMs. The source code is available at: \\url{https://github.com/GasolSun36/MVP}.",

Research Problem & Motivation**\n\n*   **Specific Technical Problem**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) frequently suffer from \"hallucination,\" where they generate text that is semantically plausible but factually inconsistent or inaccurate with the visual content of an image. This includes misidentifying objects, miscounting quantities, or describing non-existent elements.\n*   **Importance and Challenge**: Hallucinations undermine the trustworthiness and reliability of LVLMs, which are increasingly deployed in critical applications like healthcare, autonomous systems, and robotics. Addressing this issue is crucial to prevent erroneous decisions and ensure the safe and effective use of these models. The challenge lies in mitigating hallucinations without incurring significant computational costs or requiring extensive retraining.\n\n### **2. Related Work & Positioning**\n\n*   **Existing Approaches**:\n    *   **Retraining LVLMs**: Most prior work focuses on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) using custom hallucination-related datasets.\n    *   **Training-free Paradigms**: Some recent methods, like Woodpecker and MARINE, explore training-free approaches.\n*   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n    *   **Retraining**: Inherently comes with substantial computational costs, requires a large number of high-quality training examples, and is time-consuming and labor-intensive.\n    *   **Training-free (prior art)**: Often heavily rely on external, complicated tools (e.g., Grounding DINO, BLIP-2-FlanT5X), introducing additional dependencies and complexity.\n*   **Positioning of this Work**: \\cite{qu2024pqc} proposes a novel *training-free* framework, MVP, that *maximizes the innate capabilities of existing LVLMs* without introducing additional training costs or relying on external tools. It addresses hallucination by tackling two root causes: incomplete comprehension of image content and low certainty during answer token decoding.\n\n### **3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n\n*   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes MVP (Multi-View Multi-Path Reasoning), a training-free framework that enhances LVLM inference by:\n    1.  **Multi-View Information Seeking**: Devising a strategy to thoroughly perceive comprehensive image information from varying dimensions (\"top-down,\" \"regular,\" and \"bottom-up\" views). This information is generated by the LVLMs themselves using dedicated prompts, enriching the global visual context captured by the original vision encoder.\n    2.  **Multi-Path Certainty-Driven Reasoning**: During answer decoding, it observes that hallucinations correlate with low certainty of answer tokens. It quantifies the \"Certainty Score\" (difference between top-two token probabilities) for potential answers. It then generates multiple decoding paths (e.g., by considering top-K candidate first tokens) and aggregates the certainty scores for each potential answer across these paths and across different information views. The answer with the highest aggregated certainty score is selected as the final output.\n*   **Novelty/Differentiation**:\n    *   **Training-free and Tool-free**: Unlike retraining methods or other training-free approaches that use external tools, MVP leverages only the inherent capabilities of the target LVLM.\n    *   **Comprehensive Image Understanding**: Introduces a multi-view strategy to extract richer visual information directly from the LVLM, going beyond the single global representation.\n    *   **Certainty-Driven Decoding**: Explicitly quantifies and utilizes the certainty of answer tokens during decoding, guiding the model to more reliable outputs by exploring multiple reasoning paths.\n\n### **4.

    "layer2_summary": "*Evolution Analysis:*\n\n**Trend 1: Expanding Scope and Granularity of Hallucination Definition and Evaluation**\n\nThe research path reveals a significant trend towards broadening the definition of \"hallucination\" and developing more sophisticated evaluation methodologies. Initially, the focus was on \"object hallucination\" in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where models generated objects inconsistent with or absent from images. [li2023249] initiated this by conducting the first systematic empirical study of object hallucination and proposing **POPE (Polling-based Object Probing Evaluation)**, a novel method that reframed evaluation as a binary \"Yes-or-No\" classification task, offering enhanced stability over prior methods like CHAIR.\n\nHowever, this object-centric view was quickly challenged. [wang2023zop] critically demonstrated that object-based methods like POPE were susceptible to prompt bias, failing to reflect real-world hallucination in complex descriptive responses. This paper introduced **HaELM (Hallucination Evaluation based on Large Language Models)**, a pioneering LLM-based framework designed to evaluate hallucination in these more nuanced, descriptive contexts, leveraging LLMs (ChatGPT) for data generation and fine-tuning a local LLM (LLaMA) as an evaluator. This marked a significant methodological progression, shifting from simple object presence to the intricate task of judging the factual consistency of free-form text.\n\nFurther expanding the problem's scope, [guan2023z15] introduced **HALLUSION BENCH**, a comprehensive diagnostic suite that moved beyond mere object hallucination to systematically dissect \"language hallucination\" (where language priors conflict with visual input) and \"visual illusion\" (misinterpreting visual inputs) in complex image-context reasoning. This benchmark innovated with human-edited images and control groups, enabling a deeper, diagnostic analysis of *why* LVLMs fail, not just *if* they fail. Concurrently, the research broadened beyond multimodal models to address hallucination in *general Large Language Models (LLMs)*. [li2023rvf] introduced **HaluEval**, a large-scale, multi-task benchmark for evaluating both hallucination *generation and recognition* in LLMs across diverse NLP tasks (QA, dialogue, summarization, general queries). A key innovation here was the automated \"sampling-then-filtering\" framework, which leveraged LLMs (ChatGPT) to generate challenging hallucinatory samples, demonstrating a novel approach to benchmark creation itself. The culmination of this trend saw the emergence of comprehensive meta-analyses like [zhang2023k1j] and [ye2023yom], which provided structured taxonomies (e.g., input-conflicting, context-conflicting, fact-conflicting) and mechanistic analyses of hallucination origins, consolidating the field's evolving understanding and laying intellectual groundwork for future research.\n\n**Trend 2: Evolving Mitigation Strategies: From Costly Prevention to Efficient Post-hoc/Decoding-Time Correction**\n\nAnother prominent trend is the evolution of hallucination mitigation strategies, moving from resource-intensive prevention methods to more efficient, practical, and often training-free post-hoc or decoding-time interventions. Early efforts, as highlighted by [zhou2023zu6], faced the challenge that existing mitigation techniques were impractical for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to their auto-regressive nature or the high cost of extensive fine-tuning. [zhou2023zu6] addressed this by proposing **LURE (LVLM Hallucination Revisor)**, a novel *lightweight, post-hoc* algorithm that used a separate, fine-tuned LVLM to reconstruct less hallucinatory descriptions. This approach, while still involving training a revisor, was a step towards more practical solutions.\n\nA significant methodological progression towards efficiency came with *training-free* interventions. [leng2023ohr] introduced **Visual Contrastive Decoding (VCD)**, a novel *decoding-time* technique that mitigated object hallucinations by contrasting output distributions from original and *distorted* visual inputs. This method offered a practical advantage by not requiring additional training or external models. Building on the post-hoc paradigm but making it training-free, [yin2023hx3] proposed **Woodpecker**, a five-stage pipeline for hallucination correction in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Woodpecker innovated by combining the reasoning capabilities of LLMs (GPT-3.5) for concept extraction and correction with the strong perception capabilities of *specialized vision foundation models* (Grounding DINO, BLIP-2) for robust visual knowledge validation, notably enhancing interpretability by adding bounding box evidence to corrected outputs.\n\nThe most advanced and mechanistically insightful development in this trend is **OPERA (Over-trust Penalty and Retrospection-Allocation)**, introduced by [huang2023du3]. This novel *decoding strategy* directly addresses the root cause of MLLM hallucination by identifying \"knowledge aggregation patterns\" in the self-attention mechanism—where models \"over-trust\" summary tokens and neglect image tokens. OPERA intervenes during beam-search decoding with an \"over-trust penalty\" and a \"retrospection-allocation\" strategy to dynamically correct decoding paths, offering a \"nearly free lunch\" solution without additional training, data, or external knowledge. This represents a sophisticated shift towards understanding and correcting hallucination at a fundamental, internal model mechanism level during inference.\n\n*Synthesis:*\nThe unified intellectual trajectory connecting these works is a relentless pursuit of understanding, evaluating, and mitigating the complex phenomenon of hallucination in large AI models. From initial object-level detection to diagnosing entangled multimodal reasoning failures and addressing general LLM factual inconsistencies, the field has rapidly matured. Their collective contribution is the establishment of increasingly robust and nuanced evaluation benchmarks, a deeper causal and mechanistic understanding of hallucination's origins, and the development of a diverse array of practical, efficient, and interpretable mitigation strategies, all vital for advancing the reliability and trustworthiness of AI systems."

    "summary": "**Integration Analysis:**\n\nThe integration of the new papers significantly expands and refines the previously synthesized understanding of \"Hallucination in Large Language Models.\" The initial two trends—\"From Static Knowledge Integration to Dynamic, Real-time Factual Correction\" and \"Deepening the Understanding and Taxonomy of LLM Hallucinations\"—are not only extended but also branch into new, critical dimensions.\n\n*   **Extension of Existing Trends:**\n    *   **Dynamic/Real-time Correction:** Papers like [ding20244yr] \"Retrieve Only When It Needs\" (2024), [sui20242u1] \"Can Knowledge Graphs Make Large Language Models More Trustworthy?\" (2024), [ghosh2024tj5] \"Logical Consistency of Large Language Models in Fact-checking\" (2024), [tjandra2024umq] \"Fine-Tuning Large Language Models to Appropriately Abstain with Semantic Entropy\" (2024), and [zhang2024qq9] \"Knowledge Overshadowing Causes Amalgamated Hallucination in Large Language Models\" (2024) all build upon the concept of dynamic, real-time intervention. They introduce more sophisticated adaptive retrieval mechanisms, integrate structured knowledge graphs for enhanced trustworthiness, focus on logical consistency, propose abstention as a form of self-correction, and identify/mitigate specific mechanistic causes of hallucination during inference.\n    *   **Deepening Understanding & Taxonomy:** The new surveys—[tonmoy20244e4] \"A Comprehensive Survey of Hallucination Mitigation Techniques in Large Language Models\" (2024), [liu2024p39] \"A Survey of Hallucination Problems Based on Large Language Models\" (2024), and especially [li2025qzg] \"Loki's Dance of Illusions\" (2025)—provide even more comprehensive categorizations, delve deeper into the *mechanistic origins* of hallucinations, and critically, introduce the concept of their *mathematical inevitability*. [zhang2024qq9] further contributes by identifying a specific, novel cause: \"knowledge overshadowing.\"\n\n*   **New Methodological/Conceptual Shifts:**\n    *   **Multimodal Hallucination (LVLMs):** A major new conceptual shift is the dedicated focus on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Papers like [chang2024u3t] \"Dentist\" (2024), [zhong2024mfi] \"Investigating and Mitigating the Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing in Large Vision-Language Models\" (2024), [lan20240yz] \"A Survey of Hallucination in Large Visual Language Models\" (2024), [wang2024vym] \"VaLiD\" (2024), and [chen2024j0g] \"ICT\" (2024) establish this as a distinct and critical area, recognizing that multimodal hallucinations have unique causes (e.g., modality gap, visual encoding distortion) and require specialized mitigation and evaluation strategies.\n    *   **Advanced Evaluation & Benchmarking:** A strong new methodological emphasis emerges on creating more rigorous, automatically verifiable, and context-aware benchmarks. [sui20242u1] introduces OKGQA for open-ended KGQA, [oh2024xa3] \"ERBench\" (2024) innovates by automatically verifying LLM *rationales* using relational databases, [kaul2024ta7] \"THRONE\" (2024) provides an object-based benchmark for *free-form* LVLM generations, and [yang20251dw] \"Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models with Metamorphic Relations\" (2025) offers a zero-resource, self-contained *detection* method. [tjandra2024umq] also introduces a novel metric (AED) for abstention-capable models.\n    *   **Logical Consistency:** [ghosh2024tj5] introduces the concept of evaluating and improving LLM *logical consistency* in fact-checking, expanding the definition of \"hallucination\" beyond just factual errors.\n    *   **Inference-time Internal Interventions:** [wang2024vym] and [chen2024j0g] introduce methods that intervene directly within the model's forward pass or decoding process, targeting specific internal mechanisms (e.g., visual encoder layers, attention heads) to mitigate hallucinations, moving beyond external retrieval or post-hoc correction.\n\n*   **Gaps Filled and New Directions Opened:**\n    *   **Gaps Filled:** The previous synthesis lacked a dedicated focus on multimodal models and sophisticated evaluation beyond simple accuracy. These gaps are now robustly addressed. The understanding of *why* hallucinations occur is deepened with specific causal mechanisms ([zhang2024qq9], [wang2024vym]).\n    *   **New Directions Opened:** The exploration of the *mathematical inevitability* of hallucination ([li2025qzg]) opens a profound theoretical avenue. The development of self-contained, zero-resource detection methods ([yang20251dw]) and the emphasis on verifying *rationales* ([oh2024xa3]) point towards future LLMs that are not only accurate but also transparent and logically sound.\n\n*   **Connections between new papers and earlier works:**\n    *   [ding20244yr] directly builds on the adaptive retrieval concepts mentioned in [gao20232zb] and the real-time verification in [kang202378c].\n    *   [zhong2024mfi] extends the \"snowballing\" concept from LLMs ([kang202378c]) to the multimodal domain.\n    *   [sui20242u1] and [ghosh2024tj5] further elaborate on the RAG paradigm introduced in [gao20232zb].\n    *   The new surveys ([tonmoy20244e4], [liu2024p39], [li2025qzg]) synthesize and build upon the foundational taxonomies and problem analyses presented in [huang2023akj] and [ye2023yom].\n\n*   **Changes to the overall narrative:** The narrative shifts from a primary focus on LLM factual accuracy and general understanding of hallucination to a more holistic pursuit of **trustworthy AI**. This now encompasses multimodal reliability, deep mechanistic understanding of hallucination causes (including fundamental limits), sophisticated evaluation of reasoning and rationales, and the development of self-aware models capable of abstaining when uncertain. The field is moving towards not just mitigating errors, but building models that are inherently more verifiable, logically consistent, and contextually grounded across diverse modalities.\n\n**Temporal Positioning:**\nAll new papers are published in 2024 or 2025, placing them as the most recent advancements in the field, extending the chronological scope of the analysis from 2023 to 2025. They represent the cutting edge of research, building upon and expanding the foundational work from 2022-2023.\n\n---\n\n**Updated Evolution Analysis:**\n\nThe evolution of research into \"Hallucination in Large Language Models\" has rapidly matured, revealing four major, intertwined trends: a progression from *reactive grounding to proactive, adaptive, and mechanistic mitigation*; a deepening conceptualization from *problem taxonomy to causal mechanisms and inevitability*; the *emergence of multimodal hallucination* as a distinct challenge; and a growing focus on *sophisticated evaluation and benchmarking for trustworthiness*.\n\n**Trend 1: From Reactive Grounding to Proactive, Adaptive, and Mechanistic Mitigation**\n\n*   *Methodological progression*: Initially, LLMs struggled with knowledge-intensive tasks, leading to hallucinations. [trivedi2022qsf] \"Interleaving Retrieval with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Knowledge-Intensive Multi-Step Questions\" (2022) introduced dynamic interleaving of reasoning and retrieval. This was advanced by [kang202378c] \"Ever: Mitigating Hallucination in Large Language Models through Real-Time Verification and Rectification\" (2023), which innovated with real-time, concept-level validation and rectification during generation, actively correcting errors as they emerged. The broader context of these methods was systematically categorized by [gao20232zb] \"Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models: A Survey\" (2023), detailing RAG's evolution.\n    *   **New contributions** further refine this trend. [ding20244yr] \"Retrieve Only When It Needs\" (2024) introduces **Rowen**, an adaptive RAG framework that uses a novel consistency-based detection module (cross-language, cross-model) to dynamically decide *when* to retrieve, optimizing efficiency and mitigating both internal and external hallucinations. This is a significant step beyond always-on RAG or simpler confidence-based methods. [sui20242u1] \"Can Knowledge Graphs Make Large Language Models More Trustworthy?\" (2024) explores augmenting LLMs with Knowledge Graphs (KGs), proposing a unified RAG-like framework with \"Graph-guided retrieval\" and \"Graph-guided generation\" to enhance trustworthiness and reduce hallucinations in open-ended QA. This moves beyond generic retrieval to structured knowledge integration. [tjandra2024umq] \"Fine-Tuning Large Language Models to Appropriately Abstain with Semantic Entropy\" (2024) introduces a novel fine-tuning strategy that enables LLMs to *abstain* from answering when uncertain, leveraging *semantic entropy* for label-free uncertainty estimation, representing a proactive self-correction mechanism. [zhang2024qq9] \"Knowledge Overshadowing Causes Amalgamated Hallucination in Large Language Models\" (2024) proposes an inference-time, training-free self-contrastive decoding method, combined with PMI-based detection, to alleviate \"amalgamated hallucinations\" caused by \"knowledge overshadowing,\" demonstrating a targeted, mechanistic intervention.\n*   *Problem evolution*: [trivedi2022qsf] addressed LLMs' struggle with knowledge-intensive QA. [kang202378c] tackled the \"snowballing\" effect of hallucinations. [gao20232zb] contextualized RAG's role in overcoming LLM limitations.\n    *   **New contributions** address more nuanced problems. [ding20244yr] tackles the inefficiency of always-on RAG and the limitations of existing consistency-based detection methods. [sui20242u1] addresses the challenge of evaluating KG-augmented LLMs in complex, open-ended QA, especially under imperfect KG conditions. [tjandra2024umq] targets the critical problem of LLMs generating confident but incorrect answers, particularly in long-form generations, and the limitations of label-dependent abstention methods. [zhang2024qq9] identifies a specific, previously underexplored problem: \"amalgamated hallucination\" caused by \"knowledge overshadowing\" due to data imbalance and over-generalization, even with factually correct training data.\n*   *Key innovations*: [trivedi2022qsf] introduced dynamic CoT-retrieval. [kang202378c] innovated with real-time, concept-level verification. [gao20232zb] provided a RAG taxonomy.\n    *   **New innovations** include [ding20244yr]'s consistency-based hallucination detection (cross-language, cross-model) for adaptive retrieval; [sui20242u1]'s prize-cost trade-off for graph-guided retrieval; [tjandra2024umq]'s use of *semantic entropy* for label-free abstention and the Accuracy-Engagement Distance (AED) metric; and [zhang2024qq9]'s identification of \"knowledge overshadowing\" and its inference-time self-contrastive decoding mitigation.\n*   *Integration points*: [ding20244yr] directly builds on adaptive retrieval concepts from [gao20232zb] and real-time verification from [kang202378c]. [sui20242u1] and [tjandra2024umq] extend the RAG paradigm discussed in [gao20232zb] by focusing on specific knowledge sources (KGs) or self-correction mechanisms (abstention). [zhang2024qq9] offers a mechanistic explanation and mitigation that complements the broader RAG strategies.\n\n**Trend 2: Deepening Conceptualization: From Problem Taxonomy to Causal Mechanisms and Inevitability**\n\n*   *Methodological progression*: The field moved from surveying solutions ([gao20232zb]) to surveying the problem itself ([huang2023akj] \"A Survey on Hallucination in Large Language Models,\" 2023; [ye2023yom] \"Cognitive Mirage,\" 2023), providing taxonomies and cause-aligned mitigation.\n    *   **New contributions** significantly deepen this understanding. [tonmoy20244e4] \"A Comprehensive Survey of Hallucination Mitigation Techniques in Large Language Models\" (2024) offers a broad taxonomy of mitigation techniques, including for VLMs. [liu2024p39] \"A Survey of Hallucination Problems Based on Large Language Models\" (2024) provides another comprehensive review, structuring causes across data, training, and inference. Most profoundly, [li2025qzg] \"Loki's Dance of Illusions: A Comprehensive Survey of Hallucination in Large Language Models\" (2025) introduces a *novel unified theoretical framework*, including a formal mathematical definition of hallucination and exploring its *mathematical origins and inevitabilities*, suggesting fundamental constraints on complete eradication. [zhang2024qq9] contributes a specific mechanistic cause, \"knowledge overshadowing,\" linking it to data imbalance and over-generalization.\n*   *Problem evolution*: Earlier surveys addressed the need for unified understanding and distinguishing hallucination types.\n    *   **New contributions** address the need for a more granular, mechanistic understanding of *why* hallucinations occur, even with good data. [li2025qzg] tackles the fundamental question of whether hallucinations can ever be fully eliminated. [zhang2024qq9] pinpoints a specific, insidious cause of hallucination that persists despite factually correct training data.\n*   *Key innovations*: [huang2023akj] introduced factuality vs. faithfulness. [ye2023yom] provided a task-specific taxonomy and detailed theoretical analysis of origins.\n    *   **New innovations** include [tonmoy20244e4]'s comprehensive taxonomy of mitigation techniques; [liu2024p39]'s structured analysis of causes across the LLM lifecycle; and [li2025qzg]'s formal mathematical definition of hallucination, its unified theoretical framework, and the exploration of its mathematical inevitability. [zhang2024qq9]'s identification of \"knowledge overshadowing\" as a distinct cause is also a key innovation.\n*   *Integration points*: The new surveys ([tonmoy20244e4], [liu2024p39], [li2025qzg]) directly build upon and extend the conceptual frameworks and taxonomies established by [huang2023akj] and [ye2023yom], providing more recent and deeper insights. [zhang2024qq9]'s specific causal analysis adds a new dimension to the general causes outlined in earlier surveys.\n\n**Trend 3: Emergence of Multimodal Hallucination (LVLMs)**\n\n*   *Methodological progression*: This trend represents a significant new branch, as the previous synthesis focused solely on LLMs. Researchers recognized that hallucinations manifest uniquely in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) and require specialized solutions. [chang2024u3t] \"A Unified Hallucination Mitigation Framework for Large Vision-Language Models\" (2024) introduces **Dentist**, a framework that classifies query types (perception vs. reasoning) and applies tailored mitigation strategies (visual verification, CoT) within an iterative validation loop. [zhong2024mfi] \"Investigating and Mitigating the Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing in Large Vision-Language Models\" (2024) proposes **Residual Visual Decoding (RVD)**, a training-free method to mitigate \"multimodal hallucination snowballing\" by emphasizing direct visual evidence. [lan20240yz] \"A Survey of Hallucination in Large Visual Language Models\" (2024) provides the first dedicated survey for LVLM hallucination, categorizing causes (modality gap, dataset toxicity, LLM hallucination) and correction methods. [wang2024vym] \"VaLiD\" (2024) proposes **Visual-Layer Fusion Contrastive Decoding (VaLiD)**, a visual-centric method that identifies \"Visual Encoding Distortion\" within the vision encoder and fuses features from early visual layers to correct it. [chen2024j0g] \"ICT: Image-Object Cross-Level Trusted Intervention\" (2024) introduces a training-free, forward-pass intervention method that targets specific attention heads to enhance focus on image-level and object-level visual information.\n*   *Problem evolution*: This trend addresses the entirely new problem of hallucinations in LVLMs, which can be \"perception hallucinations\" or \"reasoning hallucinations\" ([chang2024u3t]). [zhong2024mfi] specifically identifies \"multimodal hallucination snowballing,\" where LVLMs are misled by their own previous multimodal errors, extending the \"snowballing\" concept from [kang202378c] to the multimodal domain. [wang2024vym] highlights \"Visual Encoding Distortion\" as a critical, overlooked source of LVLM hallucinations. [chen2024j0g] addresses the problem of overly strong language priors dominating weaker visual encoders.\n*   *Key innovations*: [chang2024u3t] innovates with query-type classification and iterative refinement for LVLMs. [zhong2024mfi] introduces the MMHalSnowball framework and Residual Visual Decoding. [lan20240yz] provides a novel taxonomy for LVLM hallucination causes and correction. [wang2024vym] identifies Visual Encoding Distortion and proposes uncertainty-guided visual-layer fusion contrastive decoding. [chen2024j0g] introduces a training-free, forward-pass intervention on attention heads for cross-level visual focus.\n*   *Integration points*: This trend is largely new, branching off from the general LLM hallucination problem. [zhong2024mfi] explicitly connects to the \"snowballing\" problem identified in [kang202378c], extending it to the multimodal context.\n\n**Trend 4: Sophisticated Evaluation and Benchmarking for Trustworthiness**\n\n*   *Methodological progression*: While earlier papers implicitly used benchmarks, a dedicated focus on creating robust, verifiable, and nuanced evaluation tools emerged. [sui20242u1] \"Can Knowledge Graphs Make Large Language Models More Trustworthy?\" (2024) introduces **OKGQA**, a novel benchmark for open-ended KG-augmented QA, and **OKGQA-P** for evaluating robustness under perturbed KGs. [ghosh2024tj5] \"Logical Consistency of Large Language Models in Fact-checking\" (2024) proposes new logical fact-checking datasets (LFC) and quantitative measures to assess LLM consistency on complex propositional logic queries. [oh2024xa3] \"ERBench: An Entity-Relationship based Automatically Verifiable Hallucination Benchmark\" (2024) innovates by using relational databases to construct complex, automatically verifiable questions and, crucially, to verify the *rationales* provided by LLMs. [yang20251dw] \"Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models with Metamorphic Relations\" (2025) introduces **MetaQA**, a zero-resource, self-contained hallucination detection method that leverages *metamorphic relations* (synonym/antonym mutations) and prompt mutation, acting as an internal evaluation oracle. [kaul2024ta7] \"THRONE: An Object-Based Hallucination Benchmark for the Free-Form Generations of Large Vision-Language Models\" (2024) provides the first accurate benchmark for \"Type I\" (free-form) object hallucinations in LVLMs, using LM-based semantic judgment. [tjandra2024umq] also introduces the Accuracy-Engagement Distance (AED) metric for evaluating abstention-capable models.\n*   *Problem evolution*: This trend addresses the limitations of simplistic benchmarks and the need to evaluate deeper aspects of LLM trustworthiness beyond just factual accuracy, such as logical consistency, reasoning paths, and the ability to express uncertainty. [oh2024xa3] tackles the challenge of automatically verifying LLM rationales, a critical step for transparency. [kaul2024ta7] highlights the inadequacy of existing benchmarks for free-form LVLM generations and the anti-correlation between different types of hallucinations. [yang20251dw] addresses the reliance of detection methods on external resources or inaccessible internal model states.\n*   *Key innovations*: [sui20242u1]'s OKGQA and OKGQA-P benchmarks. [ghosh2024tj5]'s LFC datasets and logical consistency measures. [oh2024xa3]'s ERBench framework for automatic rationale verification. [yang20251dw]'s MetaQA using metamorphic relations for zero-resource detection. [kaul2024ta7]'s THRONE benchmark for Type I LVLM hallucinations and its LM-based semantic judgment. [tjandra2024umq]'s AED metric.\n*   *Integration points*: These new benchmarks and evaluation methods provide the necessary tools to rigorously test the mitigation strategies proposed in Trend 1 and the conceptual understanding developed in Trend 2, and are essential for the emerging LVLM research in Trend 3. [ghosh2024tj5] directly evaluates RAG-LLMs, linking to [gao20232zb].\n\n---\n\n**Refined Synthesis:**\n\nThis expanded chain of research illustrates a rapid and sophisticated intellectual trajectory, evolving from developing practical, dynamic solutions for grounding LLM reasoning and correcting factual errors in real-time to a comprehensive, theoretical, and multimodal understanding of hallucination itself. The field is now deeply engaged in understanding the *mechanistic causes* of hallucination, exploring its *mathematical inevitability*, developing *specialized solutions for multimodal models*, and creating *rigorous, automatically verifiable benchmarks* that assess not just factual accuracy but also logical consistency, reasoning transparency, and the ability of models to appropriately abstain when uncertain. Collectively, these works significantly advance the field by providing both effective, adaptive mitigation strategies and a robust conceptual and evaluative framework for building increasingly trustworthy and reliable Large Language and Vision-Language Models.",

        "title": "Interleaving Retrieval with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Knowledge-Intensive Multi-Step Questions",
        "abstract": "Prompting-based large language models (LLMs) are surprisingly powerful at generating natural language reasoning steps or Chains-of-Thoughts (CoT) for multi-step question answering (QA). They struggle, however, when the necessary knowledge is either unavailable to the LLM or not up-to-date within its parameters. While using the question to retrieve relevant text from an external knowledge source helps LLMs, we observe that this one-step retrieve-and-read approach is insufficient for multi-step QA. Here, what to retrieve depends on what has already been derived, which in turn may depend on what was previously retrieved. To address this, we propose IRCoT, a new approach for multi-step QA that interleaves retrieval with steps (sentences) in a CoT, guiding the retrieval with CoT and in turn using retrieved results to improve CoT. Using IRCoT with GPT3 substantially improves retrieval (up to 21 points) as well as downstream QA (up to 15 points) on four datasets: HotpotQA, 2WikiMultihopQA, MuSiQue, and IIRC. We observe similar substantial gains in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings as well as with much smaller models such as Flan-T5-large without additional training. IRCoT reduces model hallucination, resulting in factually more accurate CoT reasoning.",

For complex questions, what needs to be retrieved often depends on intermediate reasoning steps already derived, which in turn might depend on previously retrieved information. This creates a circular dependency where reasoning needs facts, and facts need reasoning to be identified, leading to potential hallucination without proper grounding \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**:\n        *   **Prompting-based Open-Domain QA**: Approaches like SelfAsk \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}, DecomP \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}, and ReAct \\cite{trivedi2022qsf} decompose questions or generate action sequences.\n        *   **Supervised Multi-Step Open-Domain QA**: Prior work (e.g., Das et al., 2019; Xiong et al., 2021; Qi et al., 2019) explored iterative retrieval, often using neural query reformulation or entity linking.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   **Prompting-based**: SelfAsk and DecomP are not designed for CoT reasoning, do not focus on the dynamic retrieval problem during reasoning, and often require single-hop QA models. ReAct relies on much larger models (e.g., PaLM-540B) and often requires fine-tuning \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}. These methods are not shown to be effective for smaller models without training.\n        *   **Supervised Iterative Retrieval**: These methods typically rely on extensive supervised training on large-scale datasets, making them unsuitable for few-shot settings \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}.\n    *   **Positioning**: IRCoT distinguishes itself by proposing a novel, few-shot, training-free approach that *interleaves* CoT generation with retrieval, allowing each to dynamically inform the other, specifically addressing the limitations of one-shot retrieval and the training requirements of supervised iterative methods \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method (IRCoT)**: IRCoT (Interleaved Retrieval guided by Chain-of-Thought) is an iterative process that alternates between generating a CoT step and retrieving knowledge.\n        1.  **Initial Retrieval**: Begins by retrieving a base set of `K` paragraphs using the original question as the query \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}.\n        2.  **Iterative Interleaving**:\n            *   **Reason Step**: A language model generates the next CoT sentence, conditioned on the original question, all paragraphs collected so far, and all CoT sentences generated so far \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}.\n            *   **Retrieve Step**: The *last generated CoT sentence* is then used as a new query to retrieve `K` additional paragraphs, which are added to the cumulative set of retrieved documents \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}.\n        3.  **Termination**: This loop continues until the CoT explicitly states an answer (e.g., \"answer is:\") or a maximum number of reasoning steps is reached \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}.\n        4.  **Final QA**: All collected paragraphs are then passed to a separate QA reader (using either CoT or Direct Prompting) to generate the final answer \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}.\n    *   **Novelty**: The key innovation is the *dynamic, bidirectional interleaving* of CoT reasoning and retrieval. Instead of a static, one-time retrieval or pre-defined sub-questions, IRCoT uses the evolving CoT to generate more precise and context-aware queries for subsequent retrieval, and the newly retrieved information in turn grounds and improves the next CoT step \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}. This allows for adaptive information seeking during complex multi-step reasoning.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithm**: Introduction of IRCoT, a novel retrieval method that dynamically interleaves CoT generation with knowledge retrieval for multi-step QA \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}.\n    *   **Dynamic Query Generation**: Leverages intermediate CoT sentences as queries for subsequent retrieval, enabling more targeted and relevant information gathering as the reasoning process unfolds \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}.\n    *   **Improved Factual Accuracy**: By grounding reasoning steps in retrieved external knowledge, IRCoT significantly reduces model hallucination, leading to more factually accurate CoT reasoning \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}.\n    *   **Few-shot and Training-free**: Achieves substantial performance gains in a few-shot setting without requiring any additional training or fine-tuning of the underlying LLMs \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Evaluated IRCoT on four multi-step, open-domain QA datasets: HotpotQA, 2WikiMultihopQA, MuSiQue, and IIRC \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}. Comparisons were made against a one-step retriever (OneR) and a retriever-less baseline (NoR QA).\n    *   **Models Used**: OpenAI GPT3 (code-davinci-002, 175B parameters) and various Flan-T5 models (0.7B, 3B, 11B parameters) were used as CoT generators and QA readers. BM25 served as the base retriever \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**: Retrieval performance was measured by fixed-budget optimal recall (max 15 paragraphs). QA performance was measured by F1 score. Factual error reduction in CoT was also assessed \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}.\n    *   **Comparison Results**:\n        *   **Retrieval**: IRCoT substantially improved retrieval recall by 11-21 points compared to the one-step retriever \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}.\n        *   **QA Performance**: Led to significant improvements in downstream few-shot QA performance, up to 15 F1 points \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}.\n        *   **Factual Accuracy**: Reduced factual errors in generated CoTs by up to 50% \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}.\n        *   **Model Scalability**: Demonstrated effectiveness with both large (GPT3) and smaller (Flan-T5-*) models. Notably, Flan-T5-XL (3B) with IRCoT outperformed the 58X larger GPT3 using a one-step retriever \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}.\n        *   **Robustness**: Improvements were consistent in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}.\n        *   **State-of-the-Art**: QA scores exceeded those reported by recent few-shot ODQA works like SelfAsk and ReAct \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Fixed Budget**: The retrieval process is constrained by a maximum number of retrieved paragraphs (e.g., 15) and a maximum number of reasoning steps (e.g., 8) \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}.\n    *   **Base Retriever Dependency**: Performance is somewhat dependent on the quality of the underlying base retriever (BM25 in this work) \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}.\n    *   **Prompt Engineering**: Requires a small set of annotated questions with reasoning steps for in-context demonstrations \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: Primarily focused on knowledge-intensive, multi-step QA in open-domain, few-shot settings. It is not designed for tasks where all information is provided in the context or where purely parametric knowledge is sufficient \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art**: Significantly pushes the boundaries of few-shot, open-domain QA for complex, multi-step questions by effectively integrating dynamic knowledge retrieval with LLM reasoning \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}.\n    *   **Reduces LLM Hallucination**: Provides a robust mechanism to ground LLM-generated reasoning in external, verifiable facts, leading to more reliable and accurate outputs \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}.\n    *   **Democratizes Advanced QA**: Demonstrates that sophisticated multi-step QA capabilities can be achieved even with much smaller LLMs (like Flan-T5) when coupled with an intelligent retrieval strategy, potentially reducing the reliance on extremely large, costly models \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}.\n    *   **Impact on Future Research**: Establishes a strong paradigm for future research into more tightly integrated and adaptive reasoning-retrieval systems, moving beyond static information retrieval to truly dynamic knowledge seeking during complex cognitive tasks \\cite{trivedi2022qsf}.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in generating fluent text. However, they often encounter the challenge of generating inaccurate or hallucinated content. This issue is common in both non-retrieval-based generation and retrieval-augmented generation approaches, and existing post-hoc rectification methods may not address the accumulated hallucination errors that may be caused by the\"snowballing\"issue, especially in reasoning tasks. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel approach called Real-time Verification and Rectification (Ever). Instead of waiting until the end of the generation process to rectify hallucinations, Ever employs a real-time, step-wise generation and hallucination rectification strategy. The primary objective is to detect and rectify hallucinations as they occur during the text generation process. When compared to both retrieval-based and non-retrieval-based baselines, Ever demonstrates a significant improvement in generating trustworthy and factually accurate text across a diverse range of tasks, including short-form QA, biography generation, and multi-hop reasoning.",

        "summary": "This paper, \"Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models: A Survey\" \\cite{gao20232zb}, offers a comprehensive review of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Large Language Models (LLMs).\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but are plagued by issues such as hallucination (generating factually incorrect content), reliance on outdated knowledge, and a lack of transparency or traceability in their reasoning processes. These limitations are particularly pronounced in knowledge-intensive or domain-specific tasks.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** The inability of LLMs to consistently provide accurate, up-to-date, and verifiable information restricts their reliability and widespread adoption in real-world applications. The challenge lies in developing a mechanism that allows LLMs to dynamically access and integrate external, up-to-date knowledge without requiring continuous and costly retraining, thereby enhancing their accuracy, credibility, and adaptability.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** RAG is presented as a synergistic solution that combines the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs with vast, dynamic external knowledge bases. The paper traces RAG's evolution from early efforts to enhance pre-training models (PTMs) in the Transformer era to its rapid development post-ChatGPT, where it primarily focused on improving LLM inference and later integrated with fine-tuning techniques.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n        *   **Native LLMs:** Inherently limited by their training data, leading to \"hallucinations\" and an inability to address queries requiring current or domain-specific information.\n        *   **Naive RAG:** The initial RAG paradigm suffered from significant drawbacks, including poor retrieval precision and recall (leading to irrelevant or missing context), generation difficulties (e.g., hallucination, irrelevance, bias), and challenges in augmenting LLM outputs coherently (e.g., redundancy, lack of synthesis).\n        *   **Fine-tuning (FT):** While effective for customizing model behavior and style, FT is static (requiring retraining for updates), computationally intensive, and empirically shown to be less effective than RAG for learning new factual information, especially in dynamic knowledge environments.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method/Algorithm:** The paper systematically categorizes the evolution of RAG into three paradigms:\n        *   **Naive RAG:** A foundational \"Retrieve-Read\" framework comprising indexing (data cleaning, chunking, embedding, vector storage), retrieval (semantic similarity search for top-K relevant chunks), and generation (LLM synthesizes query and retrieved context).\n        *   **Advanced RAG:** Builds upon Naive RAG by introducing specific optimizations. These include pre-retrieval strategies (e.g., refined indexing techniques like sliding windows and metadata incorporation, and query optimization methods like rewriting, transformation, and expansion) and post-retrieval processes (e.g., re-ranking retrieved chunks and context compression).\n        *   **Modular RAG:** Represents the state-of-the-art, offering enhanced adaptability and versatility. It introduces specialized functional modules (e.g., Search, RAG-Fusion, Memory, Routing, Predict, Task Adapter) and flexible interaction patterns (e.g., Rewrite-Retrieve-Read, Generate-Read, Recite-Read, hybrid retrieval, iterative/adaptive retrieval flows like FLARE and Self-RAG).\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:** The primary innovation of this work is its comprehensive and structured survey of the RAG landscape. It highlights the progression from a fixed, sequential RAG process to a highly flexible, modular architecture.

        "abstract": "The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has marked a significant breakthrough in natural language processing (NLP), fueling a paradigm shift in information acquisition. Nevertheless, LLMs are prone to hallucination, generating plausible yet nonfactual content. This phenomenon raises significant concerns over the reliability of LLMs in real-world information retrieval (IR) systems and has attracted intensive research to detect and mitigate such hallucinations. Given the open-ended general-purpose attributes inherent to LLMs, LLM hallucinations present distinct challenges that diverge from prior task-specific models. This divergence highlights the urgency for a nuanced understanding and comprehensive overview of recent advances in LLM hallucinations. In this survey, we begin with an innovative taxonomy of hallucination in the era of LLM and then delve into the factors contributing to hallucinations. Subsequently, we present a thorough overview of hallucination detection methods and benchmarks. Our discussion then transfers to representative methodologies for mitigating LLM hallucinations. Additionally, we delve into the current limitations faced by retrieval-augmented LLMs in combating hallucinations, offering insights for developing more robust IR systems. Finally, we highlight the promising research directions on LLM hallucinations, including hallucination in large vision-language models and understanding of knowledge boundaries in LLM hallucinations.",

        "title": "Retrieve Only When It Needs: Adaptive Retrieval Augmentation for Hallucination Mitigation in Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "Hallucinations pose a significant challenge for the practical implementation of large language models (LLMs). The utilization of parametric knowledge in generating factual content is constrained by the limited knowledge of LLMs, potentially resulting in internal hallucinations. While incorporating external information can help fill knowledge gaps, it also introduces the risk of irrelevant information, thereby increasing the likelihood of external hallucinations. A careful and balanced integration of the parametric knowledge within LLMs with external information is crucial to alleviate hallucinations. In this study, we present Rowen, a novel approach that enhances LLMs with a selective retrieval augmentation process tailored to address hallucinated outputs. This process is governed by a multilingual semantic-aware detection module, which evaluates the consistency of the perturbed responses across various languages for the same queries. Upon detecting inconsistencies indicative of hallucinations, Rowen activates the retrieval of external information to rectify the model outputs. Rowen adeptly harmonizes the intrinsic parameters in LLMs with external knowledge sources, effectively mitigating hallucinations by ensuring a balanced integration of internal reasoning and external evidence. Through a comprehensive empirical analysis, we demonstrate that Rowen surpasses the current state-of-the-art in both detecting and mitigating hallucinated content within the outputs of LLMs.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review, emphasizing technical innovations and empirical validation:\n\n### Focused Summary for Literature Review\n\n**1. Research Problem & Motivation**\n*   **Specific Technical Problem:** Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently generate factually incorrect or nonsensical outputs, known as hallucinations. These can be categorized into:\n    *   **Internal Hallucinations:** Arise from LLMs' limited parametric knowledge, especially for recent or domain-specific information \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n    *   **External Hallucinations:** Occur in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems when irrelevant or erroneous external information is incorporated, leading to compromised output accuracy \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n*   **Importance & Challenge:** Hallucinations pose significant risks in practical LLM deployments, undermining trust and reliability. The challenge lies in effectively balancing the utilization of LLMs' internal parametric knowledge with external information to mitigate both types of hallucinations without introducing new errors or unnecessary computational overhead \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n\n**2. Related Work & Positioning**\n*   **Existing Approaches:**\n    *   **Self-improvement methods (e.g., self-reflection, multi-model debate):** Leverage LLMs' parametric knowledge and reasoning capabilities to enhance logical consistency \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n    *   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Integrates external documents to overcome knowledge limitations \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n    *   **Adaptive Retrieval Methods:** Assess question difficulty or response confidence to decide when to retrieve documents \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n*   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n    *   Self-improvement methods are often constrained by LLMs' inherent knowledge boundaries and reasoning chain complexity, leading to internal hallucinations \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n    *   RAG methods are susceptible to external hallucinations due to the risk of incorporating irrelevant evidence, leading to error accumulation \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n    *   Existing consistency-based methods may fail when LLMs provide consistent but incorrect answers, often due to focusing solely on semantic coherence within a single language or model \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n\n**3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n*   **Core Technical Method:** The paper introduces **Rowen** (Retrieve only when it needs), an adaptive retrieval augmentation framework that enhances LLMs by dynamically deciding when to retrieve external information based on a novel consistency-based hallucination detection module \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n*   **Novelty/Differentiation:**\n    *   **Adaptive Retrieval Trigger:** Unlike always-on RAG or simpler confidence-based adaptive methods, Rowen activates retrieval *only* when high uncertainty (inconsistency) is detected in LLM responses, balancing internal reasoning and external evidence \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n    *   **Consistency-based Hallucination Detection:** Rowen's detection module goes beyond single-language/model consistency by evaluating semantic inconsistencies across:\n        *   **Cross-Language (Rowen-CL):** Responses to the same query translated into different languages \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n        *   **Cross-Model (Rowen-CM):** Responses to the same query generated by different LLMs (e.g., a primary model and a verifier model) \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n    *   **Three-Stage Framework:**\n        1.  **Stage 1: Generating Initial Answer:** Uses Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to produce a preliminary response \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n        2.  **Stage 2: Deciding Whether to Retrieve:** Employs the consistency-based detection module (cross-language, cross-model, or hybrid) to assess the reliability of the initial response. If the consistency score falls below a threshold, retrieval is triggered \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n        3.  **Stage 3: Retrieval Augmented Generation:** If retrieval is triggered, relevant external knowledge is searched (e.g., via web search API) and used to repair and refine the initial hallucinated content \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n\n**4. Key Technical Contributions**\n*   **Novel Algorithms/Methods:**\n    *   A novel **consistency-based hallucination detection module** that leverages semantic inconsistencies across diverse language verbalizations and different LLMs (cross-language and cross-model consistency checks) to estimate model uncertainty \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n    *   An **adaptive retrieval strategy** that intelligently decides *when* to engage external knowledge retrieval, thereby mitigating both internal and external hallucinations and optimizing retrieval efficiency \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n*   **System Design/Architectural Innovations:** The Rowen framework integrates CoT reasoning, multi-faceted consistency checking, and targeted retrieval-augmented generation into a cohesive pipeline for robust hallucination mitigation \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n\n**5.

It also reported BLEU and Rouge-L scores \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n    *   **StrategyQA:** Rowen achieved an accuracy of 75.60%, surpassing existing self-improvement and RAG-based baselines \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n    *   **Efficiency:** The adaptive retrieval strategy significantly reduced unnecessary retrievals, enhancing the efficiency of RAG systems \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n    *   **Baselines:** Compared against Vanilla LLMs (ChatGPT), Self-improvement methods (CoVe, Multi-agent Debate, Self-Reflection), Retrieval-augmented methods (Factool, Detect-and-Mitigate), and Adaptive retrieval methods (FLARE, Adaptive-Retrieval, Self-RAG, Adaptive-RAG, LUQ) \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n    *   **Implementation Details:** Used ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo) as the primary LLM, Qwen-Max-0428 as the verifier LM for cross-model checks, and Google Search API for retrieval \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n\n**6. Limitations & Scope**\n*   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The paper does not explicitly state limitations of the Rowen framework itself within the provided abstract and introduction. However, potential implicit limitations could include:\n    *   Reliance on the quality of semantic perturbations and translations for consistency checks.\n    *   The effectiveness of the consistency check depends on the chosen verifier model (for Rowen-CM) and the target language (for Rowen-CL).\n    *   The performance is sensitive to hyperparameters like the consistency score threshold and the weight factor `α` for hybrid detection \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n*   **Scope of Applicability:** Rowen is designed for factual question-answering and generation tasks where hallucination mitigation is critical. Its adaptive nature makes it suitable for scenarios where balancing internal knowledge and external retrieval is beneficial for accuracy and efficiency \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n\n**7. Technical Significance**\n*   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** Rowen significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in both detecting and mitigating hallucinations in LLM outputs, as evidenced by its superior performance on TruthfulQA and StrategyQA datasets \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n*   **Potential Impact on Future Research:**\n    *   Introduces a novel paradigm for adaptive retrieval, moving beyond simple confidence scores to multi-faceted consistency checks for uncertainty estimation.\n    *   Highlights the utility of cross-language and cross-model inconsistencies as robust indicators for hallucination detection.\n    *   Provides a framework for more efficient RAG systems by reducing unnecessary retrievals, which can lead to cost savings and faster response times in real-world applications \\cite{ding20244yr}.\n    *   Encourages further research into dynamic, context-aware strategies for integrating parametric and external knowledge in LLMs.",

        "abstract": "Hallucination is a common problem for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with long generations which is difficult to eradicate. The generation with hallucinations is partially inconsistent with the image content. To mitigate hallucination, current studies either focus on the process of model inference or the results of model generation, but the solutions they design sometimes do not deal appropriately with various types of queries and the hallucinations of the generations about these queries. To accurately deal with various hallucinations, we present a unified framework, Dentist, for hallucination mitigation. The core step is to first classify the queries, then perform different processes of hallucination mitigation based on the classification result, just like a dentist first observes the teeth and then makes a plan. In a simple deployment, Dentist can classify queries as perception or reasoning and easily mitigate potential hallucinations in answers which has been demonstrated in our experiments. On MMbench, we achieve a 13.44%/10.2%/15.8% improvement in accuracy on Image Quality, a Coarse Perception visual question answering (VQA) task, over the baseline InstructBLIP/LLaVA/VisualGLM.",

This includes both \"perception hallucination\" (incorrectly describing visual attributes) and \"reasoning hallucination\" (producing fallacies in logical reasoning based on the image).\n    *   **Importance & Challenge**: Hallucinations lead to misinformation, degrade user experience, and undermine the reliability of LVLMs. Existing mitigation methods often employ a fixed verification approach, which is ineffective or inappropriate for the diverse types of hallucinations arising from different query types (e.g., object detection is not suitable for reasoning queries). Furthermore, current methods may not fully eradicate hallucinations in a single pass, sometimes leading to inconsistent corrections \\cite{chang2024u3t}.\n\n*   **2. Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Previous work on hallucination mitigation generally falls into two categories: optimizing model training/inference (e.g., RLHF-V, VIGC) or correcting hallucinations during the generation stage without model updates (e.g., Woodpecker, HalluciDoctor) \\cite{chang2024u3t}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Existing methods overlook the diversity of hallucinations. They apply a \"one-size-fits-all\" verification strategy, which is suboptimal for different query types (perception vs. reasoning). For instance, methods relying on object detection are effective for perceptual errors but fail for complex reasoning errors. This fixed approach can lead to partial or inconsistent corrections \\cite{chang2024u3t}.\n\n*   **3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes \"Dentist,\" a unified hallucination mitigation framework for LVLMs. Its core idea is to first classify the query type and then apply a tailored mitigation strategy within a validation loop \\cite{chang2024u3t}.\n        *   **Potential Hallucination Classification**: Queries are classified into \"perception\" or \"reasoning\" using ChatGPT with a specific prompt. This classification determines the type of potential hallucination in the LVLM's answer.\n        *   **Divide-and-Conquer Treatment**:\n            *   **Visual Verification for Perception Queries**: For perception-based queries, the original LVLM's long descriptive answer is broken down into sub-questions by ChatGPT. These sub-questions are then answered by the *original* LVLM (to demonstrate mitigation ability, not just a better VQA model), and the sub-answers are aggregated by ChatGPT to refine the original hallucinated response.\n            *   **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for Reasoning Queries**: For reasoning-based queries, a \"Let’s think step by step\" CoT prompt is added to the original query for the LVLM. ChatGPT then uses the LVLM's CoT-enhanced generation to correct the original answer, providing more detailed logical reasoning.\n        *   **Validation Loop**: The entire verification process is embedded in a loop. The revised answer from one iteration becomes the input for the next. The loop continues until the answer no longer changes significantly semantically (determined by ChatGPT) or a maximum iteration limit is reached, preventing \"snowball errors\" \\cite{chang2024u3t}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**: The novelty lies in being the first to:\n        *   Distinguish and apply different hallucination mitigation treatments based on the classification of potential hallucinations (perception vs. reasoning).\n        *   Employ a validation loop that iteratively refines answers until semantic convergence, ensuring more complete hallucination removal \\cite{chang2024u3t}.\n        *   The framework is designed for easy integration into various LVLMs and allows for future extensions with new classifications and treatments.\n\n*   **4. Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Framework**: Introduction of \"Dentist,\" a unified framework for hallucination classification and mitigation in LVLMs \\cite{chang2024u3t}.\n    *   **Adaptive Mitigation Strategy**: A novel approach that classifies queries (and thus potential hallucinations) into perception or reasoning types and applies tailored mitigation techniques (visual verification with sub-questions for perception, Chain-of-Thought for reasoning).\n    *   **Iterative Refinement**: Implementation of a validation loop that continuously verifies and corrects answers until semantic stability, addressing the issue of incomplete hallucination removal \\cite{chang2024u3t}.\n    *   **System Design**: A modular and easily integrable framework design that can be deployed with various LVLMs and extended with new components.\n\n*   **5. Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Comprehensive quantitative experiments were performed on several hallucination mitigation benchmarks \\cite{chang2024u3t}.\n    *   **Benchmarks**: MMBench (covering Perception and Reasoning abilities), LLaVA-QA90, CHAIR, and POPE.\n    *   **Models Evaluated**: InstructBLIP, LLaVA, and VisualGLM were used as baseline LVLMs.\n    *   **Comparison**: The method was compared against a current effective LVLM hallucination mitigation method, Woodpecker \\cite{chang2024u3t}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Results**:\n        *   Significant improvements were observed across various visual language tasks.\n        *   On the Image Quality task (a Coarse Perception VQA task) within MMBench, \"Dentist\" achieved a 13.44% improvement over InstructBLIP, 10.2% over LLaVA, and 15.8% over VisualGLM in accuracy \\cite{chang2024u3t}.\n        *   The experiments demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in mitigating hallucinations and boosting the performance of baseline LVLMs.\n\n*   **6. Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The framework relies on an external LLM (ChatGPT) for query classification, sub-question generation, answer aggregation, CoT-based correction, and semantic convergence detection. This introduces dependency on the performance and availability of such models. The paper also notes that if the validation loop reaches its maximum iteration limit without semantic convergence, it might indicate a \"snowball error\" phenomenon, in which case only the first verification's answer is returned, implying that not all hallucinations might be fully resolved in such edge cases \\cite{chang2024u3t}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The framework is designed for mitigating perception and reasoning hallucinations in LVLMs. While it is unified for these two types, its direct applicability to other potential hallucination categories (if any exist beyond these two broad types) is not explicitly discussed.\n\n*   **7. Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: \"Dentist\" advances the technical state-of-the-art by introducing a novel, adaptive, and iterative approach to hallucination mitigation, moving beyond fixed verification methods. By classifying query types and tailoring mitigation strategies, it addresses the inherent diversity of hallucinations more effectively than prior work \\cite{chang2024u3t}. The validation loop ensures a more thorough and robust correction process.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: This work provides a strong foundation for future research in several areas:\n        *   Developing more sophisticated query classification mechanisms.\n        *   Exploring additional specialized mitigation strategies for finer-grained hallucination types.\n        *   Investigating alternative methods for semantic convergence detection in iterative correction loops.\n        *   Improving the robustness of LVLMs by integrating such adaptive post-hoc correction frameworks, leading to more reliable and trustworthy multimodal AI systems \\cite{chang2024u3t}.",

        "abstract": "Though advanced in understanding visual information with human languages, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) still suffer from multimodal hallucinations. A natural concern is that during multimodal interaction, the generated hallucinations could influence the LVLMs' subsequent generation. Thus, we raise a question: When presented with a query relevant to the previously generated hallucination, will LVLMs be misled and respond incorrectly, even though the ground visual information exists? To answer this, we propose a framework called MMHalSnowball to evaluate LVLMs' behaviors when encountering generated hallucinations, where LVLMs are required to answer specific visual questions within a curated hallucinatory conversation. Crucially, our experiment shows that the performance of open-source LVLMs drops by at least $31\\%$, indicating that LVLMs are prone to accept the generated hallucinations and make false claims that they would not have supported without distractions. We term this phenomenon Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing. To mitigate this, we further propose a training-free method called Residual Visual Decoding, where we revise the output distribution of LVLMs with the one derived from the residual visual input, providing models with direct access to the visual information. Experiments show that our method can mitigate more than $24\\%$ of the snowballed multimodal hallucination while maintaining capabilities.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are susceptible to multimodal hallucinations, where their generated responses contradict visual information \\cite{zhong2024mfi}.\n    *   A critical, yet underexplored, problem is whether these generated hallucinations can \"snowball,\" influencing an LVLM's subsequent generations and leading to further incorrect responses, even when ground visual information is available. This phenomenon, termed \"Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing,\" is important because it undermines the reliability of LVLMs in interactive, conversational settings.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   Previous research has identified similar \"snowballing\" effects in Large Language Models (LLMs), where models over-commit to early mistakes, leading to accumulated errors in conversational contexts \\cite{zhong2024mfi}.\n    *   However, this paper highlights that the extent to which *multimodal* hallucinations accumulate and mislead LVLMs into generating false claims had not been systematically investigated prior to this work \\cite{zhong2024mfi}. This work positions itself as the first to conduct such an investigation.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **MMHalSnowball Framework**: \\cite{zhong2024mfi} proposes a novel framework to systematically evaluate multimodal hallucination snowballing. It constructs curated hallucinatory visual conversations where LVLMs are first prompted to describe an image, and if a hallucination is observed, a subsequent question relevant to that hallucination is posed. The framework compares LVLM performance in these hallucinatory conversations against hallucination-free contexts.\n    *   **Hallucination Creation**: The framework meticulously creates hallucinations by categorizing them into Existence, Attribute, Relation, and Imagination types. It uses ChatGPT to rewrite facts and generate image descriptions that semantically entail a specific hallucination, ensuring the hallucinated information directly contradicts the visual ground truth and invalidates the correct answer to a target question.\n    *   **Residual Visual Decoding (RVD)**: To mitigate snowballing, \\cite{zhong2024mfi} introduces a training-free decoding method. RVD works by \"residual connecting\" the visual information with the current user instruction. This process derives output distributions that emphasize direct visual evidence, which are then used to revise the LVLM's original output distribution, providing models with more direct access to visual information during generation.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Identification and Characterization of Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing**: The paper formally identifies and defines this novel phenomenon, demonstrating how LVLMs can be misled by their own previously generated hallucinations \\cite{zhong2024mfi}.\n    *   **MMHalSnowball Evaluation Framework**: A systematic framework for constructing hallucinatory visual conversations and evaluating LVLMs' susceptibility to snowballing, including a detailed methodology for hallucination creation and allocation across different types \\cite{zhong2024mfi}.\n    *   **Residual Visual Decoding (RVD)**: A novel, training-free decoding method designed to mitigate multimodal hallucination snowballing by integrating residual visual input to revise output distributions \\cite{zhong2024mfi}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Models Tested**: Experiments were conducted on prominent open-source LVLMs, including GPT-4V, LLaVA 1.5, and mPLUG-Owl2 \\cite{zhong2024mfi}.\n    *   **Dataset**: The validation set of the GQA dataset, augmented with regional descriptions from Visual Genome, was used as the data source to ensure objective perceptional questions and minimize dataset contamination \\cite{zhong2024mfi}.\n    *   **Key Findings on Snowballing**: The experiments revealed that the performance of open-source LVLMs dropped by at least 31% when exposed to hallucinatory conversational contexts compared to hallucination-free conversations. Specifically, over 59% of answers were semantically aligned with previously generated hallucinations, indicating models were misled \\cite{zhong2024mfi}.\n    *   **RVD Performance**: Residual Visual Decoding demonstrated significant mitigation, reducing snowballed multimodal hallucinations by more than 24% while successfully maintaining the models' contextual modeling capabilities \\cite{zhong2024mfi}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   The study primarily focuses on specific types of hallucinations (Existence, Attribute, Relation, Imagination) and their impact in a question-answering conversational setting \\cite{zhong2024mfi}.\n    *   While the MMHalSnowball framework is systematic, the hallucination creation process relies on ChatGPT, which introduces a dependency on another LLM's capabilities \\cite{zhong2024mfi}.\n    *   The RVD method is training-free, which is an advantage, but its generalizability across all possible LVLM architectures and tasks beyond conversational QA needs further exploration.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   This paper significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by being the first to systematically investigate and quantify the \"Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing\" phenomenon in LVLMs \\cite{zhong2024mfi}.\n    *   The proposed MMHalSnowball framework provides a robust methodology for future research to evaluate LVLM robustness against self-generated errors.\n    *   The introduction of Residual Visual Decoding offers a practical, training-free mitigation strategy, paving the way for more reliable and trustworthy LVLM interactions, particularly in safety-critical applications \\cite{zhong2024mfi}. This work highlights the need for LVLMs to maintain direct access to visual information to prevent over-reliance on potentially hallucinated textual context.",

        "title": "A Comprehensive Survey of Hallucination Mitigation Techniques in Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance in their ability to write human-like text, a key challenge remains around their tendency to hallucinate generating content that appears factual but is ungrounded. This issue of hallucination is arguably the biggest hindrance to safely deploying these powerful LLMs into real-world production systems that impact people's lives. The journey toward widespread adoption of LLMs in practical settings heavily relies on addressing and mitigating hallucinations. Unlike traditional AI systems focused on limited tasks, LLMs have been exposed to vast amounts of online text data during training. While this allows them to display impressive language fluency, it also means they are capable of extrapolating information from the biases in training data, misinterpreting ambiguous prompts, or modifying the information to align superficially with the input. This becomes hugely alarming when we rely on language generation capabilities for sensitive applications, such as summarizing medical records, financial analysis reports, etc. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of over 32 techniques developed to mitigate hallucination in LLMs. Notable among these are Retrieval Augmented Generation (Lewis et al, 2021), Knowledge Retrieval (Varshney et al,2023), CoNLI (Lei et al, 2023), and CoVe (Dhuliawala et al, 2023). Furthermore, we introduce a detailed taxonomy categorizing these methods based on various parameters, such as dataset utilization, common tasks, feedback mechanisms, and retriever types. This classification helps distinguish the diverse approaches specifically designed to tackle hallucination issues in LLMs. Additionally, we analyze the challenges and limitations inherent in these techniques, providing a solid foundation for future research in addressing hallucinations and related phenomena within the realm of LLMs.",

        "abstract": "Recent works integrating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have shown promising improvements in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on closed-ended tasks, leaving a gap in evaluating performance on more complex, real-world scenarios. This limitation also hinders a thorough assessment of KGs' potential to reduce hallucinations in LLMs. To address this, we introduce OKGQA, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs augmented with KGs in open-ended, real-world question answering settings. OKGQA reflects practical complexities through diverse question types and incorporates metrics to quantify both hallucination rates and reasoning improvements in LLM+KG models. To consider the scenarios in which KGs may contain varying levels of errors, we propose a benchmark variant, OKGQA-P, to assess model performance when the semantics and structure of KGs are deliberately perturbed and contaminated. In this paper, we aims to (1) explore whether KGs can make LLMs more trustworthy in an open-ended setting, and (2) conduct a comparative analysis to shed light on method design. We believe this study can facilitate a more complete performance comparison and encourages continuous improvement in integrating KGs with LLMs to mitigate hallucination, and make LLMs more trustworthy.

An Empirical Study Over Open-ended Question Answering \\cite{sui20242u1}\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating \"hallucinations\" (plausible but incorrect or irrelevant outputs), especially in complex, real-world scenarios. Existing benchmarks for evaluating LLM+Knowledge Graph (KG) integration primarily focus on closed-ended tasks, which are insufficient for thoroughly assessing hallucination reduction and nuanced reasoning in open-ended settings.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge:** Hallucinations pose significant risks in high-stakes domains (e.g., healthcare, scientific research). KGs offer structured, explicit, and traceable factual information, making them a promising avenue for improving LLM reliability. However, evaluating their effectiveness in complex, open-ended question answering (QA) and under realistic conditions (where KGs might contain errors) is challenging due to the lack of appropriate benchmarks and metrics.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** The work builds on the growing field of augmenting LLMs with external KGs to enhance reasoning and reduce factual errors. It also relates to Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigms.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n        *   Existing LLM+KG benchmarks predominantly focus on closed-ended tasks (e.g., fixed sets of entities, relations, or logical forms).\n        *   These closed-ended benchmarks are limited in their ability to detect and quantify hallucinations, as conventional metrics (like accuracy) cannot distinguish between errors from incorrect retrieval and fabricated answers.\n        *   They fall short in evaluating performance for complex, real-world applications that demand nuanced, paragraph-long answers.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper introduces **OKGQA**, a novel benchmark specifically designed for evaluating LLMs augmented with KGs in open-ended, real-world question answering settings.

        "title": "Logical Consistency of Large Language Models in Fact-checking",
        "abstract": "In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success in performing varied natural language tasks such as language translation, question-answering, summarizing, fact-checking, etc. Despite LLMs' impressive ability to generate human-like texts, LLMs are infamous for their inconsistent responses - a meaning-preserving change in the input query results in an inconsistent response and attributes to vulnerabilities of LLMs such as hallucination. Consequently, existing research focuses on simple paraphrasing-based consistency assessment of LLMs, and ignores complex queries that necessitate an even better understanding of logical reasoning by an LLM. Our work therefore addresses the logical inconsistency of LLMs under complex logical queries with primitive logical operators, e.g., negation, conjunction, and disjunction. As a test bed, we consider retrieval-augmented LLMs on a fact-checking task involving propositional logic queries from knowledge graphs (KGs). Our contributions are threefold. Benchmark: We introduce three logical fact-checking datasets over KGs for community development towards logically consistent LLMs. Assessment: We propose consistency measures of LLMs on propositional logic queries and demonstrate that existing LLMs lack logical consistency, especially on complex queries. Improvement: We employ supervised fine-tuning to improve the logical consistency of LLMs on the complex fact-checking task with KG contexts. We have made our source code and benchmarks available.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations, e.g., factually incorrect information, in their responses. These hallucinations present challenges for LLM-based applications that demand high factual accuracy. Existing hallucination detection methods primarily depend on external resources, which can suffer from issues such as low availability, incomplete coverage, privacy concerns, high latency, low reliability, and poor scalability. There are also methods depending on output probabilities, which are often inaccessible for closed-source LLMs like GPT models.

Research Problem & Motivation**\n*   **Specific Technical Problem:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating hallucinations, specifically factually incorrect or irrelevant information, which undermines their reliability in applications demanding high factual accuracy \\cite{yang20251dw}. The paper focuses on detecting \"fact-conflicting hallucinations\" \\cite{yang20251dw}.\n*   **Importance & Challenge:** Hallucinations, especially fact-conflicting ones, can mislead users, erode trust, and have serious consequences (e.g., in legal contexts) \\cite{yang20251dw}.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to hallucinate, whereby they generate plausible but inaccurate text. This phenomenon poses significant risks in critical applications, such as medicine or law, necessitating robust hallucination mitigation strategies. While recent works have proposed fine-tuning methods to teach LLMs to abstain from answering questions beyond their knowledge or capabilities, these methods rely on the existence of ground-truth labels or are limited to short-form responses. To address these limitations, we propose fine-tuning using semantic entropy, an uncertainty measure derived from introspection into the model which does not require external labels. We demonstrate that our approach matches or outperforms models fine-tuned using prior work and achieves strong performance for both short and long-form generations on a range of datasets.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination (generating plausible but inaccurate text), which poses significant risks in critical applications (e.g., medicine, law). While fine-tuning LLMs to abstain from answering questions beyond their knowledge is a promising mitigation strategy, existing methods suffer from two key limitations:\n        1.  They often rely on the availability of ground-truth labels, which are difficult or costly to obtain and can be noisy.\n        2.  They are typically limited to short-form responses, failing to account for the lexical and syntactical variations inherent in longer generations.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge:** Mitigating hallucinations is crucial for ensuring the safety, trustworthiness, and overall reliability of LLMs, especially as they are increasingly deployed in high-stakes real-world scenarios. Developing a label-free and versatile abstention mechanism applicable to diverse generation lengths is a significant challenge.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** This work builds upon existing hallucination mitigation strategies, particularly those involving uncertainty estimation and abstention fine-tuning. It specifically improves upon uncertainty-based fine-tuning methods like R-Tuning-U \\cite{zhang2024r} by addressing its limitations.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n        *   Many abstention fine-tuning methods (e.g., R-Tuning \\cite{zhang2024r}, \\cite{yang2023teaching}, \\cite{cheng2024uncertainty}, \\cite{wolfe2024abstain}) require ground-truth labels, making them resource-intensive and potentially susceptible to label noise.\n        *   Uncertainty-based methods like R-Tuning-U \\cite{zhang2024r} use classical entropy, which is sensitive to minor lexical and syntactical variations, thereby limiting its applicability to only short-form responses and hindering its usefulness for more complex, free-form generations.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper proposes a fine-tuning strategy that leverages *semantic entropy* to enable LLMs to appropriately abstain from answering questions when uncertain \\cite{tjandra2024umq}. This approach is label-free and robust to variations in generation length.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:**\n        *   **Semantic Entropy for Abstention:** Unlike R-Tuning-U which uses classical entropy over raw token sequences, \\cite{tjandra2024umq} computes entropy over the *semantic space* of model generations. This makes the uncertainty measure robust to lexical and syntactical variations, allowing it to accurately indicate hallucinations in both short-form and long-form generations. Semantic equivalence is operationalized using question-dependent bi-directional entailment to cluster responses.\n        *   **Label-Free Fine-Tuning:** The method constructs a training dataset by partitioning questions based on their computed semantic entropy. High-entropy questions are assigned an \"abstain\" label (\"I don't know the answer.\"), while low-entropy questions retain the model's standard response. The model is then fine-tuned using supervised learning with cross-entropy loss.\n        *   **Accuracy-Engagement Distance (AED):** A novel evaluation metric is introduced \\cite{tjandra2024umq} that holistically quantifies model hallucination by considering both accuracy and *engagement* (the number of questions a model willingly answers). AED is a normalized Euclidean distance from an ideal model (max accuracy, max engagement), penalizing models that abstain too frequently or inaccurately.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithm/Method:** A novel fine-tuning approach for LLMs that enables abstention based on *semantic entropy*, providing a label-free and robust mechanism for hallucination mitigation applicable to both short-form and long-form generations \\cite{tjandra2024umq}.\n    *   **Novel Evaluation Metric:** The introduction of the Accuracy-Engagement Distance (AED) \\cite{tjandra2024umq}, a more comprehensive metric for evaluating abstention-capable models by balancing accuracy with the willingness to answer.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** The proposed method was evaluated on LLAMA-3-8B-INSTRUCT across four datasets (TriviaQA, BioASQ, NQ, SQuAD) in a closed-book setting. Experiments covered two answering settings: Long-QA (free-form) and Short-QA (short answers). The method was compared against R-Tuning (label-dependent) and R-Tuning-U (label-independent, classical entropy) \\cite{zhang2024r}. Semantic entropy was computed using two different entailment models (DeBERTa and Llama-3-70B-Instruct).\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results:**\n        *   The method using semantic entropy (SE) matched or outperformed models fine-tuned with R-Tuning and R-Tuning-U \\cite{tjandra2024umq}.\n        *   It achieved a significant reduction in hallucination rates: up to **30.1% for long-form generations** and up to **8.7% for short-form generations** compared to R-Tuning and R-Tuning-U.\n        *   The AED metric effectively demonstrated the improved balance between accuracy and engagement of the proposed method, penalizing models with low engagement that would otherwise appear equivalent based solely on accuracy.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The effectiveness of semantic entropy relies on the quality and contextual understanding of the underlying entailment model used for semantic clustering. The uncertainty threshold (τ) for partitioning the dataset is a user-defined hyperparameter. Due to resource constraints, LoRA was used for fine-tuning, which might not capture the full potential of full fine-tuning.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The method is demonstrated for factual QA tasks in a closed-book setting. Its label-free nature makes it highly scalable and applicable to a wide range of tasks requiring uncertainty-aware abstention, for both short and long-form text generation.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** This work significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in hallucination mitigation by providing a robust, label-free, and versatile fine-tuning approach for LLM abstention \\cite{tjandra2024umq}. It successfully addresses the critical limitations of prior methods, particularly their reliance on ground-truth labels and restriction to short-form responses.\n    *   **Potential Impact:** The ability to fine-tune LLMs to abstain appropriately without external labels and across diverse generation lengths enhances their trustworthiness and safety in high-stakes applications. The proposed AED metric also offers a more comprehensive evaluation standard for future research in uncertainty-aware LLMs, fostering the development of more reliable and helpful AI systems.",

        "title": "VaLiD: Mitigating the Hallucination of Large Vision Language Models by Visual Layer Fusion Contrastive Decoding",
        "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in multimodal task reasoning. However, they often generate responses that appear plausible yet do not accurately reflect the visual content, a phenomenon known as hallucination. Recent approaches have introduced training-free methods to mitigate hallucinations by adjusting the decoding strategy during the inference stage, typically attributing hallucinations to the language model itself. Our analysis, however, reveals that distortions in the visual encoding process significantly affect the model's reasoning capabilities. Specifically, earlier visual layers may retain key features but gradually distort as the information propagates toward the output layer. Building on these insights, we propose a novel hallucination-mitigation method from the visual encoding perspective: \\textbf{V}isu\\textbf{a}l \\textbf{L}ayer Fus\\textbf{i}on Contrastive \\textbf{D}ecoding (\\textbf{VaLiD}). This method utilizes uncertainty to guide the visual layer selection, correcting distortions in the visual encoding process and thereby enhancing the reliability of the generated content. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of VaLiD in mitigating hallucinations across various benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance when compared to baseline methods. Codes are available at \\href{https://github.com/RicardoLuL/VaLiD_LVLMs_hallucinations}{Github}.",
        "summary": "Here is a focused summary of the paper for a literature review:\n\n### Focused Summary for Literature Review\n\n#### 1. Research Problem & Motivation\n*   **Specific Technical Problem**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) frequently suffer from \"hallucination,\" where they generate plausible but factually incorrect responses that do not align with the visual input \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n*   **Importance and Challenge**: Hallucinations severely undermine the reliability of LVLMs, posing significant barriers to their deployment in real-world applications \\cite{wang2024vym}. Existing inference-stage mitigation methods primarily attribute hallucinations to the language model itself. However, this paper posits that distortions in the visual encoding process are a critical, overlooked source of these errors, making the problem more complex than previously assumed \\cite{wang2024vym}. The paper identifies \"Visual Encoding Distortion,\" where key visual features captured in earlier layers become distorted as they propagate towards the final output layer, leading to incorrect inferences \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n\n#### 2. Related Work & Positioning\n*   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Previous hallucination mitigation methods generally fall into three categories:\n    *   **Post-training steps**: Involve additional training with auxiliary supervision or reinforcement learning, which are computationally expensive and require large annotated datasets \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n    *   **Post-hoc correction**: Utilize auxiliary revision models or manual pipelines during inference, often facing challenges with high computational costs, complex implementation, and limited scalability \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n    *   **Decoding strategy modification**: Intervene during the inference phase by adjusting the decoding strategy, reducing computational costs. However, these methods typically assume the language model is the primary source of hallucinations, focusing on language priors or statistical biases \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n*   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Existing inference-time decoding strategies largely overlook the impact of the visual encoding process on hallucinations \\cite{wang2024vym}. They fail to address the \"Visual Encoding Distortion\" phenomenon, where crucial visual information is corrupted before reaching the language model, leading to errors even with sophisticated decoding strategies focused solely on the language component \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n\n#### 3. Technical Approach & Innovation\n*   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes Visual-Layer Fusion Contrastive Decoding (VaLiD), a novel hallucination mitigation method that addresses distortions from the vision encoder perspective \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n    *   **Uncertainty-guided Visual-Layer Fusion**: VaLiD leverages uncertainty (measured by the entropy of the next token's probability distribution) to identify visual layers where encoding distortion occurs \\cite{wang2024vym}. Instead of relying on a single layer, it dynamically selects and fuses features from the top-k early visual layers exhibiting high uncertainty. This fusion is entropy-weighted to create a robust reference distribution \\cite{wang2024vym}. To ensure computational efficiency, visual layers are partitioned into \"buckets,\" and the optimal bucket is determined via a validation set \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n    *   **Contrastive Decoding**: VaLiD then applies a contrastive decoding approach. It contrasts the next token distribution from the standard visual output layer (Pori) with the fused reference distribution (Pref) derived from the selected early visual layers. This contrastive process generates a corrected probability distribution (Pvalid) that mitigates the adverse effects of inaccurate visual information \\cite{wang2024vym}. An adaptive reliability constraint is also incorporated to prevent penalizing valid outputs and ensure adherence to language standards \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n*   **Novelty**: VaLiD is novel because it is the first visual-centric hallucination mitigation approach that traces the origin of hallucinations to the vision encoder's internal processing \\cite{wang2024vym}. It introduces the concept of \"Visual Encoding Distortion\" and provides a mechanism (uncertainty-guided layer fusion) to identify and correct these distortions by integrating information from multiple visual layers, rather than solely relying on the final visual output or language model adjustments \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n\n#### 4. Key Technical Contributions\n*   **Novel Phenomenon Identification**: Emphasizes the critical role of the vision encoder and identifies \"Visual Encoding Distortion\" as a common phenomenon across different LVLMs, where visual information degrades as it propagates through layers \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n*   **Visual-Centric Mitigation Method**: Introduces VaLiD, the first hallucination mitigation approach that directly addresses issues within the visual encoding process, shifting the focus from solely the language model to the vision encoder \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n*   **Uncertainty-Guided Layer Fusion**: Proposes a novel mechanism for dynamically selecting and fusing visual features from early layers based on their uncertainty, providing a more robust reference for contrastive decoding \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n*   **Enhanced Contrastive Decoding**: Integrates this visual-layer fusion into a contrastive decoding framework, effectively correcting distorted visual information and improving the reliability of generated content \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n\n#### 5. Experimental Validation\n*   **Experiments Conducted**: VaLiD was integrated with three representative LVLMs: InstructBLIP-7B, LLaVA-v1.5-7B, and Qwen-VL-7B \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n*   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n    *   **Benchmarks**: Evaluated on three hallucination benchmarks: POPE (assessing object existence hallucination across MS-COCO, A-OKVQA, GQA datasets), AMBER (fine-grained evaluation of existence, attribute, and relational hallucinations), and MME (comprehensive benchmark covering 14 tasks, with focus on existence, count, location, and color subsets for hallucination assessment) \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n    *   **Metrics**: Accuracy (Acc.), F1-score, and Yes Accuracy (Yes Acc.) for POPE; Acc. and F1 for AMBER; and specific task scores for MME \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n    *   **Comparison**: Compared against baseline methods including Vanilla decoding and other contrastive decoding approaches like VCD, M3ID, and Ritual \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n    *   **Results**: VaLiD consistently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in mitigating hallucinations across various benchmarks and LVLMs. For instance, on POPE, VaLiD generally achieved higher Acc. and F1 scores across all datasets and negative sampling strategies compared to baselines \\cite{wang2024vym}. It effectively reduced object-level and attribute-level hallucinations without compromising the model's general reasoning capabilities on other MME tasks \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n\n#### 6. Limitations & Scope\n*   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The method relies on the assumption that earlier visual layers retain key features that become distorted later, and that uncertainty is a reliable indicator of this distortion \\cite{wang2024vym}. While the paper demonstrates this empirically, the theoretical underpinnings of why uncertainty correlates with distortion could be further explored.\n*   **Scope of Applicability**: VaLiD is designed for LVLMs that utilize Vision Transformers (ViT) as their visual encoder, as it operates by accessing and fusing features from different hidden layers of the ViT backbone \\cite{wang2024vym}. Its direct applicability to LVLMs with fundamentally different visual encoder architectures might require adaptation. The \"bucketing\" strategy for layer selection, while improving efficiency, implies a trade-off that needs careful validation for optimal performance \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n\n#### 7. Technical Significance\n*   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: VaLiD significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in hallucination mitigation by introducing a novel visual-centric perspective, moving beyond language-model-centric approaches \\cite{wang2024vym}. It provides a concrete method to identify and correct visual encoding distortions, a previously underexplored root cause of LVLM hallucinations \\cite{wang2024vym}.\n*   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: This work opens new avenues for research into the internal workings of vision encoders within LVLMs. It suggests that future efforts in improving LVLM reliability should not only focus on language model biases or post-hoc corrections but also on ensuring the integrity of visual information throughout the encoding process. It could inspire further investigations into dynamic layer selection, uncertainty quantification in multimodal models, and more sophisticated visual feature fusion techniques for robust multimodal reasoning \\cite{wang2024vym}.",

        "abstract": "Despite the recent breakthroughs achieved by Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) in understanding and responding to complex visual-textual contexts, their inherent hallucination tendencies limit their practical application in real-world scenarios that demand high levels of precision. Existing methods typically either fine-tune the LVLMs using additional data, which incurs extra costs in manual annotation and computational resources or perform comparisons at the decoding stage, which may eliminate useful language priors for reasoning while introducing inference time overhead. Therefore, we propose ICT, a lightweight, training-free method that calculates an intervention direction to shift the model’s focus towards different levels of visual information, enhancing its attention to high-level and fine-grained visual details. During the forward pass stage, the intervention is applied to the attention heads that encode the overall image information and the fine-grained object details, effectively mitigating the phenomenon of overly language priors, and thereby alleviating hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ICT achieves strong performance with a small amount of data and generalizes well across different datasets and models.

The problem is challenging due to:\n        *   **Overly Strong Language Priors**: Powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) within LVLMs often dominate weaker visual encoders, leading to an excessive reliance on language cues over visual input \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n        *   **Lack of Fine-Grained Visual Semantics**: Current visual decoders struggle to capture detailed visual features, resulting in errors regarding object attributes like color and quantity \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches**: Previous efforts to mitigate hallucinations generally fall into three categories:\n        *   **Fine-tuning with additional data**: Involves introducing high-quality annotated data to align model behavior with human interpretations \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n            *   *Limitations*: Requires costly manual annotation, substantial computational resources for model parameter updates, and limits scalability \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n        *   **Perceptual enhancement**: Incorporates auxiliary information (e.g., depth maps, segmentation maps) to assist visual encoders \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n            *   *Limitations*: Often requires manual selection of auxiliary features, limiting generalizability across tasks \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n        *   **Contrastive decoding (CD)**: Induces hallucinations (e.g., via blurring) and penalizes associated tokens during the decoding stage to mitigate language priors \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n            *   *Limitations*: Indiscriminately eliminates *all* language priors, including potentially beneficial ones, which can inadvertently lead to new hallucinations \\cite{chen2024j0g}. Also introduces inference time overhead \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n    *   **Positioning of this Work**: `\\cite{chen2024j0g}` proposes ICT, a novel, lightweight, training-free, and plug-and-play method that operates during the *forward pass*, unlike contrastive decoding methods. It enhances the model's focus on visual details without eliminating useful language priors and introduces no additional inference latency. It specifically targets the \"severely underexploited\" activation space during inference \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method (ICT)**: Image-Object Cross-Level Trusted Intervention \\cite{chen2024j0g} is a training-free, plug-and-play method that calculates an \"intervention direction\" to shift the model's focus towards different levels of visual information during the forward pass.\n    *   **Mechanism**: `\\cite{chen2024j0g}` identifies activation value deviations in attention heads that can shift the model from \"untrustworthy\" to \"trustworthy\" responses. It then applies targeted interventions to these heads.\n    *   **Two Levels of Intervention**:\n        *   **Image-Level Intervention**: Aims to enhance the model's focus on overall visual information to reduce over-reliance on language priors. It constructs trusted (original image) and untrusted (globally blurred image) data pairs, calculates an activation shift vector based on their differences, and trains binary classifiers (SVMs) for each attention head to identify those encoding overall image information. The shift is then applied to these selected heads \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n        *   **Object-Level Intervention**: Focuses on increasing attention to fine-grained object details to mitigate hallucinations caused by the omission of critical objects. It uses Grounding DINO to identify object regions, creates trusted (original image) and untrusted (locally blurred object region) data pairs, calculates an object-level activation shift vector, and trains binary classifiers to identify heads distinguishing these object-focused pairs. The shift is applied to these selected heads \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n    *   **Unified Approach**: Both Image-Level and Object-Level interventions are integrated by summing their respective shifts on selected attention heads, providing a balanced attention mechanism \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   **Forward Pass Intervention**: Operates during the forward pass, making it orthogonal and complementary to existing decoding strategies and introducing no additional latency \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n        *   **Targeted Head-Level Intervention**: Identifies and intervenes on specific attention heads responsible for encoding different levels of visual information (overall image vs. fine-grained objects) using binary classifiers \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n        *   **Preservation of Language Priors**: Enhances visual focus without indiscriminately eliminating beneficial language priors, a key limitation of contrastive decoding \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n        *   **Training-Free**: Does not require additional training or fine-tuning of the LVLM parameters \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   Proposes ICT \\cite{chen2024j0g}, a novel, training-free, plug-and-play method that effectively reduces hallucinations in LVLMs by enhancing focus on both overall visual information and fine-grained object details during the forward pass.\n    *   Introduces an intervention mechanism that operates during the forward pass, offering an alternative to decoding-stage methods and avoiding additional inference latency \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n    *   Develops a method to identify and target specific attention heads responsible for encoding different levels of visual information using binary classifiers and activation shift vectors derived from trusted/untrusted data pairs \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n    *   Demonstrates a balanced attention mechanism that mitigates excessive reliance on language priors while preserving useful ones \\cite{chen2024j0g}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Models Evaluated**: LLaVA-v1.5 \\cite{chen2024j0g} and Qwen-VL \\cite{chen2024j0g} were used as baseline LVLMs.\n    *   **Datasets**:\n        *   **POPE \\cite{chen2024j0g} (Polling-based Object Probing Evaluation)**: Used to assess object-level hallucinations with Yes/No questions.

Large language models (LLM) have made significant achievements in the field of natural language processing, but the generated text often contains content that is inconsistent with the real world or user input, known as hallucinations. This article investigates the current situation of hallucinations in LLM, including the definition, types, causes, and solutions of hallucinations. Illusions are divided into different types such as factual and faithful, mainly caused by factors such as training data defects, low utilization of facts, and randomness in the decoding process. The phenomenon of hallucinations poses a threat to the reliability of LLM, especially in fields such as healthcare, finance, and law, which may lead to serious consequences.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented performances in various applications, yet evaluating them is still challenging. Existing benchmarks are either manually constructed or are automatic, but lack the ability to evaluate the thought process of LLMs with arbitrary complexity. We contend that utilizing existing relational databases based on the entity-relationship (ER) model is a promising approach for constructing benchmarks as they contain structured knowledge that can be used to question LLMs. Unlike knowledge graphs, which are also used to evaluate LLMs, relational databases have integrity constraints that can be used to better construct complex in-depth questions and verify answers: (1) functional dependencies can be used to pinpoint critical keywords that an LLM must know to properly answer a given question containing certain attribute values; and (2) foreign key constraints can be used to join relations and construct multi-hop questions, which can be arbitrarily long and used to debug intermediate answers. We thus propose ERBench, which uses these integrity constraints to convert any database into an LLM benchmark. ERBench supports continuous evaluation as databases change, multimodal questions, and various prompt engineering techniques. In our experiments, we construct LLM benchmarks using databases of multiple domains and make an extensive comparison of contemporary LLMs. We show how ERBench can properly evaluate any LLM by not only checking for answer correctness, but also effectively verifying the rationales by looking for the right keywords.",

        "abstract": "Mitigating hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) remains an open problem. Recent benchmarks do not address hallucinations in open-ended free-form responses, which we term “Type I hallucinations”. Instead, they focus on hallucinations responding to very specific question formats-typically a multiple-choice response regarding a particular object or attribute-which we term “Type II hallucinations”. Additionally, such benchmarks often require external API calls to models which are subject to change. In practice, we observe that a reduction in Type II hallucinations does not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations but rather that the two forms of halluci-nations are often anti-correlated. To address this, we propose THRONE, a novel object-based automatic framework for quantitatively evaluating Type I hallucinations in LVLM free-form outputs. We use public language models (LMs) to identify hallucinations in LVLM responses and compute informative metrics. By evaluating a large selection of recent LVLMs using public datasets, we show that an improvement in existing metrics do not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations, and that established benchmarks for measuring Type I hallucinations are incomplete. Finally, we provide a simple and effective data augmentation method to reduce Type I and Type II hallucinations as a strong baseline.",

        "abstract": "Hallucination is often regarded as a major impediment for using large language models (LLMs), especially for knowledge-intensive tasks. Even when the training corpus consists solely of true statements, language models still generate hallucinations in the form of amalgamations of multiple facts. We coin this phenomenon as ``knowledge overshadowing'': when we query knowledge from a language model with multiple conditions, some conditions overshadow others, leading to hallucinated outputs. This phenomenon partially stems from training data imbalance, which we verify on both pretrained models and fine-tuned models, over a wide range of LM model families and sizes.From a theoretical point of view, knowledge overshadowing can be interpreted as over-generalization of the dominant conditions (patterns). We show that the hallucination rate grows with both the imbalance ratio (between the popular and unpopular condition) and the length of dominant condition description, consistent with our derived generalization bound. Finally, we propose to utilize overshadowing conditions as a signal to catch hallucination before it is produced, along with a training-free self-contrastive decoding method to alleviate hallucination during inference. Our proposed approach showcases up to 82% F1 for hallucination anticipation and 11.2% to 39.4% hallucination control, with different models and datasets.",
        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review, emphasizing technical innovations and empirical validation:\n\n### Focused Summary for Literature Review: Knowledge Overshadowing Causes Amalgamated Hallucination in Large Language Models \\cite{zhang2024qq9}\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses a specific type of hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) called \"amalgamated hallucination,\" which occurs even when training data is factually correct. This phenomenon is coined \"knowledge overshadowing,\" where, given multiple conditions in a query, some dominant conditions overshadow others, leading to incorrect, amalgamated outputs \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge**: Hallucination is a major impediment to LLM reliability, especially for knowledge-intensive tasks. Existing explanations often point to low-quality data or decoding issues, but this work identifies a persistent hallucination type stemming from data imbalance and over-generalization, posing a fundamental challenge to LLM factual consistency \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Previous studies attribute hallucination to low-quality training data or discrepancies between input/output in decoding \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: This work distinguishes itself by showing that amalgamated hallucinations due to knowledge overshadowing persist even with factually correct training data, indicating that these prior explanations do not fully cover the observed phenomenon \\cite{zhang2024qq9}. It positions knowledge overshadowing as a case of over-generalization, a distinct root cause.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes that knowledge overshadowing is a case of over-generalization of dominant conditions (patterns) in the training data, often stemming from data imbalance.\n    *   **Novelty**:\n        *   **Discovery of Knowledge Overshadowing**: Identifying and formally defining \"knowledge overshadowing\" as a prevalent cause of amalgamated hallucinations in LLMs \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n        *   **Theoretical Interpretation**: Interpreting this phenomenon as over-generalization and deriving a generalization bound that connects hallucination rate with imbalance ratio and condition length \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n        *   **Inference-time Mitigation**: Proposing a novel, training-free, two-step inference-time approach:\n            1.  **Detection**: Utilizing Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) to pre-identify possible overshadowed conditions in the generation prompt.\n            2.  **Alleviation**: Employing a self-contrastive decoding method over dominant conditions to reduce hallucination during inference \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Phenomenon & Analysis**: Discovery and characterization of \"knowledge overshadowing\" as a specific, prevalent type of hallucination caused by popular conditions suppressing less popular ones, leading to factually incorrect outputs \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights**: Quantification of the relationship between imbalance ratio, condition length, and hallucination rate, supported by a derived generalization bound for auto-regressive language modeling that aligns with empirical observations \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n    *   **Novel Mitigation Method**: A simple yet effective training-free self-contrastive decoding method, combined with PMI-based detection, to anticipate and alleviate knowledge overshadowing-induced hallucinations during inference \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**:\n        *   **Verification of Overshadowing**: Probing experiments on pretrained models (Olmo-7b) using natural language queries to demonstrate overshadowing across various conditions (gender, race, occupation, negation) and its correlation with training data mentions \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n        *   **Controlled Fine-tuning Experiments**: Fine-tuning various LLM families (Llama-2-7B, Mistral-7B, GPT-J-6B, Phi-2-2.8B, Pythia-410m) on natural language tasks (Event-Time, Event-Location, Gender Bias, Negation) with controlled data imbalance ratios (10:1 to 100:1) \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n        *   **Synthetic Data Experiments**: Using synthetic datasets with varying imbalance ratios and condition lengths to quantitatively analyze their impact on hallucination rates across Pythia model family sizes (160m to 2.8b) \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n        *   **Generalization Correlation**: Experiments correlating hallucination rate with Gradient Signal-to-Noise Ratio (GSNR) and varying weight decay to demonstrate that overshadowing is linked to over-generalization \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n        *   **Mitigation Method Evaluation**: Extensive experiments evaluating the proposed PMI-detection and self-contrastive decoding method on a mixture of datasets and models \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Results**:\n        *   **Hallucination Rate (HR) / Relative Hallucination Rate (rHR)**: Consistently observed high hallucination rates across all tasks and models.\n        *   **Impact of Imbalance Ratio**: Hallucination rate consistently increased with higher imbalance ratios (e.g., up to 88.3% for Mistral-7B on Negation with 100:1 ratio) \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n        *   **Impact of Model Size**: Larger models exhibited higher hallucination rates, suggesting inverse scaling for this specific hallucination type \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n        *   **Impact of Condition Length**: Longer dominant condition descriptions led to higher hallucination rates \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n        *   **Proposed Method Performance**: The proposed approach achieved up to **82% F1 for hallucination anticipation** and demonstrated **11.2% to 39.4% hallucination control** (reduction in hallucination rate) across different models and datasets \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**: The proposed mitigation method is an inference-time solution, which might not address the fundamental training-time causes of over-generalization. The detection mechanism relies on identifying \"overshadowing conditions\" which might be challenging in highly complex, open-ended prompts \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The work primarily focuses on \"amalgamated hallucinations\" caused by \"knowledge overshadowing\" due to data imbalance and over-generalization. It does not claim to address all forms of LLM hallucination \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: This paper significantly advances the understanding of LLM hallucination by identifying a novel and prevalent mechanism (\"knowledge overshadowing\") that persists even with factual training data. It provides a theoretical framework (over-generalization and generalization bound) to explain this phenomenon \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.\n    *   **Potential Impact**: The proposed training-free, inference-time detection and mitigation method offers a practical and immediate solution for improving the factual consistency of LLMs in knowledge-intensive applications. This work opens new avenues for research into data-centric approaches and decoding strategies to combat specific types of hallucinations \\cite{zhang2024qq9}.",

[trivedi2022qsf]'s IRCoT interleaves CoT with retrieval to dynamically fetch relevant facts *before* generating the next reasoning step, aiming to prevent hallucination by grounding. [kang202378c]'s EVER, however, generates a sentence, then *validates* it at a concept level, and *rectifies* it if found to be hallucinatory, actively correcting errors as they emerge.\n    *   **Problems Addressed:** [trivedi2022qsf] addresses the problem of LLMs struggling with knowledge-intensive multi-step QA due to outdated or unavailable internal knowledge, leading to hallucinations. It tackles the insufficiency of one-shot retrieval. [kang202378c] specifically targets the \"snowballing\" issue of hallucinations, where initial factual errors propagate and accumulate in long-form generation, a problem not fully addressed by pre-generation or post-hoc methods.\n    *   **Innovations/Capabilities:** [trivedi2022qsf] introduces dynamic, bidirectional interleaving of CoT reasoning and retrieval, using intermediate CoT steps as queries. [kang202378c] innovates with a three-stage, real-time (per-sentence) verification and rectification process, concept-level validation, and tailored strategies for intrinsic vs. extrinsic hallucinations. It also shows how EVER-rectified data can be used for preference tuning to enhance factuality.\n    *   **Temporal Context:** These papers are published within a year of each other (2022 vs. 2023), reflecting the rapid emergence and recognition of LLM hallucination as a critical problem and the swift development of increasingly sophisticated, real-time mitigation strategies.\n\n2.  **[kang202378c] Ever: Mitigating Hallucination in Large Language Models through Real-Time Verification and Rectification (2023) to [gao20232zb] Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models: A Survey (2023)**\n    *   **Methodological/Conceptual Shift:** The shift is from proposing a *specific algorithmic solution* for real-time hallucination mitigation ([kang202378c]) to providing a *comprehensive survey and categorization* of a broader class of solutions, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which inherently aims to reduce hallucination among other LLM limitations ([gao20232zb]). This marks a move from individual innovation to systematic field organization.\n    *   **Problems Addressed:** [kang202378c] solves the \"snowballing\" hallucination problem. [gao20232zb] addresses the need for a structured understanding of RAG's evolution and its role in mitigating LLM issues like hallucination, outdated knowledge, and lack of transparency, which are inherent to native LLMs. It also highlights the limitations of \"Naive RAG\" and fine-tuning.\n    *   **Innovations/Capabilities:** [kang202378c] introduces the EVER framework. [gao20232zb], as a survey, innovates by providing the first systematic categorization of RAG into Naive, Advanced, and Modular paradigms, detailing their components (e.g., query optimization, re-ranking, iterative retrieval flows like FLARE and Self-RAG). It offers a roadmap for RAG development.\n    *   **Temporal Context:** Both papers are from 2023, indicating that as specific solutions like EVER emerged, there was a concurrent need to consolidate and understand the broader landscape of related techniques like RAG.\n\n3.  **[gao20232zb] Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models: A Survey (2023) to [huang2023akj] A Survey on Hallucination in Large Language Models: Principles, Taxonomy, Challenges, and Open Questions (2023)**\n    *   **Methodological/Conceptual Shift:** Both are survey papers, but the conceptual focus shifts from *surveying a solution category (RAG)* that *helps* with hallucination ([gao20232zb]) to *directly surveying the problem of hallucination itself* ([huang2023akj]). This involves defining, categorizing, analyzing causes, and outlining general detection and mitigation strategies, with RAG being one of many.\n    *   **Problems Addressed:** [gao20232zb] addresses the lack of a structured overview of RAG. [huang2023akj] tackles the fundamental problem of LLM hallucination, its pervasive nature, and the difficulty in detecting it. It highlights the need for a clear, comprehensive understanding of hallucination beyond just factual errors, introducing \"faithfulness hallucinations.\"\n    *   **Innovations/Capabilities:** [gao20232zb] provides a RAG taxonomy. [huang2023akj] offers a novel, layered taxonomy of LLM hallucination (factuality vs. faithfulness), a comprehensive categorization of causes (data, training, inference), and a structured framework linking mitigation strategies directly to these causes. It also provides an in-depth analysis of RAG's limitations in combating hallucination.\n    *   **Temporal Context:** Both from 2023. This close timing suggests a rapid maturation of the field, moving from understanding solutions to deeply understanding the problem itself, requiring formal definitions and taxonomies.\n\n4.  **[huang2023akj] A Survey on Hallucination in Large Language Models: Principles, Taxonomy, Challenges, and Open Questions (2023) to [ye2023yom] Cognitive Mirage: A Review of Hallucinations in Large Language Models (2023)**\n    *   **Methodological/Conceptual Shift:** Both are comprehensive surveys on hallucination in LLMs. [huang2023akj] provides a conceptual framework with a novel taxonomy and cause-aligned mitigation. [ye2023yom] builds upon this by offering an *even deeper, more mechanistic analysis* of hallucination origins (data collection, knowledge gaps, optimization process, including \"snowballing\") and a *task-specific taxonomy*. It moves from a general conceptual understanding to a more granular, mechanistic, and application-oriented view.\n    *   **Problems Addressed:** [huang2023akj] addresses the need for a unified understanding of LLM hallucination. [ye2023yom] further addresses the need for a systematic understanding of the *mechanisms* behind hallucinations, providing a detailed breakdown of how they arise from various stages of LLM development and deployment. It also aims to consolidate scattered benchmarks and methods.\n    *   **Innovations/Capabilities:** [huang2023akj] introduces the factuality vs. faithfulness taxonomy and cause-aligned mitigation. [ye2023yom] innovates with a novel taxonomy categorized by various text generation tasks, a detailed theoretical analysis of hallucination origins (memory distortion, knowledge representation limits, data timeliness, optimization issues like stochastic parroting and exposure bias), and a comprehensive review of detection and correction methods.\n    *   **Temporal Context:** Both are from 2023, indicating parallel or quickly successive efforts to comprehensively map and understand the multifaceted problem of LLM hallucination from slightly different angles, reinforcing the urgency and complexity of the issue.\n\n---\n\n*Evolution Analysis (Narrative):*\n\nThe evolution of research into \"Hallucination in Large Language Models\" through these five papers reveals two major, intertwined trends: first, a progression from *static knowledge integration to dynamic, real-time factual correction*, and second, a deepening shift from *ad-hoc problem-solving to comprehensive conceptualization and systematic categorization* of hallucination itself.\n\n**Trend 1: From Static Knowledge Integration to Dynamic, Real-time Factual Correction**\n\n*   *Methodological progression*: Initially, LLMs struggled with knowledge-intensive tasks due to their parametric knowledge limitations, leading to hallucinations. [trivedi2022qsf] \"Interleaving Retrieval with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Knowledge-Intensive Multi-Step Questions\" (2022) marked a significant step by introducing IRCoT, a method that dynamically *interleaves* Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with external knowledge retrieval. This moved beyond static, one-shot retrieval by using intermediate CoT steps to generate more precise queries, grounding subsequent reasoning. Building on this, [kang202378c] \"Ever: Mitigating Hallucination in Large Language Models through Real-Time Verification and Rectification\" (2023) pushed the boundary further by introducing EVER, a real-time, step-wise framework that not only generates but also *validates* and *rectifies* content at a concept level *during* generation. This represents a shift from pre-emptive grounding to active, granular self-correction. The broader context of these methods is captured by [gao20232zb] \"Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models: A Survey\" (2023), which systematically categorizes RAG's evolution from \"Naive\" to \"Advanced\" and \"Modular\" paradigms, highlighting how techniques like iterative and adaptive retrieval (e.g., FLARE, Self-RAG) have become central to dynamically integrating knowledge and mitigating hallucination.\n\n*   *Problem evolution*: [trivedi2022qsf] addressed the problem of LLMs hallucinating in multi-step QA when their internal knowledge was insufficient or outdated. It highlighted the inadequacy of simple retrieve-and-read approaches for complex reasoning. [kang202378c] then tackled a more insidious problem: the \"snowballing\" effect, where initial factual errors propagate and accumulate in long-form generation, making post-hoc correction increasingly difficult. This recognized that even with retrieval, errors could still occur and compound. [gao20232zb]'s survey contextualized these challenges by outlining how RAG, in its various forms, aims to overcome LLM limitations such as hallucination, reliance on outdated knowledge, and lack of transparency, thereby providing a robust mechanism for dynamic knowledge access.\n\n*   *Key innovations*: [trivedi2022qsf]'s key innovation was the dynamic, bidirectional interleaving of CoT and retrieval, enabling adaptive information seeking. [kang202378c] introduced the novel concept of real-time, concept-level verification and rectification during generation, effectively preventing error propagation and even leveraging rectified data for preference tuning. [gao20232zb], as a survey, innovated by providing a structured understanding of RAG's architectural evolution, from simple retrieve-read to modular systems with sophisticated pre- and post-retrieval optimizations and flexible interaction patterns.\n\n**Trend 2: Deepening the Understanding and Taxonomy of LLM Hallucinations**\n\n*   *Methodological progression*: As solutions like RAG and real-time correction emerged, the field concurrently recognized the need for a deeper, more systematic understanding of hallucination itself. [gao20232zb] \"Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models: A Survey\" (2023) provided a foundational overview of RAG as a solution, implicitly categorizing how different RAG techniques address hallucination. This paved the way for dedicated surveys like [huang2023akj] \"A Survey on Hallucination in Large Language Models: Principles, Taxonomy, Challenges, and Open Questions\" (2023) and [ye2023yom] \"Cognitive Mirage: A Review of Hallucinations in Large Language Models\" (2023). These papers shifted the methodological focus from *solving* hallucination to *defining, categorizing, and analyzing its root causes*. [huang2023akj] proposed a novel taxonomy (factuality vs. faithfulness) and linked mitigation strategies directly to identified causes (data, training, inference). [ye2023yom] further deepened this by offering a mechanistic analysis of hallucination origins (data collection, knowledge gaps, optimization processes like \"snowballing\") and a task-specific taxonomy, providing a more granular theoretical understanding.\n\n*   *Problem evolution*: While earlier papers focused on mitigating specific instances of hallucination, the later surveys addressed the overarching problem of its pervasive nature and the lack of a unified conceptual framework. [gao20232zb] highlighted RAG's role in addressing general LLM limitations. [huang2023akj] identified the critical need to distinguish between different types of hallucination (e.g., factual errors vs. unfaithfulness to context/instructions) and to understand their diverse origins. [ye2023yom] further emphasized the challenge of memory distortion, knowledge representation limits, and the \"snowballing\" effect as fundamental mechanistic problems that contribute to hallucinations across various LLM applications.\n\n*   *Key innovations*: [gao20232zb]'s innovation was the comprehensive categorization of RAG paradigms. [huang2023akj] innovated with its layered taxonomy of hallucination and a structured framework that directly correlated mitigation strategies with their root causes, offering a clear roadmap for researchers. [ye2023yom] provided a novel, task-oriented taxonomy and a profound theoretical analysis of the underlying mechanisms of hallucination, consolidating fragmented research into a coherent framework and identifying concrete future research directions.\n\n---\n\n*Synthesis:*\n\nThis chain of research illustrates a rapid and sophisticated intellectual trajectory, moving from developing practical, dynamic solutions for grounding LLM reasoning and correcting factual errors in real-time to a comprehensive, theoretical understanding of hallucination itself. Collectively, these works significantly advance the field by providing both effective mitigation strategies and a robust conceptual framework for defining, categorizing, and diagnosing the multifaceted problem of hallucination in Large Language Models."
