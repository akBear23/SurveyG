Building on the need for robust detection, `\\cite{manakul20236ex}` introduced `SelfCheckGPT`, a novel zero-resource, black-box method that leverages the consistency of stochastically sampled LLM outputs to identify non-factual statements. Most profoundly, `\\cite{xu2024n76}` shifts the paradigm by providing a theoretical proof, using a diagonalization argument, that hallucination is an inherent and inevitable limitation for all computable LLMs, regardless of their architecture or training. While `\\cite{maynez2020h3q}` and `\\cite{manakul20236ex}` offer practical tools and insights for measurement and detection, `\\cite{xu2024n76}` sets a fundamental theoretical ceiling on the problem, suggesting that complete elimination is impossible and guiding future research towards mitigation and robust deployment rather than eradication.\n\n    *   *Subgroup name*: Retrieval-Augmented and Reasoning-Enhanced Mitigation for Text-based LLMs\n    *   *Papers*:\n        *   [yao20229uz] ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models (2022)\n        *   [trivedi2022qsf] Interleaving Retrieval with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Knowledge-Intensive Multi-Step Questions (2022)\n        *   [gao2023ht7] Enabling Large Language Models to Generate Text with Citations (2023)\n        *   [chen2023h04] Benchmarking Large Language Models in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (2023)\n    *   *Analysis*: This cluster explores practical strategies to mitigate hallucination in text-based LLMs, primarily through dynamic external knowledge integration and enhanced reasoning. `\\cite{yao20229uz}` introduced `ReAct`, a seminal paradigm that interleaves verbal reasoning (\"thoughts\") with task-specific actions (e.g., API calls) to ground LLM responses and reduce hallucination by interacting with external environments. `\\cite{trivedi2022qsf}` further refined this by proposing `IRCoT`, which dynamically uses intermediate Chain-of-Thought steps as queries for iterative knowledge retrieval, significantly reducing factual errors in multi-step QA. Complementing these mitigation techniques, `\\cite{gao2023ht7}` developed `ALCE`, a benchmark and evaluation framework for enabling LLMs to generate text with verifiable citations, directly addressing trustworthiness and verifiability. Finally, `\\cite{chen2023h04}` critically evaluates the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by introducing the `RGB` benchmark, diagnosing specific RAG capabilities like noise robustness and negative rejection, revealing that despite its promise, RAG still faces significant challenges in preventing LLM hallucination. These papers collectively demonstrate a strong focus on grounding LLMs in external, verifiable information and structured reasoning, while also rigorously evaluating the limitations of these approaches.\n\n    *   *Subgroup name*: Hallucination in Multi-Modal Models: Characterization, Mitigation, and Evaluation\n    *   *Papers*:\n        *   [li2023249] Evaluating Object Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (2023)\n        *   [liu2023882] Mitigating Hallucination in Large Multi-Modal Models via Robust Instruction Tuning (2023)\n    *   *Analysis*: This subgroup specifically addresses the unique challenges of hallucination in multi-modal models, where inconsistencies arise between generated text and visual input. `\\cite{li2023249}` conducted the first systematic empirical study of \"object hallucination\" in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), proposing `POPE` as a more stable and flexible evaluation method than existing metrics like CHAIR, and crucially identifying object frequency and co-occurrence in training data as key drivers of hallucination. Building on the need for robust LMMs, `\\cite{liu2023882}` introduced `LRV-Instruction`, a novel dataset incorporating diverse *negative instructions* (e.g., describing nonexistent objects) to explicitly train LMMs to avoid hallucination. They also proposed `GAVIE`, a GPT4-assisted evaluation framework for assessing both instruction-following and visual hallucination. Both papers highlight the critical importance of tailored evaluation methods for multi-modal hallucination, with `\\cite{li2023249}` characterizing the problem and its causes, and `\\cite{liu2023882}` offering a data-centric mitigation strategy through robust instruction tuning, demonstrating the effectiveness of training with explicit negative examples.\n\n3.  *Overall Perspective*:\n    The intellectual trajectory of research into LLM hallucination has evolved from initial characterization and empirical detection to sophisticated mitigation strategies and, more recently, a theoretical understanding of its fundamental limits. The first subgroup established what hallucination is and how to measure it, culminating in the profound theoretical insight from `\\cite{xu2024n76}` that it is an inherent property. This theoretical grounding informs the practical efforts in the second subgroup, which focuses on external grounding via retrieval and reasoning (`\\cite{yao20229uz}`, `\\cite{trivedi2022qsf}`) and verifiable generation (`\\cite{gao2023ht7}`), while `\\cite{chen2023h04}` critically evaluates the limitations of these very mitigation strategies. The third subgroup addresses the distinct challenges of multi-modal hallucination, demonstrating that while the core problem persists, tailored evaluation (`\\cite{li2023249}`) and training (`\\cite{liu2023882}`) approaches are necessary. The field is transitioning from a purely engineering-driven problem-solving approach to one that acknowledges fundamental limitations, necessitating robust detection, effective mitigation, and a clear understanding of where current methods fall short, especially as models become increasingly multi-modal.",
