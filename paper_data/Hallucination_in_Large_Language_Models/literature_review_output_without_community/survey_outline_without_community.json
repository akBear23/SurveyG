        "subsection_focus": "Examines advanced methods for detecting hallucinations that operate without reliance on external knowledge bases, internal model access, or extensive human labels. This subsection discusses techniques like SelfCheckGPT, which leverages consistency checks across multiple model generations, and MetaQA, which employs metamorphic relations and prompt mutation to expose factual inconsistencies. These 'zero-resource' and 'black-box' approaches are particularly valuable for evaluating proprietary LLMs where internal states are inaccessible, offering scalable and model-agnostic solutions for identifying hallucinated content and enhancing the practical applicability of detection frameworks.",

This subsection discusses novel techniques, such as exploiting the 'attention sink' phenomenon, to intentionally induce hallucinations in multimodal models. By dynamically manipulating internal attention scores and hidden embeddings, researchers can uncover specific weaknesses and failure modes that might not be apparent through passive observation. This methodology moves beyond merely reacting to observed hallucinations to actively testing and strengthening model robustness, guiding the development of more resilient and secure AI systems against sophisticated attacks.",
