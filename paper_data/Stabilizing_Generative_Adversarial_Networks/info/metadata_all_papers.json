The key idea is to grow both the generator and discriminator progressively: starting from a low resolution, we add new layers that model increasingly fine details as training progresses. This both speeds the training up and greatly stabilizes it, allowing us to produce images of unprecedented quality, e.g., CelebA images at 1024^2. We also propose a simple way to increase the variation in generated images, and achieve a record inception score of 8.80 in unsupervised CIFAR10. Additionally, we describe several implementation details that are important for discouraging unhealthy competition between the generator and discriminator. Finally, we suggest a new metric for evaluating GAN results, both in terms of image quality and variation. As an additional contribution, we construct a higher-quality version of the CelebA dataset.",

We demonstrate, on several datasets, that good results are now possible using only a few thousand training images, often matching StyleGAN2 results with an order of magnitude fewer images.

We decompose the hard problem into more manageable sub-problems through a sketch-refinement process. The Stage-I GAN sketches the primitive shape and colors of the object based on the given text description, yielding Stage-I low-resolution images. The Stage-II GAN takes Stage-I results and text descriptions as inputs, and generates high-resolution images with photo-realistic details. It is able to rectify defects in Stage-I results and add compelling details with the refinement process. To improve the diversity of the synthesized images and stabilize the training of the conditional-GAN, we introduce a novel Conditioning Augmentation technique that encourages smoothness in the latent conditioning manifold. Extensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-arts on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant improvements on generating photo-realistic images conditioned on text descriptions.",

To reduce this gap, we propose Simulated+Unsupervised (S+U) learning, where the task is to learn a model to improve the realism of a simulators output using unlabeled real data, while preserving the annotation information from the simulator. We develop a method for S+U learning that uses an adversarial network similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), but with synthetic images as inputs instead of random vectors. We make several key modifications to the standard GAN algorithm to preserve annotations, avoid artifacts, and stabilize training: (i) a self-regularization term, (ii) a local adversarial loss, and (iii) updating the discriminator using a history of refined images. We show that this enables generation of highly realistic images, which we demonstrate both qualitatively and with a user study. We quantitatively evaluate the generated images by training models for gaze estimation and hand pose estimation. We show a significant improvement over using synthetic images, and achieve state-of-the-art results on the MPIIGaze dataset without any labeled real data.",

This is mainly because the discriminator is memorizing the exact training set. To combat it, we propose Differentiable Augmentation (DiffAugment), a simple method that improves the data efficiency of GANs by imposing various types of differentiable augmentations on both real and fake samples. Previous attempts to directly augment the training data manipulate the distribution of real images, yielding little benefit; DiffAugment enables us to adopt the differentiable augmentation for the generated samples, effectively stabilizes training, and leads to better convergence. Experiments demonstrate consistent gains of our method over a variety of GAN architectures and loss functions for both unconditional and class-conditional generation. With DiffAugment, we achieve a state-of-the-art FID of 6.80 with an IS of 100.8 on ImageNet 128x128. Furthermore, with only 20% training data, we can match the top performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.

The residual multiscale dense block is presented in the generator, where the multiscale, dense concatenation, and residual learning can boost the performance, render more details, and utilize previous features, respectively. And the discriminator employs computationally light spectral normalization to stabilize the training of the discriminator. Meanwhile, nonsaturating GAN loss function combining $L_1$ loss and gradient loss is presented to focus on image features of ground truth. Final enhanced results on synthetic and real underwater images demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, which outperforms nondeep and deep learning methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Unlike standard GANs relying only on data for training, here we encoded into the architecture of GANs the governing physical laws in the form of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) using automatic differentiation. In particular, we applied Wasserstein GANs with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) for its enhanced stability compared to vanilla GANs. We first tested WGAN-GP in approximating Gaussian processes of different correlation lengths based on data realizations collected from simultaneous reads at sparsely placed sensors. We obtained good approximation of the generated stochastic processes to the target ones even for a mismatch between the input noise dimensionality and the effective dimensionality of the target stochastic processes. We also studied the overfitting issue for both the discriminator and generator, and we found that overfitting occurs also in the generator in addition to the discriminator as previously reported. Subsequently, we considered the solution of elliptic SDEs requiring approximations of three stochastic processes, namely the solution, the forcing, and the diffusion coefficient. We used three generators for the PI-GANs, two of them were feed forward deep neural networks (DNNs) while the other one was the neural network induced by the SDE. Depending on the data, we employed one or multiple feed forward DNNs as the discriminators in PI-GANs. Here, we have demonstrated the accuracy and effectiveness of PI-GANs in solving SDEs for up to 30 dimensions, but in principle, PI-GANs could tackle very high dimensional problems given more sensor data with low-polynomial growth in computational cost.",

Several regularization techniques for stabilizing training have been proposed, but they introduce non-trivial computational overheads and interact poorly with existing techniques like spectral normalization. In this work, we propose a simple, effective training stabilizer based on the notion of consistency regularization---a popular technique in the semi-supervised learning literature. In particular, we augment data passing into the GAN discriminator and penalize the sensitivity of the discriminator to these augmentations. We conduct a series of experiments to demonstrate that consistency regularization works effectively with spectral normalization and various GAN architectures, loss functions and optimizer settings. Our method achieves the best FID scores for unconditional image generation compared to other regularization methods on CIFAR-10 and CelebA. Moreover, Our consistency regularized GAN (CR-GAN) improves state-of-the-art FID scores for conditional generation from 14.73 to 11.48 on CIFAR-10 and from 8.73 to 6.66 on ImageNet-2012.",

Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed regularization scheme 1) improves the generalization performance and stabilizes the learning dynamics of GAN models under limited training data, and 2) complements the recent data augmentation methods.

        "abstract": "Due to the real working conditions and data acquisition equipment, the collected working data of bearings are actually limited. Meanwhile, as the rolling bearing works in the normal state at most times, it is easy to raise the imbalance problem of fault types which restricts the diagnosis accuracy and stability. To solve these problems, we present an imbalanced fault diagnosis method based on the generative adversarial network (GAN) and provide a comparative study in detail. The key idea is utilizing GAN, a kind of deep learning technique, to generate synthetic samples for minority fault class and then improve the generalization ability of the fault diagnosis model. First, this method applies fast Fourier transform to pre-process the original vibration signal and then obtains the frequency spectrum of fault samples. Second, it uses the spectrum data as the input of GAN to generate the synthetic minority samples following the data distribution of the real samples. Finally, it puts the synthetic samples into the training set and builds a stacked denoising auto encoder model for fault diagnosis. To testify the effectiveness of the proposed method, a series of comparative experiments is carried out on the CWRU bearing dataset. The results show that the proposed method can provide a better solution for imbalanced fault diagnosis on the basis of generating similar fault samples. As a comparative study, the proposed method is compared to several diagnostic methods with traditional time-frequency domain characteristics. Moreover, we also demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms three widely used sample synthesis techniques, such as random oversampling, synthetic minority oversampling technique, and the principal curve-based oversampling method in terms of diagnosis accuracy and numerical stability.",

Arguably their most significant impact has been in the area of computer vision where great advances have been made in challenges such as plausible image generation, image-to-image translation, facial attribute manipulation, and similar domains. Despite the significant successes achieved to date, applying GANs to real-world problems still poses significant challenges, three of which we focus on here. These are as follows: (1) the generation of high quality images, (2) diversity of image generation, and (3) stabilizing training. Focusing on the degree to which popular GAN technologies have made progress against these challenges, we provide a detailed review of the state-of-the-art in GAN-related research in the published scientific literature. We further structure this review through a convenient taxonomy we have adopted based on variations in GAN architectures and loss functions. While several reviews for GANs have been presented to date, none have considered the status of this field based on their progress toward addressing practical challenges relevant to computer vision. Accordingly, we review and critically discuss the most popular architecture-variant, and loss-variant GANs, for tackling these challenges. Our objective is to provide an overview as well as a critical analysis of the status of GAN research in terms of relevant progress toward critical computer vision application requirements. As we do this we also discuss the most compelling applications in computer vision in which GANs have demonstrated considerable success along with some suggestions for future research directions.

On the one hand, this interaction term explains the origin of the slow-down effect in the convergence of Simultaneous Gradient Ascent (SGA) to stable Nash equilibria. On the other hand, for the unstable equilibria, exponential convergence can be proved thanks to the interaction term, for three modified dynamics which have been proposed to stabilize GAN training: Optimistic Mirror Descent (OMD), Consensus Optimization (CO) and Predictive Method (PM). The analysis uncovers the intimate connections among these stabilizing techniques, and provides detailed characterization on the choice of learning rate.",

However, there are many problems that are inherently not pixel-wise classification problems but are nevertheless frequently formulated as semantic segmentation. This ill-posed formulation consequently necessitates hand-crafted scenario-specific and computationally expensive post-processing methods to convert the per pixel probability maps to final desired outputs. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) can be used to make the semantic segmentation network output to be more realistic or better structure-preserving, decreasing the dependency on potentially complex post-processing. In this work, we propose EL-GAN: a GAN framework to mitigate the discussed problem using an embedding loss. With EL-GAN, we discriminate based on learned embeddings of both the labels and the prediction at the same time. This results in more stable training due to having better discriminative information, benefiting from seeing both `fake' and `real' predictions at the same time. This substantially stabilizes the adversarial training process. We use the TuSimple lane marking challenge to demonstrate that with our proposed framework it is viable to overcome the inherent anomalies of posing it as a semantic segmentation problem. Not only is the output considerably more similar to the labels when compared to conventional methods, the subsequent post-processing is also simpler and crosses the competitive 96% accuracy threshold.",

Inspired by the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) to image-to-image task, we propose a novel FuseGAN to fulfill the images-to-image for multi-focus image fusion. To satisfy the requirement of dual input-to-one output, the encoder of the generator in FuseGAN is designed as a Siamese network. The least square GAN objective is employed to enhance the training stability of FuseGAN, resulting in an accurate confidence map for focus region detection. Also, we exploit the convolutional conditional random fields technique on the confidence map to reach a refined final decision map for better focus region detection. Moreover, due to the lack of a large-scale standard dataset, we synthesize a large enough multi-focus image dataset based on a public natural image dataset PASCAL VOC 2012, where we utilize a normalized disk point spread function to simulate the defocus and separate the background and foreground in the synthesis for each image. We conduct extensive experiments on two public datasets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results demonstrate that the proposed method presents accurate decision maps for focus regions in multi-focus images, such that the fused images are superior to 11 recent state-of-the-art algorithms, not only in visual perception, but also in quantitative analysis in terms of five metrics.",

Focusing on the lack of training images of grape leaf diseases, this paper proposes a novel model named Leaf GAN, which is based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), to generate images of four different grape leaf diseases for training identification models. A generator model with degressive channels is first designed to generate grape leaf disease images; then, the dense connectivity strategy and instance normalization are fused into an efficient discriminator to identify real and fake disease images by utilizing their excellent feature extraction capability on grape leaf lesions. Finally, the deep regret gradient penalty method is applied to stabilize the training process of the model. Using a total of 4,062 grape leaf disease images, the Leaf GAN model ultimately generates 8,124 grape leaf disease images. The generated grape leaf disease images based on Leaf GAN model can obtain better performance than DCGAN and WGAN in terms of the Fr\u00e9chet inception distance. The experimental results show that the proposed Leaf GAN model generates sufficient grape leaf disease images with prominent lesions, providing a feasible solution for the data augmentation of grape leaf disease images. For the eight prevailing classification models with the expanded dataset, the identification performance based on CNNs indicated higher accuracies, whereby all the accuracies were better than those of the initial dataset with other data augmentation methods. Among them, Xception achieves a recognition accuracy of 98.70% on the testing set. The results demonstrate that the proposed data augmentation method represents a new approach to overcoming the overfitting problem in disease identification and can effectively improve the identification accuracy.",

However, emerging CPS fields suffer from imbalanced and missing sample data, which makes the training of IDS difficult. In this paper, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) based intrusion detection system (G-IDS), where GAN generates synthetic samples, and IDS gets trained on them along with the original ones. G-IDS also fixes the difficulties of imbalanced or missing data problems.

To overcome such a problem, we propose in this paper the Least Squares Generative Adversarial Networks (LSGANs) which adopt the least squares loss for both the discriminator and the generator. We show that minimizing the objective function of LSGAN yields minimizing the Pearson <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\chi ^2$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:msup><mml:mi>\u03c7</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"mao-ieq1-2872043.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> divergence. We also show that the derived objective function that yields minimizing the Pearson <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\chi ^2$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:msup><mml:mi>\u03c7</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"mao-ieq2-2872043.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> divergence performs better than the classical one of using least squares for classification. There are two benefits of LSGANs over regular GANs. First, LSGANs are able to generate higher quality images than regular GANs. Second, LSGANs perform more stably during the learning process. For evaluating the image quality, we conduct both qualitative and quantitative experiments, and the experimental results show that LSGANs can generate higher quality images than regular GANs. Furthermore, we evaluate the stability of LSGANs in two groups. One is to compare between LSGANs and regular GANs without gradient penalty. We conduct three experiments, including Gaussian mixture distribution, difficult architectures, and a newly proposed method \u2014 datasets with small variability, to illustrate the stability of LSGANs. The other one is to compare between LSGANs with gradient penalty (LSGANs-GP) and WGANs with gradient penalty (WGANs-GP). The experimental results show that LSGANs-GP succeed in training for all the difficult architectures used in WGANs-GP, including 101-layer ResNet.",

Machine learning (ML) has been applied for tasks that are important for smart grid operation including energy consumption and generation forecasting, anomaly detection, and state estimation. These ML solutions commonly require sufficient historical data; however, this data is often not readily available because of reasons such as data collection costs and concerns regarding security and privacy. This paper introduces a recurrent generative adversarial network (R-GAN) for generating realistic energy consumption data by learning from real data. Generativea adversarial networks (GANs) have been mostly used for image tasks (e.g., image generation, super-resolution), but here they are used with time series data. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) from image GANs are replaced with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) because of RNN\u2019s ability to capture temporal dependencies. To improve training stability and increase quality of generated data, Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) and Metropolis-Hastings GAN (MH-GAN) approaches were applied. The accuracy is further improved by adding features created with ARIMA and Fourier transform. Experiments demonstrate that data generated by R-GAN can be used for training energy forecasting models.",

Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have emerged as an effective approach in style transfer by adversarially training the generator to synthesize convincing counterfeits. However, traditional GAN suffers from the mode collapse issue, resulting in unstable training and making style transfer quality difficult to guarantee. In addition, the GAN generator is only compatible with one style, so a series of GANs must be trained to provide users with choices to transfer more than one kind of style. In this paper, we focus on tackling these challenges and limitations to improve style transfer. We propose adversarial gated networks (Gated-GAN) to transfer multiple styles in a single model. The generative networks have three modules: an encoder, a gated transformer, and a decoder. Different styles can be achieved by passing input images through different branches of the gated transformer. To stabilize training, the encoder and decoder are combined as an auto-encoder to reconstruct the input images. The discriminative networks are used to distinguish whether the input image is a stylized or genuine image. An auxiliary classifier is used to recognize the style categories of transferred images, thereby helping the generative networks generate images in multiple styles. In addition, Gated-GAN makes it possible to explore a new style by investigating styles learned from artists or genres. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of the proposed model for multi-style transfer.",

Since constraining the Lipschitz constants of neural networks is a common way to stabilize generative models, there is a provable trade-off between the ability of push-forward models to approximate multimodal distributions and the stability of their training.

We achieve this by employing for GANs a contrastive learning and mutual information maximization approach, and perform extensive analyses to understand sources of improvements. Our approach significantly stabilizes GAN training and improves GAN performance for image synthesis across five datasets under the same training and evaluation conditions against state-of-the-art works. In particular, compared to the state-of-the-art SSGAN, our approach does not suffer from poorer performance on image domains such as faces, and instead improves performance significantly. Our approach is simple to implement and practical: it involves only one auxiliary objective, has low computational cost, and performs robustly across a wide range of training settings and datasets without any hyperparameter tuning. For reproducibility, our code is available in the open-source GAN library, Mimicry [34].",

This way, high-dimensional classical data only enters the classical model and need not be prepared in a quantum circuit. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on a credit card fraud dataset. For this dataset our method shows performance on par with classical methods in terms of the F 1 score.

These models are used to estimate the underlying distribution of a dataset and randomly generate realistic samples according to their estimated distribution. However, the data used to train these models is often sensitive, thus prompting the need to evaluate information leakage from producing synthetic samples with generative models---specifically, whether an adversary can infer information about the data used to train the models. In this paper, we present the first membership inference attack on generative models. To mount the attack, we train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which combines a discriminative and a generative model, to detect overfitting and recognize inputs that are part of training datasets by relying on the discriminator's capacity to learn statistical differences in distributions. We present attacks based on both white-box and black-box access to the target model, and show how to improve the latter using limited auxiliary knowledge of dataset samples. We test our attacks on several state-of-the-art models, such as Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN), Boundary Equilibrium GAN (BEGAN), and the combination of DCGAN with a Variational Autoencoder (DCGAN+VAE), using datasets consisting of complex representations of faces (LFW), objects (CIFAR-10), and medical images (Diabetic Retinopathy). The white-box attacks are 100% successful at inferring which samples were used to train the target model, and the black-box ones succeeds with 80% accuracy. Finally, we discuss the sensitivity of our attacks to different training parameters, and their robustness against mitigation strategies, finding that successful defenses often result in significant worse performances of the generative models in terms of training stability and/or sample quality.",

First, using the ACGAN framework to add fault label information to the input sample improves the quality of the generated sample. The Wasserstein distance is introduced into the loss function in ACGAN, which effectively solves the problems of gradient collapse and gradient disappearance. Second, the weight penalty is added to the loss function, which increases the expression ability of the network compared with the weight clipping and effectively solves the problem of unstable network training. Finally, an independent fault diagnosis classifier is introduced to balance the compatibility of discrimination and classification. The convolutional block attention module (CBAM) based on the attention mechanism is introduced to fuse its output with the features extracted by the convolution module, which improves the representation ability of the fault diagnosis network and realizes high-precision fault diagnosis. The method is applied to the public bearing dataset of Western Reserve University and the bearing simulation dataset of the Yanshan University Laboratory, which can generate high-quality multimode fault samples more efficiently and can be used to help the training of fault diagnosis models based on deep learning.

Due to the gradient parameters of the deep neural network contain the data distribution of the training samples, they can easily remember the training samples. When GAN is applied to private or sensitive data, for instance, patient medical records, as private information may be leakage. To address this issue, we propose a Privacy-preserving Generative Adversarial Network (PPGAN) model, in which we achieve differential privacy in GANs by adding well-designed noise to the gradient during the model learning procedure. Besides, we introduced the Moments Accountant strategy in the PPGAN training process to improve the stability and compatibility of the model by controlling privacy loss. We also give a mathematical proof of the differential privacy discriminator.

In our SARA-GAN, the relative average discriminator theory is applied to make full use of the prior knowledge, in which half of the input data of the discriminator is true and half is fake. At the same time, a self-attention mechanism is incorporated into the high-layer of the generator to build long-range dependence of the image, which can overcome the problem of limited convolution kernel size.

        "abstract": "We deal with the problem of few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL), which requires a model to continuously recognize new categories for which limited training data are available. Existing FSCIL methods depend on prior knowledge to regularize the model parameters for combating catastrophic forgetting. Devising an effective prior in a low-data regime, however, is not trivial. The memory-replay based approaches from the fully-supervised class incremental learning (CIL) literature cannot be used directly for FSCIL as the generative memory-replay modules of CIL are hard to train from few training samples. However, generative replay can tackle both the stability and plasticity of the models simultaneously by generating a large number of class-conditional samples. Convinced by this fact, we propose a generative modeling-based FSCIL framework using the paradigm of memory-replay in which a novel conditional few-shot generative adversarial network (GAN) is incrementally trained to produce visual features while ensuring the stability-plasticity trade-off through novel loss functions and combating the mode-collapse problem effectively. Furthermore, the class-specific synthesized visual features from the few-shot GAN are constrained to match the respective latent semantic prototypes obtained from a well-defined semantic space. We find that the advantages of this semantic restriction is two-fold, in dealing with forgetting, while making the features class-discernible. The model requires a single per-class prototype vector to be maintained in a dynamic memory buffer. Experimental results on the benchmark and large-scale CiFAR-100, CUB-200, and Mini-ImageNet confirm the superiority of our model over the current FSCIL state of the art.",

Although GANs can accurately model complex distributions, they are known to be difficult to train due to instabilities caused by a difficult minimax optimization problem. In this paper, we view the problem of training GANs as finding a mixed strategy in a zero-sum game. Building on ideas from online learning we propose a novel training method named Chekhov GAN 1 . On the theory side, we show that our method provably converges to an equilibrium for semi-shallow GAN architectures, i.e. architectures where the discriminator is a one layer network and the generator is arbitrary. On the practical side, we develop an efficient heuristic guided by our theoretical results, which we apply to commonly used deep GAN architectures. On several real world tasks our approach exhibits improved stability and performance compared to standard GAN training.",

Since generative adversarial nets (GANs) have shown competitive results on general text generation, they are extended for category text generation in some previous works. However, the complicated model structures and learning strategies limit their performance and exacerbate the training instability. This paper proposes a category-aware GAN (CatGAN) which consists of an efficient category-aware model for category text generation and a hierarchical evolutionary learning algorithm for training our model. The category-aware model directly measures the gap between real samples and generated samples on each category, then reducing this gap will guide the model to generate high-quality category samples. The Gumbel-Softmax relaxation further frees our model from complicated learning strategies for updating CatGAN on discrete data. Moreover, only focusing on the sample quality normally leads the mode collapse problem, thus a hierarchical evolutionary learning algorithm is introduced to stabilize the training procedure and obtain the trade-off between quality and diversity while training CatGAN. Experimental results demonstrate that CatGAN outperforms most of the existing state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Supervised classification methods have been widely utilized for the quality assurance of the advanced manufacturing process, such as additive manufacturing (AM) for anomaly (defects) detection. However, since abnormal states (with defects) occur much less frequently than normal ones (without defects) in a manufacturing process, the number of sensor data samples collected from a normal state is usually much more than that from an abnormal state. This issue causes imbalanced training data for classification analysis, thus deteriorating the performance of detecting abnormal states in the process. It is beneficial to generate effective artificial sample data for the abnormal states to make a more balanced training set. To achieve this goal, this paper proposes a novel data augmentation method based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) using additive manufacturing process image sensor data. The novelty of our approach is that a standard GAN and classifier are jointly optimized with techniques to stabilize the learning process of standard GAN. The diverse and high-quality generated samples provide balanced training data to the classifier. The iterative optimization between GAN and classifier provides the high-performance classifier. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by both open-source data and real-world case studies in polymer and metal AM processes.",

As shown in recent analysis, training is often undermined by the probability distribution of the data being zero on neighborhoods of the data space. We notice that the distributions of real and generated data should match even when they undergo the same filtering. Therefore, to address the limited support problem we propose to train GANs by using different filtered versions of the real and generated data distributions. In this way, filtering does not prevent the exact matching of the data distribution, while helping training by extending the support of both distributions. As filtering we consider adding samples from an arbitrary distribution to the data, which corresponds to a convolution of the data distribution with the arbitrary one. We also propose to learn the generation of these samples so as to challenge the discriminator in the adversarial training. We show that our approach results in a stable and well-behaved training of even the original minimax GAN formulation. Moreover, our technique can be incorporated in most modern GAN formulations and leads to a consistent improvement on several common datasets.",

However GANs are known to be very hard to train, suffering from problems such as mode collapse and disturbing visual artifacts. Batch normalization (BN) techniques have been introduced to address the training. Though BN accelerates the training in the beginning, our experiments show that the use of BN can be unstable and negatively impact the quality of the trained model. The evaluation of BN and numerous other recent schemes for improving GAN training is hindered by the lack of an effective objective quality measure for GAN models. To address these issues, we first introduce a weight normalization (WN) approach for GAN training that significantly improves the stability, efficiency and the quality of the generated samples. To allow a methodical evaluation, we introduce squared Euclidean reconstruction error on a test set as a new objective measure, to assess training performance in terms of speed, stability, and quality of generated samples. Our experiments with a standard DCGAN architecture on commonly used datasets (CelebA, LSUN bedroom, and CIFAR-10) indicate that training using WN is generally superior to BN for GANs, achieving 10% lower mean squared loss for reconstruction and significantly better qualitative results than BN. We further demonstrate the stability of WN on a 21-layer ResNet trained with the CelebA data set. The code for this paper is available at this https URL",

In this work, we propose training a single generator simultaneously against an array of discriminators, each of which looks at a different random low-dimensional projection of the data. Individual discriminators, now provided with restricted views of the input, are unable to reject generated samples perfectly and continue to provide meaningful gradients to the generator throughout training. Meanwhile, the generator learns to produce samples consistent with the full data distribution to satisfy all discriminators simultaneously. We demonstrate the practical utility of this approach experimentally, and show that it is able to produce image samples with higher quality than traditional training with a single discriminator.",

Answering such questions could enable us to develop new insights and better models. In this work, we present an analytic framework to visualize and understand GANs at the unit-, object-, and scene-level. We first identify a group of interpretable units that are closely related to concepts with a segmentation-based network dissection method. We quantify the causal effect of interpretable units by measuring the ability of interventions to control objects in the output. Finally, we examine the contextual relationship between these units and their surrounding by inserting the discovered concepts into new images. We show several practical applications enabled by our framework, from comparing internal representations across different layers, models, and datasets, to improving GANs by locating and removing artifact-causing units, to interactively manipulating objects in the scene.

However, GANs are limited in two ways. They often learn distributions with low support---a phenomenon known as mode collapse---and they do not guarantee the existence of a probability density, which makes evaluating generalization using predictive log-likelihood impossible. In this paper, we develop the prescribed GAN (PresGAN) to address these shortcomings. PresGANs add noise to the output of a density network and optimize an entropy-regularized adversarial loss. The added noise renders tractable approximations of the predictive log-likelihood and stabilizes the training procedure. The entropy regularizer encourages PresGANs to capture all the modes of the data distribution. Fitting PresGANs involves computing the intractable gradients of the entropy regularization term; PresGANs sidestep this intractability using unbiased stochastic estimates. We evaluate PresGANs on several datasets and found they mitigate mode collapse and generate samples with high perceptual quality. We further found that PresGANs reduce the gap in performance in terms of predictive log-likelihood between traditional GANs and variational autoencoders (VAEs).",

To address both of the drawbacks, our method adopts two-stage training and network interpolation. The two-stage training is effective to stabilize the training. Moreover, the network interpolation utilizes the models in both stages and reduces undesirable noise and artifacts, while maintaining important edges. Hence, we can control the trade-off between perceptual quality and fidelity without re-training models. The experimental results show that our model can reconstruct high quality images. Furthermore, our user study confirms that our reconstructions are preferable to state-of-the-art GAN-based image compression model.

Recently, their class conditional extensions (e.g., conditional GAN (cGAN) and auxiliary classifier GAN (AC-GAN)) have attracted much attention owing to their ability to learn the disentangled representations and to improve the training stability. However, their training requires the availability of large-scale accurate class-labeled data, which are often laborious or impractical to collect in a real-world scenario. To remedy this, we propose a novel family of GANs called label-noise robust GANs (rGANs), which, by incorporating a noise transition model, can learn a clean label conditional generative distribution even when training labels are noisy. In particular, we propose two variants: rAC-GAN, which is a bridging model between AC-GAN and the label-noise robust classification model, and rcGAN, which is an extension of cGAN and solves this problem with no reliance on any classifier. In addition to providing the theoretical background, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our models through extensive experiments using diverse GAN configurations, various noise settings, and multiple evaluation metrics (in which we tested 402 conditions in total).",

The outstanding results achieved by deep learning techniques in developing such applications have improved the diagnostic accuracy. Nevertheless, the performance of these models is heavily dependent on the volume of labelled data used for training, which is unfortunately not available. To address this problem, traditional data augmentation is usually adopted. Recently, the emergence of a generative adversarial network (GAN) seems a more plausible solution, where synthetic images are generated. In this work, we have developed a deep generative adversarial network (DGAN) multi-class classifier, which can generate skin problem images by learning the true data distribution from the available images. Unlike the usual two-class classifier, we have developed a multi-class solution, and to address the class-imbalanced dataset, we have taken images from different datasets available online. One main challenge faced during our development is mainly to improve the stability of the DGAN model during the training phase. To analyse the performance of GAN, we have developed two CNN models in parallel based on the architecture of ResNet50 and VGG16 by augmenting the training datasets using the traditional rotation, flipping, and scaling methods. We have used both labelled and unlabelled data for testing to test the models. DGAN has outperformed the conventional data augmentation by achieving a performance of 91.1% for the unlabelled dataset and 92.3% for the labelled dataset. On the contrary, CNN models with data augmentation have achieved a performance of up to 70.8% for the unlabelled dataset. The outcome of our DGAN confirms the ability of the model to learn from unlabelled datasets and yet produce a good diagnosis result.",

        "abstract": "The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has shown powerfulness in various real-world artificial intelligence applications. However, its network architecture is generally designed through a manual trial-and-error process, which is relatively tedious, slow, and sub-optimal. This paper hence develops an evolutionary architectural search (EAS) technique to automate the entire design process of the GAN. In particular, different objective functions are used in the generator of a GAN as variation operators. This helps train the generator with various candidate architectures and their associated weights to play adversarial training against the discriminator of the GAN. Following evaluations by the discriminator, superior candidate generators survive to the next generation and evolve for potentially better architectures and their weights simultaneously, leading to more stabilized GANs with improved performance. The GAN designed through EAS is termed an EAS-GAN in this paper and is tested against existing evolutionary and other state-of-the-art GANs. The test results show that the EAS-GAN offers better generative performance overall, with the Fr\u00e9chet inception distance scoring 22.1, 38.8, and 8.3 on the CIFAR-10, STL-10, and LSUN bedroom data sets, respectively.",

MCTS is computationally intensive, but the performance of REGS is worse than MCTS.

Training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for logo synthesis on such multi-modal data is not straightforward and results in mode collapse for some state-of-the-art methods.

Our approach is inspired by a connection of GANs and reinforcement learning under a variational perspective. The connection leads to (1) probability ratio clipping that regularizes generator training to prevent excessively large updates, and (2) a sample re-weighting mechanism that stabilizes discriminator training by downplaying bad-quality fake samples. We provide theoretical analysis on the convergence of our approach.

In spite of this success, they gained a reputation for being difficult to train, what results in a time-consuming and human-involved development process to use them. We consider an alternative training process, named SGAN, in which several adversarial \"local\" pairs of networks are trained independently so that a \"global\" supervising pair of networks can be trained against them. The goal is to train the global pair with the corresponding ensemble opponent for improved performances in terms of mode coverage. This approach aims at increasing the chances that learning will not stop for the global pair, preventing both to be trapped in an unsatisfactory local minimum, or to face oscillations often observed in practice. To guarantee the latter, the global pair never affects the local ones. The rules of SGAN training are thus as follows: the global generator and discriminator are trained using the local discriminators and generators, respectively, whereas the local networks are trained with their fixed local opponent. Experimental results on both toy and real-world problems demonstrate that this approach outperforms standard training in terms of better mitigating mode collapse, stability while converging and that it surprisingly, increases the convergence speed as well.",

However, training instability is still one of the open problems for all GAN-based algorithms. Quite a number of methods have been proposed to stabilize the training of GANs, the focuses of which were respectively put on the loss functions, regularization and normalization technologies, training algorithms, and model architectures. Different from the above methods, in this paper, a new perspective on stabilizing GANs training is presented. It is found that sometimes the images produced by the generator act like adversarial examples of the discriminator during the training process, which may be part of the reason causing the unstable training of GANs. With this finding, we propose the Direct Adversarial Training (DAT) method to stabilize the training process of GANs. Furthermore, we prove that the DAT method is able to minimize the Lipschitz constant of the discriminator adaptively. The advanced performance of DAT is verified on multiple loss functions, network architectures, hyper-parameters, and datasets. Specifically, DAT achieves significant improvements of 11.5% FID on CIFAR-100 unconditional generation based on SSGAN, 10.5% FID on STL-10 unconditional generation based on SSGAN, and 13.2% FID on LSUN-Bedroom unconditional generation based on SSGAN.",

        "abstract": "In conventional ultrasound (US) imaging, it is common to transmit several focused beams at multiple locations to generate a multi-focus image with constant lateral resolution throughout the image. However, this method comes at the expense of a loss in temporal resolution, which is important in applications requiring both high-frame rate and constant lateral resolution. Moreover, relative motions of the target with respect to the probe often exist due to hand tremors or biological motions, causing blurring artifacts in the multi-focus image. This article introduces a novel approach for multi-focus US image recovery based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) without a reduction in the frame-rate. Herein, a mapping function between the single-focus US image and multi-focus version for having a constant lateral resolution everywhere is estimated through different GANs. We use adversarial loss functions in addition to Mean Square Error (MSE) to generate more realistic ultrasound images. Moreover, we use the boundary seeking method for improving the stability of training, which is currently the main challenge in using GANs. Experiments on simulated and real phantoms as well as on ex vivo data are performed. Results confirm that having both adversarial loss function and boundary seeking training provides better results in terms of the mean opinion score test. Furthermore, the proposed method enhances the resolution and contrast indexes without sacrificing the frame-rate. As for the comparison with other approaches which are not based on NNs, the proposed approach gives similar results while requiring neither channel data nor computationally expensive algorithms.",

However, the uncoordinated charging of EVs brings negative effects to the power grid. Therefore, a new intelligent energy management strategy needs to be involved in the transportation electrification progress to address the variability of flexible loads and energy storage in the active distribution network. In this article, we have proposed a coordinated dispatch strategy of EVs and thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) based on a modified generative adversarial network (GAN). TCLs are utilized to complement the limits of EVs\u2019 driving behaviors. EVs are modeled as battery energy storage systems (BESSs), and TCLs are modeled as virtual energy storage systems (VESSs). Machine learning is integrated into a bilevel optimization problem to determine the steady-state power dispatch and the energy storage control of the VESS. The proposed method is verified on the IEEE 33-bus system. Based on the simulation results, it can be concluded that the proposed data-driven method can outperform the conventional model-based method in terms of accuracy. Also, the modified GAN helps the training process to be less affected by the missing data. Comparative studies are conducted to show that the coordinated dispatch strategy of EVs and TCLs can maintain the voltage stability in the distribution system by compensating for the drawbacks of each other.",

The CycleGAN based voice conversion, however, can be used only for a pair of speakers, i.e., one-to-one voice conversion between two speakers. In this paper, we extend the CycleGAN by conditioning the network on speakers. As a result, the proposed method can perform many-to-many voice conversion among multiple speakers using a single generative adversarial network (GAN). Compared to building multiple CycleGANs for each pair of speakers, the proposed method reduces the computational and spatial cost significantly without compromising the sound quality of the converted voice.

For training-based channel estimations, increasing the length of a training sequence may improve the accuracy of channel estimation but causes a higher overhead. Nevertheless, this paper shows that benefiting from generative adversarial networks (GANs), which is an emerging deep learning framework, the accuracy of channel estimation can be improved without transmitting a longer training sequence. To this end, this paper proposes a GAN-based channel estimation enhancement algorithm, where GANs are trained online with receive sequence so as to obtain a longer mimic sequence and enhance channel estimation. In order to address the problem of improving the training stability and the learning ability of GANs, this paper proposes a novel framework by integrating a conditional GAN with an improved Wasserstein GAN. Furthermore, a strategy based on a lookup table is proposed to alleviate overfitting that may occur during the training of GANs. Simulation results indicate that the proposed GAN-based channel estimation enhancement algorithm can benefit the conventional training-based channel estimation, yielding lower relative error performance, especially in the low SNR regions.",

        "abstract": "Recent generative adversarial network based methods have shown promising results for the charming but challenging task of synthesizing images from text descriptions. These approaches can generate images with general shape and color but often produce distorted global structures with unnatural local semantic details. It is due to ineffectiveness of convolutional neural networks in capturing the high-level semantic information for pixel-level image synthesis. In this paper, we propose a Dual Attentional Generative Adversarial Network (DualAttn-GAN) in which the dual attention modules are introduced to enhance local details and global structures by attending to related features from relevant words and different visual regions. As one of the dual modules, the textual attention module is designed to explore the fine-grained interaction between vision and language. On the other hand, visual attention module models internal representations of vision from channel and spatial axes, which can better capture the global structures. Meanwhile, we apply an attention embedding module to merge multi-path features. Furthermore, we present an inverted residual structure to boost representation power of CNNs and apply spectral normalization to stabilize GAN training. With extensive experimental validation on two benchmark datasets, our method significantly improves state-of-the-art models over the evaluation metrics of inception score and Fr\u00e9chet inception distance.",

In addition, the training stage of these methods has the common problem of model collapse that degrades the quality of the generated images. To tackle these issues, we propose a Dual Generator Generative Adversarial Network (G$^2$GAN), which is a robust and scalable approach allowing to perform unpaired image-to-image translation for multiple domains using only dual generators within a single model. Moreover, we explore different optimization losses for better training of G$^2$GAN, and thus make unpaired image-to-image translation with higher consistency and better stability. Extensive experiments on six publicly available datasets with different scenarios, i.e., architectural buildings, seasons, landscape and human faces, demonstrate that the proposed G$^2$GAN achieves superior model capacity and better generation performance comparing with existing image-to-image translation GAN models.",

However, in practical engineering application scenarios, mechanical equipment is usually in a normal state, and small and imbalanced (S & I) fault samples are common, which seriously reduces the accuracy and stability of the fault diagnosis model. To solve this problem, an auxiliary classifier generative adversarial network with spectral normalization (ACGAN-SN) is proposed in this paper. First, a generation module based on a deconvolution layer is built to generate false data from Gaussian noise. Second, to enhance the training stability of the model, the data label information is used to make label constraints on the generated fake data under the basic GAN framework. Spectral normalization constraints are imposed on the output of each layer of the neural network of the discriminator to realize the Lipschitz continuity condition so as to avoid vanishing or exploding gradients. Finally, based on the generated data and the original S & I dataset, seven kinds of bearing fault datasets are made, and the prediction results of the Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model is verified. The results show that the data generated by ACGAN-SN can significantly promote the performance of the fault diagnosis model under the S & I fault samples.",

However, it is a great challenge to achieve a highly accurate rolling bearing fault diagnosis because of the severe imbalance and distribution differences in fault data due to weak early fault features and interference from environmental noise. An intelligent fault diagnosis strategy for rolling bearings based on grayscale image transformation, a generative adversative network, and a convolutional neural network was proposed to solve this problem. First, the original vibration signal is converted into a grayscale image. Then more training samples are generated using GANs to solve severe imbalance and distribution differences in fault data. Finally, the rolling bearing condition detection and fault identification are carried out by using SECNN. The availability of the method is substantiated by experiments on datasets with different data imbalance ratios. In addition, the superiority of this diagnosis strategy is verified by comparing it with other mainstream intelligent diagnosis techniques. The experimental result demonstrates that this strategy can reach more than 99.6% recognition accuracy even under substantial environmental noise interference or changing working conditions and has good stability in the presence of a severe imbalance in fault data.",

Firstly, a generator is constructed which consists of shallow features extraction module, Laplacian pyramid module, and reconstruction module. Specifically, the Laplacian pyramid module is a pyramid-style encoder-decoder architecture, which progressively extracts the multi-scale features. Moreover, the attention module is equipped in the decoder to effectively decode the salient features.

Elucidating such structures remains challenging. Current momentum in deep learning and the powerful performance of generative adversarial networks (GANs) in complex domains, such as computer vision, inspires us to investigate GANs on their ability to generate physically-realistic protein tertiary structures. The analysis presented here shows that several GAN models fail to capture complex, distal structural patterns present in protein tertiary structures. The study additionally reveals that mechanisms touted as effective in stabilizing the training of a GAN model are not all effective, and that performance based on loss alone may be orthogonal to performance based on the quality of generated datasets. A novel contribution in this study is the demonstration that Wasserstein GAN strikes a good balance and manages to capture both local and distal patterns, thus presenting a first step towards more powerful deep generative models for exploring a possibly very diverse set of structures supporting diverse activities of a protein molecule in the cell.",

Moreover, we propose an element-wise addition of residual bias in the transformed feature space, which further helps stabilize GAN training in such settings. Our approach also leverages task similarity information based on the Fisher information matrix. Leveraging this knowledge from previous tasks significantly improves the model performance. In addition, the similarity measure also helps reduce the parameter growth in continual adaptation and helps to learn a compact model. In contrast to the recent approaches for continually-learned GANs, the proposed approach provides a memory-efficient way to perform effective continual data generation. Through extensive experiments on challenging and diverse datasets, we show that the feature-map-transformation approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods for continually-learned GANs, with substantially fewer parameters.

Focusing on the fact that standard GAN minimizes reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, we transfer the representative feature, which is extracted from the data distribution using a pre-trained autoencoder (AE), to the discriminator of standard GANs. Because the AE learns to minimize forward KL divergence, our GAN training with representative features is influenced by both reverse and forward KL divergence.

We also show that LSVGD dynamics has an implicit regularization, which is able to enhance particles\u2019 spread-out and diversity. Finally, we present an efficient way of applying particle-based variational inference on a general GAN training procedure no matter what loss function is adopted.

In this paper, we propose the Alpha-divergence Generative Adversarial Net (Alpha-GAN) which adopts the alpha divergence as the minimization objective function of generators. The alpha divergence can be regarded as a generalization of the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence, Pearson \u03c72 divergence, Hellinger divergence, etc. Our Alpha-GAN employs the power function as the form of adversarial loss for the discriminator with two-order indexes. These hyper-parameters make our model more flexible to trade off between the generated and target distributions. We further give a theoretical analysis of how to select these hyper-parameters to balance the training stability and the quality of generated images.

They have initially not been meant to be an image analysis tool, but to produce naturally looking images. The adversarial training paradigm has been proposed to stabilize generative methods, and has proven to be highly successful \u2013 though by no means from the first attempt. This chapter gives a basic introduction into the motivation for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and traces the path of their success by abstracting the basic task and working mechanism, and deriving the difficulty of early practical approaches. Methods for a more stable training will be shown, and also typical signs for poor convergence and their reasons. Though this chapter focuses on GANs that are meant for image generation and image analysis, the adversarial training paradigm itself is not specific to images, and also generalizes to tasks in image analysis. Examples of architectures for image semantic segmentation and abnormality detection will be acclaimed, before contrasting GANs with further generative modeling approaches lately entering the scene. This will allow a contextualized view on the limits but also benefits of GANs.",

Conventional methods for conditional traffic estimation usually focus on supervised settings, which require a large amount of labeled training data. However, in many urban planning applications, the large amount of traffic data in a new city can be hard or impossible to acquire. To tackle the conditional traffic estimation problem in data scarcity situations, we formulate the problem as a spatial transfer generative learning problem. Compared to prior spatial transfer learning frameworks with only single source city, we propose to extracts knowledge from multiple source cities to improve the estimation accuracy and transfer stability, which is a technically more challenging task. As a solution, we propose a new cross-city conditional traffic estimation method \u2014 Spatially-Transferable Generative Adversarial Networks (STrans-GAN) with novel pre-training and fine-tuning algorithms. STransGAN preserves diverse traffic patterns from multiple source cities through traffic clustering, and incorporates meta-learning idea into the pre-training process to learn a well-generalized model. During fine-tuning, we propose to add a cluster matching regularizer to realize the flexible adaptation in different scenarios. Through extensive experiments on multiple-city datasets, the effectiveness of STrans-GAN is proved.",

However, PET imaging can be prohibitive in terms of cost and planning, and is also among the imaging techniques with the highest dosage of radiation. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), in contrast, is more widely available and provides more flexibility when setting the desired image resolution. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of AD using MRI is difficult due to the very subtle physiological differences between healthy and AD subjects visible on MRI. As a result, many attempts have been made to synthesize PET images from MR images using generative adversarial networks (GANs) in the interest of enabling the diagnosis of AD from MR. Existing work on PET synthesis from MRI has largely focused on Conditional GANs, where MR images are used to generate PET images and subsequently used for AD diagnosis. There is no end-to-end training goal. This paper proposes an alternative approach to the aforementioned, where AD diagnosis is incorporated in the GAN training objective to achieve the best AD classification performance. Different GAN lossesare fine-tuned based on the discriminator performance, and the overall training is stabilized. The proposed network architecture and training regime show state-of-the-art performance for three- and four- class AD classification tasks.",

In this paper, a new domain-based anomaly detection method based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) is proposed.

However, the discriminator typically results in the instability of the GAN training due to the inadequate training problem: the search space is so huge that sampled translations are not sufficient for discriminator training. To address this issue and stabilize the GAN training, in this paper, we propose a novel Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Network for Neural Machine Translation (BGAN-NMT), which aims to introduce a generator model to act as the discriminator, whereby the discriminator naturally considers the entire translation space so that the inadequate training problem can be alleviated. To satisfy this property, generator and discriminator are both designed to model the joint probability of sentence pairs, with the difference that, the generator decomposes the joint probability with a source language model and a source-to-target translation model, while the discriminator is formulated as a target language model and a target-to-source translation model. To further leverage the symmetry of them, an auxiliary GAN is introduced and adopts generator and discriminator models of original one as its own discriminator and generator respectively. Two GANs are alternately trained to update the parameters. Experiment results on German-English and Chinese-English translation tasks demonstrate that our method not only stabilizes GAN training but also achieves significant improvements over baseline systems.",

However, non-standardized imaging pro-tocols are commonplace, which poses a fundamental challenge in large-scale cross-center CT image analysis. One approach to address the problem is to standardize CT images using generative adversarial network models (GAN). GAN learns the data distribution of training images and generate synthesized images under the same distribution. However, existing GAN models are not directly applicable to this task mainly due to the lack of constraints on the mode of data to generate. Furthermore, they treat every image equally, but in real applications, some images are more difficult to standardize than the others. All these may lead to the lack-of-detail problem in CT image synthesis. We present a new GAN model called GANai to mitigate the differences in radiomic features across CT images captured using non-standard imaging protocols. Given source images, GANai composes new images by specifying a high-level goal that the image features of the synthesized images should be similar to those of the standard images. GANai introduces an alternative improvement training strategy to alternatively and steadily improve model performance. The new training strategy enables a series of technical improvements, including phase-specific loss functions, phase-specific training data, and the adoption of ensemble learning, leading to better model performance. The experimental results show that GANai is significantly better than the existing state-of-the-art image synthesis algorithms on CT image standardization. Also, it significantly improves the efficiency and stability of GAN model training.",

During the training process, the discriminator will play against multiple generators simultaneously, where each generator adopts a different objective function as a mutation operation. Every time after the specified number of training iterations, the generator individuals will be evaluated and the best performing generator offspring will be retained for the next round of evolution. Based on this, the generator can continuously adjust the training strategy during training, and the self-attention module also enables the model to obtain the modeling ability of long-range dependencies.

However, these architectures leave limited control over shaping the output of the network. This paper explores a conditional extension to the StyleGAN architecture with the aim of firstly, improving on the low resolution results of previous research and, secondly, increasing the controllability of the output through the use of synthetic class-conditions. Furthermore, methods of extracting such class conditions are explored, where the challenge lies in the fact that, visual logo characteristics are hard to define. The introduced conditional style-based generator architecture is trained on the extracted class-conditions in two experiments and studied relative to the performance of an unconditional model. Results show that, whilst the unconditional model more closely matches the training distribution, high quality conditions enabled the embedding of finer details onto the latent space, leading to more diverse output.",

A possible explanation for training instabilities is the inherent imbalance between the networks: While the discriminator is trained directly on both real and fake samples, the generator only has control over the fake samples it produces since the real data distribution is fixed by the choice of a given dataset. We propose a simple modification that gives the generator control over the real samples which leads to a tempered learning process for both generator and discriminator. The real data distribution passes through a lens before being revealed to the discriminator, balancing the generator and discriminator by gradually revealing more detailed features necessary to produce high-quality results. The proposed module automatically adjusts the learning process to the current strength of the networks, yet is generic and easy to add to any GAN variant. In a number of experiments, we show that this can improve quality, stability and/or convergence speed across a range of different GAN architectures (DCGAN, LSGAN, WGAN-GP).",

GAN was initially trained on 500 normal brains and 110 IDH-mutant high-grade astocytomas, and paired contrast-enhanced T1-weighted and FLAIR MRI data were generated. Diagnostic models were developed from real IDH-wild type (n\u2009=\u200980) with real IDH-mutant glioblastomas (n\u2009=\u200938), or with synthetic IDH-mutant glioblastomas, or augmented by adding both real and synthetic IDH-mutant glioblastomas. Turing tests showed synthetic data showed reality (classification rate of 55%). Both the real and synthetic data showed that a more frontal or insular location (odds ratio [OR] 1.34 vs. 1.52; P\u2009=\u20090.04) and distinct non-enhancing tumor margins (OR 2.68 vs. 3.88; P\u2009<\u20090.001), which become significant predictors of IDH-mutation. In an independent validation set, diagnostic accuracy was higher for the augmented model (90.9% [40/44] and 93.2% [41/44] for each reader, respectively) than for the real model (84.1% [37/44] and 86.4% [38/44] for each reader, respectively).

In contrast to traditional GAN models, our SP-GAN is able to dynamically adjust the size and architecture of a network in the training stage by using the proposed self-growing and pruning mechanisms. To be more specific, we first train two seed networks as the generator and discriminator; each contains a small number of convolution kernels. Such small-scale networks are much easier and faster to train than large-capacity networks. Second, in the self-growing step, we replicate the convolution kernels of each seed network to augment the scale of the network, followed by fine-tuning the augmented/expanded network. More importantly, to prevent the excessive growth of each seed network in the self-growing stage, we propose a pruning strategy that reduces the redundancy of an augmented network, yielding the optimal scale of the network. Finally, we design a new adaptive loss function that is treated as a variable loss computational process for the training of the proposed SP-GAN model. By design, the hyperparameters of the loss function can dynamically adapt to different training stages. Experimental results obtained on a set of data sets demonstrate the merits of the proposed method, especially in terms of the stability and efficiency of network training. The source code of the proposed SP-GAN method is publicly available at https://github.com/Lambert-chen/SPGAN.git.",

        "abstract": "A myriad of recent literary works have leveraged generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate unseen evasion samples. The purpose is to annex the generated data with the original train set for adversarial training to improve the detection performance of machine learning (ML) classifiers. The quality of generated adversarial samples relies on the adequacy of training data samples. However, in low data regimes like medical diagnostic imaging and cybersecurity, the anomaly samples are scarce in number. This paper proposes a novel GAN design called evasion generative adversarial network (EVAGAN) that is more suitable for low data regime problems that use oversampling for detection improvement of ML classifiers. EVAGAN not only can generate evasion samples but its discriminator can act as an evasion-aware classifier. We have considered auxiliary classifier GAN (ACGAN) as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of EVAGAN on cybersecurity (ISCX-2014, CIC-2017, and CIC2018) botnet and computer vision (MNIST) datasets. We demonstrate that EVAGAN outperforms ACGAN for unbalanced datasets with respect to detection performance, training stability, and time complexity. EVAGAN's generator quickly learns to generate the low sample class and hardens its discriminator simultaneously. In contrast to ML classifiers that require security hardening after being adversarially trained by GAN-generated data, EVAGAN renders it needless. The experimental analysis proves that EVAGAN is an efficient evasion hardened model for low data regimes for the selected cybersecurity and computer vision datasets.",

However, the training of GANs becomes unstable when they are applied to SAR images, which reduces the feature extraction capability of the discriminator in GANs. This paper presents a new semi-supervised GANs with Multiple generators and a classifier (MCGAN). This model improves the stability of training for SAR images by employing multiple generators. A multi-classifier is introduced to the new GANs to utilize the labeled images during the training of the GANs, which shares the low level layers with the discriminator. Then, the layers of the trained discriminator and the classifier construct the recognition network for SAR images after having been finely tuned using a small number of the labeled images. Experiments on the Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) databases show that the proposed recognition network achieves a better and more stable recognition performance than several traditional semi-supervised methods as well as other GANs-based semi-supervised methods.",

To address this problem, we propose an novel Bayesian cyclic model and an integrated cyclic framework for interdomain mappings. The proposed method motivated by Bayesian GAN explores the full posteriors of cyclic model via sampling latent variables and optimizes the model with maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. Hence, we name it Bayesian CycleGAN. In addition, original CycleGAN cannot generate diversified results. But it is feasible for Bayesian framework to diversify generated images by replacing restricted latent variables in inference process. We evaluate the proposed Bayesian CycleGAN on multiple benchmark data sets, including Cityscapes, Maps, and Monet2photo. The proposed method improve the per-pixel accuracy by 15% for the Cityscapes semantic segmentation task within origin framework and improve 20% within the proposed integrated framework, showing better resilience to imbalance confrontation.

Built upon the Vanilla GAN's two-player game between the discriminator $D_1$ and the generator $G$, we introduce a peer discriminator $D_2$ to the min-max game. Similar to previous work using two discriminators, the first role of both $D_1$, $D_2$ is to distinguish between generated samples and real ones, while the generator tries to generate high-quality samples which are able to fool both discriminators. Different from existing methods, we introduce another game between $D_1$ and $D_2$ to discourage their agreement and therefore increase the level of diversity of the generated samples. This property alleviates the issue of early mode collapse by preventing $D_1$ and $D_2$ from converging too fast. We provide theoretical analysis for the equilibrium of the min-max game formed among $G, D_1, D_2$. We offer convergence behavior of DuelGAN as well as stability of the min-max game. It's worth mentioning that DuelGAN operates in the unsupervised setting, and the duel between $D_1$ and $D_2$ does not need any label supervision. Experiments results on a synthetic dataset and on real-world image datasets (MNIST, Fashion MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, CelebA, VGG, and FFHQ) demonstrate that DuelGAN outperforms competitive baseline work in generating diverse and high-quality samples, while only introduces negligible computation cost.",

To tackle this difficulty, this paper proposes a novel approach. Our idea is intuitive but proven to be very useful. In essence, it combines saturating loss and non-saturating loss into the loss function. Thus it will exploit the complementary statistical properties from two kinds of loss functions to effectively improve the training stability. We term our method twin discriminator Generative Adversarial Networks (TWGAN), which, unlike GAN, has a generator and a twin discriminator. The twin discriminator consists of two discriminators with identical architecture and both of them aim to distinguish whether the samples are from real data or fake data. We develop theoretical analysis to show that, given the optimal discriminators, optimizing the generator of TWGAN reduces to minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the distribution of generated data (<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$P_g$</tex-math></inline-formula>) and the distribution of real data (<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$P_data$</tex-math></inline-formula>), hence effectively addressing the training instability problem.

        "abstract": "We propose a novel regularizer to improve the training of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The motivation is that when the discriminator D spreads out its model capacity in the right way, the learning signals given to the generator G are more informative and diverse. These in turn help G to explore better and discover the real data manifold while avoiding large unstable jumps due to the erroneous extrapolation made by D. Our regularizer guides the rectifier discriminator D to better allocate its model capacity, by encouraging the binary activation patterns on selected internal layers of D to have a high joint entropy. Experimental results on both synthetic data and real datasets demonstrate improvements in stability and convergence speed of the GAN training, as well as higher sample quality. The approach also leads to higher classification accuracies in semi-supervised learning.",

Even though seismological research using low-cost micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) sensor received much attention recently, because of the lack of data recorded by such MEMS sensors whose data are usually polluted by different types of noise. Therefore, increasing seismic datasets is required by intelligently generating seismic data through data-augmentation techniques. However, it is difficult to characterize and measure the evolution process of seismic sequences, making the feature extraction and data generation of seismic sequences still a significant challenge. By combining the framework of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with long short-term memory (LSTM), attention mechanism and neural network (NN), a novel deep generation model (DGM) named EQGAN is developed to overcome the challenges, which can automatically capture the different time histories and dimension characteristics of seismic sequences, meanwhile stably generating high-quality seismic data. The reality of generated data is qualitatively clarified through the analysis of frequency domain and data autocorrelation distribution. Based on the High-throughput Screening (HTS) Theory, the quantitative evaluation index of statistical metrics is designed, and the generation performance of different machine learning models (standard GAN, LSTM, NN) is compared to prove the stability and effectiveness of EQGAN. The experimental results denote that the EQGAN has excellent stability and performance (up to 81%, much higher than that of other generation models), which provides a suitable data expansion approach for the field of seismological research.",

Electroluminescence (EL) imaging is able to image solar modules with higher resolution so that defects can be better detected. The current manual detection of EL images is slow and requires relevant expertise, so methods based on computer vision for automatic detection in EL images are appearing. However, due to the heterogeneously background of the EL images and the lack of defect samples, automatic detection of defects has been a challenging task. We design a model based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) and auto-encoder (AE) to perform defect detection for EL images of solar cells. It only requires normal images in the training process and detect defects by measuring the residuals between the test image and the constructed image generated by the generator. To reduce the effects of image distortion, we combine structural similarity index (SSIM) with feature residuals to train the encoder, which can get better results than the model using typical mean square error (MSE). During the detection phase, SSIM and MSE are combined as the anomaly score. Our method has higher recognition of defective EL images and achieves detection accuracy of 90.0% on the test set. Compared with the method using only MSE, the F1 score is increased obviously.",

A variety of discriminator loss functions have been developed to train GAN\u2019s discriminators and they all have a common structure: a sum of real and fake losses that only depends on the actual and generated data respectively. One challenge associated with an equally weighted sum of two losses is that the training may benefit one loss but harm the other, which we show causes instability and mode collapse. In this paper, we introduce a new family of discriminator loss functions that adopts a weighted sum of real and fake parts, which we call adaptive weighted loss functions or aw-loss functions. Using the gradients of the real and fake parts of the loss, we can adaptively choose weights to train a discriminator in the direction that benefits the GAN\u2019s stability. Our method can be potentially applied to any discriminator model with a loss that is a sum of the real and fake parts. Experiments validated the effectiveness of our loss functions on unconditional and conditional image generation tasks, improving the baseline results by a significant margin on CIFAR-10, STL-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets in Inception Scores (IS) and Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) metrics.",

By relating observed data to unobserved quantities of interest through PDEs, PI-GANs allow for the estimation of underlying probability distributions without their direct measurement (i.e. inverse problems). The scalable nature of GANs allows high-dimensional, spatially-dependent probability distributions (i.e., random fields) to be inferred, while incorporating prior information through PDEs allows the training datasets to be relatively small. \nIn this work, PI-GANs are demonstrated for the application of elastic modulus estimation in mechanical testing. Given measured deformation data, the underlying probability distribution of spatially-varying elastic modulus (stiffness) is learned. Two feed-forward deep neural network generators are used to model the deformation and material stiffness across a two dimensional domain. Wasserstein GANs with gradient penalty are employed for enhanced stability. In the absence of explicit training data, it is demonstrated that the PI-GAN learns to generate realistic, physically-admissible realizations of material stiffness by incorporating the PDE that relates it to the measured deformation. It is shown that the statistics (mean, standard deviation, point-wise distributions, correlation length) of these generated stiffness samples have good agreement with the true distribution.",

We first analyze the training dynamic of a prototypical Dirac GAN and adopt the widely-used closed-loop control (CLC) to improve its stability.

However, they usually suffer from instability and generalization issues which may lead to poor generations. Most existing works focus on stabilizing the training for the discriminators of GANs while ignoring their generalization issue. In this work, we aim to improve the generalization capability of GANs by promoting the local robustness within the small neighborhood of the training samples. We prove that the robustness in the small neighborhood of the training sets can lead to better generalization. Particularly, we design a new robust method called Robust Generative Adversarial Network (RGAN) in which the generator and discriminator compete with each other in a worst-case setting within a small Wasserstein ball. The generator tries to map the worst input distribution (rather than a Gaussian distribution used in most GANs) to the real data distribution, while the discriminator attempts to distinguish the real and fake distributions with the worst perturbations . Intuitively, the proposed RGAN can learn a good generator and discriminator that can even perform well on the worst-case input points. Strictly, we have proved that RGAN can obtain a tighter generalization upper bound than the traditional GANs under mild assumptions, ensuring a theoretical superiority of RGAN over GANs. We conduct our proposed method on five different baselines (five popular GAN models). And a series of experiments on CIFAR-10, STL-10 and CelebA datasets indicate that our proposed robust frameworks outperform five baseline models substantially and consistently.",

Network architecture plays a significant role in determining the final output of GANs, but designing a fine architecture demands extensive domain expertise. This article aims to address this issue by searching for high-performance generator\u2019s architectures through neural architecture search (NAS). The proposed approach, called evolutionary weight sharing GANs (EWSGAN), is based on weight sharing and comprises two steps. First, a supernet of the generator is trained using weight sharing. Second, a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is employed to identify optimal subnets from the supernet. These subnets inherit weights directly from the supernet for fitness assessment. Two strategies are used to stabilize the training of the generator supernet: 1) a fair single-path sampling strategy and 2) a discarding strategy. Experimental results indicate that the architecture searched by our method achieved a new state-of-the-art among NAS\u2013GAN methods with a Fr\u00e9chet inception distance (FID) of 9.09 and an inception score (IS) of 8.99 on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

We construct a generator supernet and search for the optimal generator network within it. We propose incorporating two attention mechanisms between each pair of nodes in the supernet.

The currently deployed satellites provide complementary data that are either of high spatial or high temporal resolutions. As a result, there is a clear trade\u2010off between space and time when considering a single data source. For the efficient monitoring of multiple environmental resources, various Earth science applications need data at high spatial and temporal resolutions. To address this need, many data fusion methods have been described in the literature, that rely on combining data snapshots from multiple sources. Traditional methods face limitations due to sensitivity to atmospheric disturbances and other environmental factors, resulting in noise, outliers, and missing data. This paper introduces Hydrological Generative Adversarial Network (Hydro\u2010GAN), a novel machine learning\u2010based method that utilizes modified GANs to enhance boundary accuracy when mapping low\u2010resolution MODIS data to high\u2010resolution Landsat\u20108 images. We propose a new non\u2010saturating loss function for the Hydro\u2010GAN generator, which maximizes the log of discriminator probabilities to promote stable updates and aid convergence. By focusing on reducing squared differences between real and synthetic images, our approach enhances training stability and overall performance. We specifically focus on mapping water bodies using MODIS and Landsat\u20108 imagery due to their relevance in water resource management tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Hydro\u2010GAN in generating high\u2010resolution water body maps, outperforming traditional methods in terms of boundary accuracy and overall quality.",

Traditional TF transforms, such as short-time Fourier transform (STFT), continuous wavelet transform (CWT), and S-transform (ST), suffer from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and their TF resolution is limited. Sparse TF (STF) transform has been proposed to address this disadvantage; however, expensive calculation and parameter selection present difficulties. We propose a self-supervised TF representation based on a generative adversarial networks (STFR-GAN) model in this study to map a one-dimensional (1D) seismic signal into a two-dimensional (2D) STF image. This model includes three components: a generator, discriminator, and reconstruction module. The generator is used to generate the STF spectrum of the input seismic trace, while the discriminator distinguishes if this generated STF spectrum is optimal. The reconstruction module serves as a physical constraint to ensure the accuracy of the generated STF spectrum. When implementing model training, the discriminator learns to identify the ideal STF and guides the generator to produce a TF spectrum closer to the ideal one. After model training, we applied the model to synthetic and field data to demonstrate its effectiveness and stability in characterizing the TF features of seismic data. Our results show that STFR-GAN can effectively provide TF representations with higher readability than those of traditional TF methods. Furthermore, effective TF representation can be applied to improve fluvial channel delineation.",

To address this issue, we propose a method, Meta-learning-based Open-set Recognition via Generative Adversarial Network (MORGAN), that can learn a finer separation between the closed and the open spaces. MORGAN seeks to generate class-conditioned adversarial samples for both the closed and open spaces in the few-shot regime using two GANs by judiciously tuning noise variance while ensuring discriminability using a novel Anti-Overlap Latent (AOL) regularizer. Adversarial samples from low noise variance amplify known class data density, and we use samples from high noise variance to augment \"known-unknowns\". A first-order episodic strategy is adapted to ensure stability in the GAN training. Finally, we introduce a combination of metric losses which push these augmented \"known-unknowns\" or outliers to disperse in the open space while condensing known class distributions.

One of the key issues is the generator\u2019s sensitivity to input data, which can cause sudden fluctuations in the generator\u2019s loss value with certain inputs. This sensitivity suggests an inadequate ability to resist disturbances in the generator, causing the discriminator\u2019s loss value to oscillate and negatively impacting the discriminator. Then, the negative feedback of discriminator is also not conducive to updating generator\u2019s parameters, leading to suboptimal image generation quality.

To achieve this target, we incorporate a learnable auxiliary penalty and an augmented discriminator, designed to control the generator and reinforce the discriminator\u2019s stability, respectively. We further apply our method to the Hinge and LSGANs loss functions, illustrating its efficacy in reducing the instability of both the generator and the discriminator.

With the development of deep learning techniques and the availability of imagery content on social media platforms, extensive research has focused on damage assessment. Through the use of geospatial data related to such incidents, the visual characteristics of these images can quickly determine the safety situation in the region. However, training accurate disaster classification models has proven to be challenging due to the lack of labeled imagery data in this domain. This paper proposes a disaster classification framework, which combines a set of synthesized diverse disaster images generated using generative adversarial networks (GANs) and domain-specific fine-tuning of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model. The proposed model utilizes bootstrap aggregating (bagging) to further stabilize the target predictions. Since past work in this domain mainly suffers from limited data resources, a sample dataset that highlights the issue of imbalanced classification of multiple natural disasters was constructed and augmented. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show the validity of the data augmentation method employed in producing a balanced dataset. Further experiments with various evaluation metrics verified the proposed framework\u2019s accuracy and generalization ability across different classes for the task of disaster classification in comparison to other state-of-the-art techniques.

Accordingly, generative models [e.g., generative adversarial network (GAN)] are typically used to synthesize the visual samples conditioned by the class semantic vectors and achieve remarkable progress for ZSL. However, existing GAN-based generative ZSL methods are based on hand-crafted models, which cannot adapt to various datasets/scenarios and fails to model instability. To alleviate these challenges, we propose evolutionary GAN search (termed EGANS) to automatically design the generative network with good adaptation and stability, enabling reliable visual feature sample synthesis for advancing ZSL. Specifically, we adopt cooperative dual evolution to conduct a neural architecture search (NAS) for both generator and discriminator under a unified evolutionary adversarial framework. EGANS is learned by two stages: 1) evolution generator architecture search and 2) evolution discriminator architecture search. During the evolution generator architecture search, we adopt a many-to-one adversarial training strategy to evolutionarily search for the optimal generator. Then the optimal generator is further applied to search for the optimal discriminator in the evolution discriminator architecture search with a similar evolution search algorithm. Once the optimal generator and discriminator are searched, we entail them into various generative ZSL baselines for ZSL classification. Extensive experiments show that EGANS consistently improve existing generative ZSL methods on the standard CUB, SUN, AWA2 and FLO datasets. The significant performance gains indicate that the evolutionary NAS explores a virgin field in ZSL.",

This paper proposes a new model called Identity Generative Adversarial Network (IGAN) that addresses these issues. This model is based on three modifications to the baseline deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN). The first change is to add a non-linear identity block to the architecture. This will make it easier for the model to fit complex data types and cut down on the time it takes to train. The second change is to smooth out the standard GAN loss function by using a modified loss function and label smoothing. The third and final change is to use minibatch training to let the model use other examples from the same minibatch as side information to improve the quality and variety of generated images. These changes help to stabilize the training process and improve the model\u2019s performance. The performance of the GAN models is compared using the inception score (IS) and the Fr\u00e9chet inception distance (FID), which are widely used metrics for evaluating the quality and diversity of generated images. The effectiveness of our approach was tested by comparing an IGAN model with other GAN models on the CelebA and stacked MNIST datasets. Results show that IGAN outperforms all the other models, achieving an IS of 13.95 and an FID of 43.71 after traning for 200 epochs. In addition to demonstrating the improvement in the performance of the IGAN, the instabilities, diversity, and fidelity of the models were investigated. The results showed that the IGAN was able to converge to a distribution of the real data more quickly. Furthermore, the experiments revealed that IGAN is capable of producing more stable and high-quality images. This suggests that IGAN is a promising approach for improving the training and performance of GANs and may have a range of applications in image synthesis and other areas.",

It uses on-policy Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize a reward signal derived from a GAN-like discriminator. A major drawback of GAIL is its training instability - it inherits the complex training dynamics of GANs, and the distribution shift introduced by RL. This can cause oscillations during training, harming its sample efficiency and final policy performance. Recent work has shown that control theory can help with the convergence of a GAN's training. This paper extends this line of work, conducting a control-theoretic analysis of GAIL and deriving a novel controller that not only pushes GAIL to the desired equilibrium but also achieves asymptotic stability in a 'one-step' setting. Based on this, we propose a practical algorithm 'Controlled-GAIL' (C-GAIL). On MuJoCo tasks, our controlled variant is able to speed up the rate of convergence, reduce the range of oscillation and match the expert's distribution more closely both for vanilla GAIL and GAIL-DAC.",

This mechanism aims to solve the mode collapse problem and enhance the training stability of the generated outputs. Within the SoftGAN, the objective of the discriminator is to learn a fuzzy concept of real data with a soft borderline between real and generated data. This objective is achieved by balancing the principles of maximum concept coverage and maximum expected entropy of fuzzy concepts. During the early training stage of the SoftGAN, the principle of maximum expected entropy of fuzzy concepts guides the learning process due to the significant divergence between the generated and real data. However, in the final stage of training, the principle of maximum concept coverage dominates as the divergence between the two distributions decreases. The dynamic borderline softening mechanism of the SoftGAN can be likened to a student (the generator) striving to create realistic images, with the tutor (the discriminator) dynamically guiding the student towards the right direction and motivating effective learning. The tutor gives appropriate encouragement or requirements according to abilities of the student at different stages, so as to promote the student to improve themselves better. Our approach offers both theoretical and practical benefits for improving GAN training. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of our SoftGAN approach in addressing mode collapse issues and generating high-quality outputs compared to existing approaches.",

VAEs are renowned for their robust probabilistic foundations and capacity for complex data representation learning, while GANs are celebrated for generating high-fidelity images. Despite their strengths, both models have limitations: VAEs often produce less sharp outputs, and GANs face challenges with training stability. The hybrid VAE-GAN models harness the strengths of both architectures to overcome these limitations, enhancing output quality and diversity. We provide a comprehensive overview of VAEs and GANs technology developments, their integration strategies, and resultant performance improvements. Applications across various fields, such as artistic creation, medical imaging, e-commerce, and video gaming, highlight the transformative potential of these models. However, challenges in model robustness, ethical concerns, and computational demands persist, posing significant hurdles. Future research directions are poised to transform the VAE-GAN landscape significantly. Enhancing training stability remains a priority, with new approaches such as incorporating self-correcting mechanisms into GANs training being tested. Addressing ethical issues is also critical, as policymakers and technologists work together to develop standards that prevent misuse. Moreover, reducing computational costs is fundamental to democratizing access to these technologies. Projects such as the development of MobileNetV2 have made strides in creating more efficient neural network architectures that maintain performance while being less resource-intensive. Further, the exploration of VAE-GAN applications in fields like augmented reality and personalized medicine offers exciting opportunities for growth, as evidenced by recent pilot studies.",

Traditional Intrusion Detection systems (IDS) often battles hard to identify latest piracy attempts owing to their dependence on pre-established patterns. To effectively address this we attempt to suggest innovative approach leveraging DL based Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and ML based Isolation Forest (IF) for detecting software piracies. Our proposed GAN-IF based cyber-security model performs its functions by training a Generator network to mimic the behavior of genuine software applications. Discriminator network discriminates between legitimate and pirated software. Isolation Forests assists in detecting anomalies in diverse conditions, including unseen attacks. Integrated training based on DL and ML framework enables efficient learning and adaptation with respect to piracy challenges, making it highly-successful against prior known threats. There are several DL models which are utilized in IDS operations having limitations in terms of robustness, interpretability. Utilizing GAN in the context of cyber-security to combat software-piracy can have noteworthy merits since GANs can precisely identify forged software as they are skilled at generating fake content resembling actual. Training a GAN on legitimate software, helps to learn and identify disparities in pirated versions. Isolation-Forest can detect anomalies in software distribution networks or user behavior with respect to software usage by recognizing abnormal patterns indicating software piracy, like illegal access or sharing of software licenses. Our proposed model combines GANs and Isolation Forests, excels at accurately detecting subtle indicators of software piracy, a capability that traditional methods may fail to recognize. ML-DL integrated model continuously learns and updates its detection capabilities in response to evolving piracy tactics, making it resilient against zero-day attacks, polymorphic malware. Through adversarial training, ml-model minimizes false alarms and focuses only on genuine threats. In our evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of GAN-IF based cyber-security model in detecting software piracy attempts across various scenarios. Results indicate that our approach outperforms traditional solutions in terms of detection accuracy and adaptability.",

The U-Net based GAN (U-Net GAN), a recently developed approach, can generate high-quality synthetic images by using a U-Net architecture for the discriminator. However, this model may suffer from severe mode collapse. In this study, a stable U-Net GAN (SUGAN) is proposed to mainly solve this problem. First, a gradient normalization module is introduced to the discriminator of U-Net GAN. This module effectively reduces gradient magnitudes, thereby greatly alleviating the problems of gradient instability and overfitting. As a result, the training stability of the GAN model is improved. Additionally, in order to solve the problem of blurred edges of the generated images, a modified residual network is used in the generator. This modification enhances its ability to capture image details, leading to higher-definition generated images. Extensive experiments conducted on several datasets show that the proposed SUGAN significantly improves over the Inception Score (IS) and Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) metrics compared with several state-of-the-art and classic GANs. The training process of our SUGAN is stable, and the quality and diversity of the generated samples are higher. This clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach for image generation tasks.

Moreover, in practice, discovering and flagging anomalies is very time-consuming and expensive. To solve this problem, unsupervised anomaly detection methods have often been used in the past, in which the model is trained with normal data to learn its behavioral patterns. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) can simulate complex and high-dimensional distributions of data and can be used to learn the behavioral patterns of normal data for unsupervised anomaly detection. However, because of the problem of convergence, GANs are difficult to train. Thus, USADs (an unsupervised anomaly detection model) utilize an autoencoder (AE) to undertake the task of the generator and discriminator and enhance the stability during adversarial training by using the AE to alleviate the problem of non-convergence encountered in GANs. Therefore, in this study, we used the USAD\u2019s generative adversarial training architecture combined with convolutional AEs to improve the model\u2019s feature extraction capabilities. In addition, to reduce false-positive outcomes caused by the prominent sharp points in the reconstructed data, we used the exponential weighted moving average method to smooth the reconstruction error, thereby improving the anomaly detection accuracy of the model. Finally, we experimented with real-world time-series data (ECG and 2D gesture) and verified that our approach could improve accuracy.

        "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are powerful machine learning models capable of generating fully synthetic samples of a desired phenomenon with a high resolution. Despite their success, the training process of a GAN is highly unstable, and typically, it is necessary to implement several accessory heuristics to the networks to reach acceptable convergence of the model. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to analyze the convergence and stability in the training of generative adversarial networks. For this purpose, we propose to decompose the objective function of the adversary min\u2013max game defining a periodic GAN into its Fourier series. By studying the dynamics of the truncated Fourier series for the continuous alternating gradient descend algorithm, we are able to approximate the real flow and to identify the main features of the convergence of GAN. This approach is confirmed empirically by studying the training flow in a 2-parametric GAN, aiming to generate an unknown exponential distribution. As a by-product, we show that convergent orbits in GANs are small perturbations of periodic orbits so the Nash equillibria are spiral attractors. This theoretically justifies the slow and unstable training observed in GANs.",

Data argumentation methods based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) have received widespread attention in solving this type of few-shot sample problem. However, the generated images suffer from various shortcomings, such as lack of diversity, low signal-to-noise ratio, blur, etc. In this article, the VAE-WGANGP is proposed, which combines GAN and variational autoencoder (VAE) to alleviate these shortcomings. The innovations of this paper are as follows: firstly, the generator of GAN is replaced with VAE, which constructs an asymmetric network ensuring the stability of GAN training; secondly, the asymmetric loss function is composed of four parts, including reconstruction loss, divergence loss, adversarial loss, and gradient penalty. In this way, the problem of gradient explosion or gradient disappearance is alleviated. The experimental results with the MSTAR dataset show that the images generated by the proposed model outperform the advanced technology with many similar deep features and achieve significant improvement in the target recognition accuracy rate.",

This paper investigates whether different normalization strategies and one-sided label smoothing can further stabilize the cGAN-based speech enhancement model.

Differently from previous distributed GANs training techniques, our approach avoids inter-process communications, reduces the risk of mode collapse and enhances scalability by using multiple generators, each one of them concurrently trained on a single data label. The use of the Wasserstein metric also reduces the risk of cycling by stabilizing the training of each generator. We illustrate the approach on the CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet1k datasets, three standard benchmark image datasets, maintaining the original resolution of the images for each dataset. Performance is assessed in terms of scalability and final accuracy within a limited fixed computational time and computational resources. To measure accuracy, we use the inception score, the Fr\u00e9chet inception distance, and image quality. An improvement in inception score and Fr\u00e9chet inception distance is shown in comparison to previous results obtained by performing the parallel approach on deep convolutional conditional generative adversarial neural networks as well as an improvement of image quality of the new images created by the GANs approach. Weak scaling is attained on both datasets using up to 2000 NVIDIA V100 GPUs on the OLCF supercomputer Summit.",

First, existing network anomaly detection and log analysis methods are often challenged by high-dimensional data and complex network topologies, resulting in unstable performance and high false-positive rates. In addition, traditional methods are usually difficult to handle time-series data, which is crucial for anomaly detection and log analysis. Therefore, we need a more efficient and accurate method to cope with these problems. To compensate for the shortcomings of current methods, we propose an innovative fusion model that integrates Isolation Forest, GAN (Generative Adversarial Network), and Transformer with each other, and each of them plays a unique role. Isolation Forest is used to quickly identify anomalous data points, and GAN is used to generate synthetic data with the real data distribution characteristics to augment the training dataset, while the Transformer is used for modeling and context extraction on time series data. The synergy of these three components makes our model more accurate and robust in anomaly detection and log analysis tasks. We validate the effectiveness of this fusion model in an extensive experimental evaluation. Experimental results show that our model significantly improves the accuracy of anomaly detection while reducing the false alarm rate, which helps to detect potential network problems in advance. The model also performs well in the log analysis task and is able to quickly identify anomalous behaviors, which helps to improve the stability of the system. The significance of this study is that it introduces advanced deep learning techniques, which work anomaly detection and log analysis.",

To address these issues, we introduce YOSO, a novel generative model designed for rapid, scalable, and high-fidelity one-step image synthesis with high training stability and mode coverage. Specifically, we smooth the adversarial divergence by the denoising generator itself, performing self-cooperative learning. We show that our method can serve as a one-step generation model training from scratch with competitive performance. Moreover, we extend our YOSO to one-step text-to-image generation based on pre-trained models by several effective training techniques (i.e., latent perceptual loss and latent discriminator for efficient training along with the latent DMs; the informative prior initialization (IPI), and the quick adaption stage for fixing the flawed noise scheduler). Experimental results show that YOSO achieves the state-of-the-art one-step generation performance even with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning. In particular, we show that the YOSO-PixArt-$\\alpha$ can generate images in one step trained on 512 resolution, with the capability of adapting to 1024 resolution without extra explicit training, requiring only ~10 A800 days for fine-tuning.

Methods Data were obtained from two distinct EEG datasets: a \u201chealthy\u201d set of 64-channel recordings collected during various motor/imagery tasks, and an \u201cunhealthy\u201d set of 18-channel recordings from individuals with orthopedic impairments. Both datasets underwent comprehensive preprocessing, including band-pass filtering (8\u201330 Hz), channel standardization, and artifact trimming. The training stage involved adversarial learning, in which a generator sought to reconstruct clean EEG signals while a discriminator (or critic in the case of WGAN-GP) attempted to distinguish between real and generated signals. The model evaluation was conducted using quantitative metrics such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), correlation coefficient, mutual information, and dynamic time warping (DTW) distance. Results Experimental findings indicate that adversarial learning substantially improves EEG signal fidelity across multiple quantitative metrics. Specifically, WGAN-GP achieved an SNR of up to 14.47 dB (compared to 12.37 dB for the standard GAN) and exhibited greater training stability, as evidenced by consistently lower relative root mean squared error (RRMSE) values. In contrast, the conventional GAN model excelled in preserving finer signal details, reflected in a PSNR of 19.28 dB and a correlation coefficient exceeding 0.90 in several recordings. Both adversarial frameworks outperformed classical wavelet-based thresholding and linear filtering methods, demonstrating superior adaptability to nonlinear distortions and dynamic interference patterns in EEG time-series data. Discussion By systematically comparing standard GAN and WGAN-GP architectures, this study highlights a practical trade-off between aggressive noise suppression and high-fidelity signal reconstruction. The demonstrated improvements in signal quality underscore the promise of adversarially trained models for applications ranging from basic neuroscience research to real-time brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCIs) in clinical or consumer-grade settings. The results further suggest that GAN-based frameworks can be easily scaled to next-generation wireless networks and complex electrophysiological datasets, offering robust and dynamic solutions to long-standing challenges in EEG denoising.",

The fabrication of dental restorations, however, remains challenging due to the complexity of the human masticatory system as well as the unique morphology of each individual dentition. Adaptation and reworking are frequently required during the insertion of fixed dental prostheses (FDPs), which increase cost and treatment time. This article proposes a data-driven approach for the partial reconstruction of occlusal surfaces based on a data set that comprises 92 3D mesh files of full dental crown restorations.\n\n\nMethods\nA Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is considered for the given task in view of its ability to represent extensive data sets in an unsupervised manner with a wide variety of applications. Having demonstrated good capabilities in terms of image quality and training stability, StyleGAN-2 has been chosen as the main network for generating the occlusal surfaces. A 2D projection method is proposed in order to generate 2D representations of the provided 3D tooth data set for integration with the StyleGAN architecture. The reconstruction capabilities of the trained network are demonstrated by means of 4 common inlay types using a Bayesian Image Reconstruction method. This involves pre-processing the data in order to extract the necessary information of the tooth preparations required for the used method as well as the modification of the initial reconstruction loss.\n\n\nResults\nThe reconstruction process yields satisfactory visual and quantitative results for all preparations with a root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 0.02 mm to 0.18 mm. When compared against a clinical procedure for CAD inlay fabrication, the group of dentists preferred the GAN-based restorations for 3 of the total 4 inlay geometries.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis article shows the effectiveness of the StyleGAN architecture with a downstream optimization process for the reconstruction of 4 different inlay geometries. The independence of the reconstruction process and the initial training of the GAN enables the application of the method for arbitrary inlay geometries without time-consuming retraining of the GAN.",

        "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) outperforms its peers in the generative models\u2019 family and is widely used to generate realistic samples in various domains. The basic idea of GAN is a competition between two networks called a generator and discriminator. Throughout the training process of GAN, the two networks face various challenges that affect the quality and diversity of the generated samples of GAN. These challenges include training instability and mode collapse problem. Training instability happens due to the variance of the performance between the generator and discriminator. The mode collapse, on the other hand, happens when the generator is stuck to generate diverse samples. One of the promising techniques that might overcome these issues and increase the networks\u2019 performance is transfer learning between discriminators as same as generators. In this regard, the contribution of this paper is fourfold. First, it proposes a novel approach called Collaborative-GAN based on transfer learning to mitigate the training instability and tackle the mode collapse issues. In the proposed approach, the well-performer network transfers its learned weights to the low-performer ones based on a periodical evaluation during the training process. Second, the paper proposes a novel method to evaluate the discriminators\u2019 performance based on a fuzzy inference system. Third, the paper proposes a method to evaluate the generators\u2019 performance based on a series of detected FID scores that measure the diversity of the generated samples every certain intervals during the training process. We apply the proposed approach on two different architectures of GAN, which we called Single-GAN and Dual-GANs. In Single-GAN, the weights are transferred between the identical networks within the same GAN model. In Dual-GANs, on the other hand, the weights are transferred between identical networks across different GAN models. Thus, the paper introduces two types of transfer learning for GANs; inter and intra-transfer learning based on the paradigm of GAN architecture as a fourth contribution. We validate the proposed approach on three different benchmarks representing CelebA, Cifar-10, and Fashion-Mnist. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art GAN models in terms of FID metric that measures the generated sample diversity. It is worth noting that the proposed approach achieved remarkable FID scores of 11.44, 24.19, and 11.21 on the Fashion-Mnist, Cifar-10, and CelebA datasets respectively.",

These networks train competitively, improving each other iteratively to produce increasingly realistic outputs.

Since its introduction in 2014 by Ian Goodfellow, GAN has evolved through various innovative architectures, including Vanilla GAN, Conditional GAN (cGAN), Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN), CycleGAN, StyleGAN, Wasserstein GAN (WGAN), and BigGAN. Each of these architectures presents a novel approach to address technical challenges such as training stability, data diversification, and result quality. GANs have been widely applied in various sectors. In healthcare, GANs are used to generate synthetic medical images that support diagnostic development without violating patient privacy. In the media and entertainment industry, GANs facilitate the enhancement of image and video resolution, as well as the creation of realistic content. However, the development of GANs faces challenges such as mode collapse, training instability, and inadequate quality evaluation. In addition to technical challenges, GANs raise ethical issues, such as the misuse of the technology for deepfake creation.

In decentralized environments, standalone GANs struggle with distributed data on client machines. Researchers have turned to federated learning (FL) for distributed-GAN (D-GAN) implementations, but efforts often fall short due to training instability and poor synchronization within GAN components. In this study, we present DRL-GAN, a lightweight Wasserstein conditional distributed relativistic loss-GAN designed to overcome existing limitations.

        "abstract": "Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs) represent a useful development in quantum machine learning, using the particular properties of quantum mechanics to solve the challenges of data analysis and modeling. This paper brings up a general analysis of five QGAN architectures, focusing on their evolution, strengths, weaknesses, and limitations in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Primary methods like Entangling Quantum GAN (EQ-GAN) and Quantum state fidelity (QuGAN) concentrate on stability, convergence, and robust performance on small-scale datasets such as 2 \u00d7 2 grayscale images. Intermediate models such as Image Quantum GAN (IQGAN) and Experimental Quantum GAN (EXQGAN) provide new ideas like trainable encoders and patch-based sub-generators that are scalable to 8 \u00d7 8 datasets with increasing noise resilience. The most advanced method is Parameterized Quantum Wasserstein GAN (PQWGAN), which uses a hybrid quantum-classical structure to obtain high-resolution image processing for 28 \u00d7 28 grayscale datasets while trying to maintain parameter efficiency. This study explores, analyzes, and summarizes critical problems of QGANs, including accuracy, convergence, parameter efficiency, image quality, performance metrics, and training stability under noisy conditions. In addition, developing QGANs can generate and train parameters in quantum approximation optimization algorithms. One of the useful applications of QGAN is generating medical datasets that can generate medical images from limited datasets to train specific medical models for the recognition of diseases.",

To address these challenges, this research proposes a novel deep learning framework that leverages generative adversarial networks (GANs) for data augmentation and transfer learning to enhance breast cancer classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The framework uses a two-stage augmentation approach. First, a conditional Wasserstein GAN (cWGAN) generates synthetic breast cancer images based on clinical data, enhancing training stability and enabling targeted feature incorporation. Second, traditional augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, flipping, cropping) are applied to both original and synthetic images. A multi-scale transfer learning technique is also employed, integrating three pre-trained CNNs (DenseNet-201, NasNetMobile, ResNet-101) with a multi-scale feature enrichment scheme, allowing the model to capture features at various scales. The framework was evaluated on the BreakHis dataset, achieving an accuracy of 99.2% for binary classification and 98.5% for multi-class classification, significantly outperforming existing methods. This framework offers a more efficient, cost-effective, and accurate approach for breast cancer diagnosis.

        "abstract": "Deep learning has played a vital role in advancing medical research, particularly in brain tumor segmentation. Despite using numerous deep learning algorithms for this purpose, accurately and reliably segmenting brain tumors remains a significant challenge. Segmentation of precise tumors is essential for the effective treatment of brain diseases. While deep learning offers a range of algorithms for segmentation, they still face limitations when analyzing medical images due to the variations in tumor shape, size, and location. This study proposes a deep learning approach combining a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with transfer learning and auto-encoder techniques to enhance brain tumor segmentation. The GAN incorporates a generator and discriminator to generate superior segmentation outcomes. In the generator, we applied downsampling and upsampling for tumor segmentation. In addition, an auto-encoder is applied in which the encoder retains as much information as possible and then the decoder with those encodings reconstructs the image. The transfer learning technique is applied at the bottleneck using the DenseNet model. Combining auto-encoder techniques with transfer learning methodologies in GANs feature learning is enhanced, training time is reduced, and stability is increased. In this work, we enhanced the accuracy of brain tumor segmentation and even achieved better results for tumors having small sizes. We train and evaluate our proposed model using the publicly available BraTS 2021 dataset. The experimental result shows a dice score of 0.94 for the whole tumor, 0.86 for the tumor core, and 0.82 for the enhancing tumor. It is also shown that we achieve 2% to 4% higher accuracy than other methods.",

Our research introduces a novel deep learning framework for melanoma classification, trained and validated using the extensive SIIM\u2010ISIC Melanoma Classification Challenge\u2010ISIC\u20102020 dataset. The framework features three dilated convolution layers that extract critical feature vectors for classification. A key aspect of our model is incorporating the Off\u2010policy Proximal Policy Optimization (Off\u2010policy PPO) algorithm, which effectively handles data imbalance in the training set by rewarding the accurate classification of underrepresented samples. In this framework, the model is visualized as an agent making a series of decisions, where each sample represents a distinct state. Additionally, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) augments training data to improve generalizability, paired with a new regularization technique to stabilize GAN training and prevent mode collapse. The model achieved an F\u2010measure of 91.836% and a geometric mean of 91.920%, surpassing existing models and demonstrating the model's practical utility in clinical environments.

        "abstract": "Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) has a role in characterising tissue intraoperatively to guide tumour resection during surgery. To capture good quality pCLE data which is important for diagnosis, the probe-tissue contact needs to be maintained within a working range of micrometre scale. This can be achieved through micro-surgical robotic manipulation which requires the automatic estimation of the probe-tissue distance. In this paper, we propose a novel deep regression framework composed of the Deep Regression Generative Adversarial Network (DR-GAN) and a Sequence Attention (SA) module. The aim of DR-GAN is to train the network using an enhanced image-based supervision approach. It extents the standard generator by using a well-defined function for image generation, instead of a learnable decoder. Also, DR-GAN uses a novel learnable neural perceptual loss which combines for the first time spatial and frequency domain features. This effectively suppresses the adverse effects of noise in the pCLE data. To incorporate temporal information, we\u2019ve designed the SA module which is a cross-attention module, enhanced with Radial Basis Function based encoding (SA-RBF). Furthermore, to train the regression framework, we designed a multi-step training mechanism. During inference, the trained network is used to generate data representations which are fused along time in the SA-RBF module to boost the regression stability. Our proposed network advances SOTA networks by addressing the challenge of excessive noise in the pCLE data and enhancing regression stability. It outperforms SOTA networks applied on the pCLE Regression dataset (PRD) in terms of accuracy, data quality and stability.",

A significant challenge in these areas is the limited availability of high-quality datasets, which can hinder the accuracy of the predictive models. To address this issue, this paper proposes leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic samples for training. Despite their potential, traditional GAN face challenges such as mode collapse, vanishing gradients, and pixel integrity issues. This paper introduces a novel architecture, Penca-GAN, which enhances GANs through three key modifications: (1) dual loss functions to ensure pixel integrity and promote diversity in augmented images, effectively mitigating mode collapse and improving the quality of synthetic data; (2) the integration of an identity block to stabilize training, preserving essential input features and facilitating smoother gradient flow; and (3) a pancreas-inspired metaheuristic loss function that dynamically adapts to variations in training data to maintain pixel coherence and diversity. Extensive experiments on three renewable energy datasets\u2014SKY images, Solar images, and Wind Turbine images\u2014demonstrate the effectiveness of the Penca-GAN architecture. Our comparative analysis revealed that Penca-GAN consistently achieved the lowest Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) scores (164.45 for SKY, 113.54 for Solar, and 109.34 for Wind Turbine), indicating superior image quality compared to other architectures. Additionally, it attains the highest Inception Score (IS) across all datasets, scoring 71.43 for SKY, 87.65 for Solar, and 90.32 for Wind Turbine. Furthermore, the application of Penca-GAN significantly enhanced the fault detection capabilities, achieving accuracy improvements from 85.92 to 90.04% for solar panels and from 86.06 to 90.43% for wind turbines. These results underscore Penca-GAN\u2019s robust performance in generating high-fidelity synthetic images, significantly advancing renewable energy applications, and improving model performance in critical tasks such as fault detection and energy prediction.",

Hence, fast and accurate anomaly detection (AD) has become an urgent need via the edge computing of the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). For this purpose, this article creatively proposes a dual agents based on two-phase adversarial training strategy [two-phase dual-adversarial agents (2P-DAs)] to perform rapid, stable, and unsupervised AD for large-scale IIoT-edge devices. It integrates the superiorities of deep autoencoder (AEs) and generative adversarial network (GAN), utilizing normal multivariate time-series as inputs, 1-Encoder vs. 2-Decoders architecture as backbone, and two-phase unsupervised adversarial learning to make it isolate anomalies while providing efficient training. On the one hand, this allows the inherent limitations of AEs to be overcome by training a model capable for recognizing nonanomalies and thus performing a good reconstruction. On the other hand, dual structures allow for stability in adversarial training, thereby solving the issues of collapse and nonconvergence encountered in GANs. Two practical industrial data, as cloud and edge data, are used to verify the robustness, inference speed and high detection performance of 2P-DAs in IIoT-edge AD, which demonstrates an impressive performance under multiple evaluation indexes.",

WAT, essential for monitoring process stability and cost control, and Chip Probing (CP) testing, which assesses the functionality of each Die on a wafer, are integral to ensuring product quality. However, the yield data, indicating the proportion of functional chips post-CP testing, often suffer from data imbalance, skewing machine learning predictions towards the majority class and reducing model accuracy. To overcome this, the study leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to generate balanced samples by creating minority class samples for model training. This approach not only mitigates the costs associated with CP testing but also facilitates early fault detection in wafer manufacturing. Through extensive experimentation with real in-dustrial WAT and yield data, the proposed method demonstrates a significant improvement in model performance, enhancing it by approximately 7% and achieving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of over 0.95. Additionally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) model is employed within the framework to rapidly analyze and identify faults impacting yield, further contributing to the efficiency of semiconductor production processes.",
