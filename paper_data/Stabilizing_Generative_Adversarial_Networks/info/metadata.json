The key idea is to grow both the generator and discriminator progressively: starting from a low resolution, we add new layers that model increasingly fine details as training progresses. This both speeds the training up and greatly stabilizes it, allowing us to produce images of unprecedented quality, e.g., CelebA images at 1024^2. We also propose a simple way to increase the variation in generated images, and achieve a record inception score of 8.80 in unsupervised CIFAR10. Additionally, we describe several implementation details that are important for discouraging unhealthy competition between the generator and discriminator. Finally, we suggest a new metric for evaluating GAN results, both in terms of image quality and variation. As an additional contribution, we construct a higher-quality version of the CelebA dataset.",

We decompose the hard problem into more manageable sub-problems through a sketch-refinement process. The Stage-I GAN sketches the primitive shape and colors of the object based on the given text description, yielding Stage-I low-resolution images. The Stage-II GAN takes Stage-I results and text descriptions as inputs, and generates high-resolution images with photo-realistic details. It is able to rectify defects in Stage-I results and add compelling details with the refinement process. To improve the diversity of the synthesized images and stabilize the training of the conditional-GAN, we introduce a novel Conditioning Augmentation technique that encourages smoothness in the latent conditioning manifold. Extensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-arts on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant improvements on generating photo-realistic images conditioned on text descriptions.",

Previous attempts to directly augment the training data manipulate the distribution of real images, yielding little benefit; DiffAugment enables us to adopt the differentiable augmentation for the generated samples, effectively stabilizes training, and leads to better convergence. Experiments demonstrate consistent gains of our method over a variety of GAN architectures and loss functions for both unconditional and class-conditional generation.

Unlike standard GANs relying only on data for training, here we encoded into the architecture of GANs the governing physical laws in the form of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) using automatic differentiation. In particular, we applied Wasserstein GANs with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) for its enhanced stability compared to vanilla GANs. We first tested WGAN-GP in approximating Gaussian processes of different correlation lengths based on data realizations collected from simultaneous reads at sparsely placed sensors. We obtained good approximation of the generated stochastic processes to the target ones even for a mismatch between the input noise dimensionality and the effective dimensionality of the target stochastic processes. We also studied the overfitting issue for both the discriminator and generator, and we found that overfitting occurs also in the generator in addition to the discriminator as previously reported. Subsequently, we considered the solution of elliptic SDEs requiring approximations of three stochastic processes, namely the solution, the forcing, and the diffusion coefficient. We used three generators for the PI-GANs, two of them were feed forward deep neural networks (DNNs) while the other one was the neural network induced by the SDE. Depending on the data, we employed one or multiple feed forward DNNs as the discriminators in PI-GANs. Here, we have demonstrated the accuracy and effectiveness of PI-GANs in solving SDEs for up to 30 dimensions, but in principle, PI-GANs could tackle very high dimensional problems given more sensor data with low-polynomial growth in computational cost.",

Meanwhile, as the rolling bearing works in the normal state at most times, it is easy to raise the imbalance problem of fault types which restricts the diagnosis accuracy and stability. To solve these problems, we present an imbalanced fault diagnosis method based on the generative adversarial network (GAN) and provide a comparative study in detail. The key idea is utilizing GAN, a kind of deep learning technique, to generate synthetic samples for minority fault class and then improve the generalization ability of the fault diagnosis model. First, this method applies fast Fourier transform to pre-process the original vibration signal and then obtains the frequency spectrum of fault samples. Second, it uses the spectrum data as the input of GAN to generate the synthetic minority samples following the data distribution of the real samples. Finally, it puts the synthetic samples into the training set and builds a stacked denoising auto encoder model for fault diagnosis. To testify the effectiveness of the proposed method, a series of comparative experiments is carried out on the CWRU bearing dataset. The results show that the proposed method can provide a better solution for imbalanced fault diagnosis on the basis of generating similar fault samples. As a comparative study, the proposed method is compared to several diagnostic methods with traditional time-frequency domain characteristics.

For evaluation we consider and compare different metrics such as Inception score, Frechet inception distance and sliced Wasserstein distance, together showing that our EEG-GAN framework generated naturalistic EEG examples. It thus opens up a range of new generative application scenarios in the neuroscientific and neurological context, such as data augmentation in brain-computer interfacing tasks, EEG super-sampling, or restoration of corrupted data segments.

Arguably their most significant impact has been in the area of computer vision where great advances have been made in challenges such as plausible image generation, image-to-image translation, facial attribute manipulation, and similar domains. Despite the significant successes achieved to date, applying GANs to real-world problems still poses significant challenges, three of which we focus on here. These are as follows: (1) the generation of high quality images, (2) diversity of image generation, and (3) stabilizing training. Focusing on the degree to which popular GAN technologies have made progress against these challenges, we provide a detailed review of the state-of-the-art in GAN-related research in the published scientific literature. We further structure this review through a convenient taxonomy we have adopted based on variations in GAN architectures and loss functions. While several reviews for GANs have been presented to date, none have considered the status of this field based on their progress toward addressing practical challenges relevant to computer vision. Accordingly, we review and critically discuss the most popular architecture-variant, and loss-variant GANs, for tackling these challenges. Our objective is to provide an overview as well as a critical analysis of the status of GAN research in terms of relevant progress toward critical computer vision application requirements. As we do this we also discuss the most compelling applications in computer vision in which GANs have demonstrated considerable success along with some suggestions for future research directions.

On the one hand, this interaction term explains the origin of the slow-down effect in the convergence of Simultaneous Gradient Ascent (SGA) to stable Nash equilibria. On the other hand, for the unstable equilibria, exponential convergence can be proved thanks to the interaction term, for three modified dynamics which have been proposed to stabilize GAN training: Optimistic Mirror Descent (OMD), Consensus Optimization (CO) and Predictive Method (PM).

Inspired by the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) to image-to-image task, we propose a novel FuseGAN to fulfill the images-to-image for multi-focus image fusion. To satisfy the requirement of dual input-to-one output, the encoder of the generator in FuseGAN is designed as a Siamese network. The least square GAN objective is employed to enhance the training stability of FuseGAN, resulting in an accurate confidence map for focus region detection. Also, we exploit the convolutional conditional random fields technique on the confidence map to reach a refined final decision map for better focus region detection. Moreover, due to the lack of a large-scale standard dataset, we synthesize a large enough multi-focus image dataset based on a public natural image dataset PASCAL VOC 2012, where we utilize a normalized disk point spread function to simulate the defocus and separate the background and foreground in the synthesis for each image. We conduct extensive experiments on two public datasets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results demonstrate that the proposed method presents accurate decision maps for focus regions in multi-focus images, such that the fused images are superior to 11 recent state-of-the-art algorithms, not only in visual perception, but also in quantitative analysis in terms of five metrics.",

Focusing on the lack of training images of grape leaf diseases, this paper proposes a novel model named Leaf GAN, which is based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), to generate images of four different grape leaf diseases for training identification models. A generator model with degressive channels is first designed to generate grape leaf disease images; then, the dense connectivity strategy and instance normalization are fused into an efficient discriminator to identify real and fake disease images by utilizing their excellent feature extraction capability on grape leaf lesions. Finally, the deep regret gradient penalty method is applied to stabilize the training process of the model. Using a total of 4,062 grape leaf disease images, the Leaf GAN model ultimately generates 8,124 grape leaf disease images. The generated grape leaf disease images based on Leaf GAN model can obtain better performance than DCGAN and WGAN in terms of the Fr\u00e9chet inception distance. The experimental results show that the proposed Leaf GAN model generates sufficient grape leaf disease images with prominent lesions, providing a feasible solution for the data augmentation of grape leaf disease images. For the eight prevailing classification models with the expanded dataset, the identification performance based on CNNs indicated higher accuracies, whereby all the accuracies were better than those of the initial dataset with other data augmentation methods. Among them, Xception achieves a recognition accuracy of 98.70% on the testing set. The results demonstrate that the proposed data augmentation method represents a new approach to overcoming the overfitting problem in disease identification and can effectively improve the identification accuracy.",

We introduce a method for training GANs with discrete data that uses the estimated difference measure from the discriminator to compute importance weights for generated samples, thus providing a policy gradient for training the generator. The importance weights have a strong connection to the decision boundary of the discriminator, and we call our method boundary-seeking GANs (BGANs).

However, emerging CPS fields suffer from imbalanced and missing sample data, which makes the training of IDS difficult. In this paper, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) based intrusion detection system (G-IDS), where GAN generates synthetic samples, and IDS gets trained on them along with the original ones. G-IDS also fixes the difficulties of imbalanced or missing data problems. We model a network security dataset for an emerging CPS using NSL KDD-99 dataset and evaluate our proposed model's performance using different metrics.

For evaluating the image quality, we conduct both qualitative and quantitative experiments, and the experimental results show that LSGANs can generate higher quality images than regular GANs. Furthermore, we evaluate the stability of LSGANs in two groups. One is to compare between LSGANs and regular GANs without gradient penalty. We conduct three experiments, including Gaussian mixture distribution, difficult architectures, and a newly proposed method \u2014 datasets with small variability, to illustrate the stability of LSGANs. The other one is to compare between LSGANs with gradient penalty (LSGANs-GP) and WGANs with gradient penalty (WGANs-GP).

Machine learning (ML) has been applied for tasks that are important for smart grid operation including energy consumption and generation forecasting, anomaly detection, and state estimation. These ML solutions commonly require sufficient historical data; however, this data is often not readily available because of reasons such as data collection costs and concerns regarding security and privacy. This paper introduces a recurrent generative adversarial network (R-GAN) for generating realistic energy consumption data by learning from real data. Generativea adversarial networks (GANs) have been mostly used for image tasks (e.g., image generation, super-resolution), but here they are used with time series data. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) from image GANs are replaced with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) because of RNN\u2019s ability to capture temporal dependencies. To improve training stability and increase quality of generated data, Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) and Metropolis-Hastings GAN (MH-GAN) approaches were applied. The accuracy is further improved by adding features created with ARIMA and Fourier transform. Experiments demonstrate that data generated by R-GAN can be used for training energy forecasting models.",

We show that the Lipschitz constant of these generative networks has to be large in order to fit multimodal distributions. More precisely, we show that the total variation distance and the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the generated and the data distribution are bounded from below by a constant depending on the mode separation and the Lipschitz constant. Since constraining the Lipschitz constants of neural networks is a common way to stabilize generative models, there is a provable trade-off between the ability of push-forward models to approximate multimodal distributions and the stability of their training. We validate our findings on one-dimensional and image datasets and empirically show that generative models consisting of stacked networks with stochastic input at each step, such as diffusion models do not suffer of such limitations.",

In this work, we propose a principled framework to simultaneously mitigate two fundamental issues in GANs: catastrophic forgetting of the discriminator and mode collapse of the generator. We achieve this by employing for GANs a contrastive learning and mutual information maximization approach, and perform extensive analyses to understand sources of improvements. Our approach significantly stabilizes GAN training and improves GAN performance for image synthesis across five datasets under the same training and evaluation conditions against state-of-the-art works. In particular, compared to the state-of-the-art SSGAN, our approach does not suffer from poorer performance on image domains such as faces, and instead improves performance significantly. Our approach is simple to implement and practical: it involves only one auxiliary objective, has low computational cost, and performs robustly across a wide range of training settings and datasets without any hyperparameter tuning. For reproducibility, our code is available in the open-source GAN library, Mimicry [34].",

Since generative adversarial nets (GANs) have shown competitive results on general text generation, they are extended for category text generation in some previous works. However, the complicated model structures and learning strategies limit their performance and exacerbate the training instability. This paper proposes a category-aware GAN (CatGAN) which consists of an efficient category-aware model for category text generation and a hierarchical evolutionary learning algorithm for training our model. The category-aware model directly measures the gap between real samples and generated samples on each category, then reducing this gap will guide the model to generate high-quality category samples. The Gumbel-Softmax relaxation further frees our model from complicated learning strategies for updating CatGAN on discrete data. Moreover, only focusing on the sample quality normally leads the mode collapse problem, thus a hierarchical evolutionary learning algorithm is introduced to stabilize the training procedure and obtain the trade-off between quality and diversity while training CatGAN. Experimental results demonstrate that CatGAN outperforms most of the existing state-of-the-art methods.",

We notice that the distributions of real and generated data should match even when they undergo the same filtering. Therefore, to address the limited support problem we propose to train GANs by using different filtered versions of the real and generated data distributions. In this way, filtering does not prevent the exact matching of the data distribution, while helping training by extending the support of both distributions. As filtering we consider adding samples from an arbitrary distribution to the data, which corresponds to a convolution of the data distribution with the arbitrary one. We also propose to learn the generation of these samples so as to challenge the discriminator in the adversarial training. We show that our approach results in a stable and well-behaved training of even the original minimax GAN formulation. Moreover, our technique can be incorporated in most modern GAN formulations and leads to a consistent improvement on several common datasets.",

However GANs are known to be very hard to train, suffering from problems such as mode collapse and disturbing visual artifacts. Batch normalization (BN) techniques have been introduced to address the training. Though BN accelerates the training in the beginning, our experiments show that the use of BN can be unstable and negatively impact the quality of the trained model. The evaluation of BN and numerous other recent schemes for improving GAN training is hindered by the lack of an effective objective quality measure for GAN models. To address these issues, we first introduce a weight normalization (WN) approach for GAN training that significantly improves the stability, efficiency and the quality of the generated samples. To allow a methodical evaluation, we introduce squared Euclidean reconstruction error on a test set as a new objective measure, to assess training performance in terms of speed, stability, and quality of generated samples. Our experiments with a standard DCGAN architecture on commonly used datasets (CelebA, LSUN bedroom, and CIFAR-10) indicate that training using WN is generally superior to BN for GANs, achieving 10% lower mean squared loss for reconstruction and significantly better qualitative results than BN. We further demonstrate the stability of WN on a 21-layer ResNet trained with the CelebA data set. The code for this paper is available at this https URL",

However, GANs are limited in two ways. They often learn distributions with low support---a phenomenon known as mode collapse---and they do not guarantee the existence of a probability density, which makes evaluating generalization using predictive log-likelihood impossible. In this paper, we develop the prescribed GAN (PresGAN) to address these shortcomings. PresGANs add noise to the output of a density network and optimize an entropy-regularized adversarial loss. The added noise renders tractable approximations of the predictive log-likelihood and stabilizes the training procedure. The entropy regularizer encourages PresGANs to capture all the modes of the data distribution. Fitting PresGANs involves computing the intractable gradients of the entropy regularization term; PresGANs sidestep this intractability using unbiased stochastic estimates. We evaluate PresGANs on several datasets and found they mitigate mode collapse and generate samples with high perceptual quality. We further found that PresGANs reduce the gap in performance in terms of predictive log-likelihood between traditional GANs and variational autoencoders (VAEs).",

By artificially generating fake samples, the proposed method can mitigate the loss caused by the lack of real fault data.

Moreover, the network interpolation utilizes the models in both stages and reduces undesirable noise and artifacts, while maintaining important edges.

However, their training requires the availability of large-scale accurate class-labeled data, which are often laborious or impractical to collect in a real-world scenario. To remedy this, we propose a novel family of GANs called label-noise robust GANs (rGANs), which, by incorporating a noise transition model, can learn a clean label conditional generative distribution even when training labels are noisy. In particular, we propose two variants: rAC-GAN, which is a bridging model between AC-GAN and the label-noise robust classification model, and rcGAN, which is an extension of cGAN and solves this problem with no reliance on any classifier. In addition to providing the theoretical background, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our models through extensive experiments using diverse GAN configurations, various noise settings, and multiple evaluation metrics (in which we tested 402 conditions in total).",

The outstanding results achieved by deep learning techniques in developing such applications have improved the diagnostic accuracy. Nevertheless, the performance of these models is heavily dependent on the volume of labelled data used for training, which is unfortunately not available. To address this problem, traditional data augmentation is usually adopted. Recently, the emergence of a generative adversarial network (GAN) seems a more plausible solution, where synthetic images are generated. In this work, we have developed a deep generative adversarial network (DGAN) multi-class classifier, which can generate skin problem images by learning the true data distribution from the available images. Unlike the usual two-class classifier, we have developed a multi-class solution, and to address the class-imbalanced dataset, we have taken images from different datasets available online. One main challenge faced during our development is mainly to improve the stability of the DGAN model during the training phase. To analyse the performance of GAN, we have developed two CNN models in parallel based on the architecture of ResNet50 and VGG16 by augmenting the training datasets using the traditional rotation, flipping, and scaling methods. We have used both labelled and unlabelled data for testing to test the models. DGAN has outperformed the conventional data augmentation by achieving a performance of 91.1% for the unlabelled dataset and 92.3% for the labelled dataset. On the contrary, CNN models with data augmentation have achieved a performance of up to 70.8% for the unlabelled dataset. The outcome of our DGAN confirms the ability of the model to learn from unlabelled datasets and yet produce a good diagnosis result.",

In particular, different objective functions are used in the generator of a GAN as variation operators. This helps train the generator with various candidate architectures and their associated weights to play adversarial training against the discriminator of the GAN. Following evaluations by the discriminator, superior candidate generators survive to the next generation and evolve for potentially better architectures and their weights simultaneously, leading to more stabilized GANs with improved performance.

In spite of this success, they gained a reputation for being difficult to train, what results in a time-consuming and human-involved development process to use them. We consider an alternative training process, named SGAN, in which several adversarial \"local\" pairs of networks are trained independently so that a \"global\" supervising pair of networks can be trained against them. The goal is to train the global pair with the corresponding ensemble opponent for improved performances in terms of mode coverage. This approach aims at increasing the chances that learning will not stop for the global pair, preventing both to be trapped in an unsatisfactory local minimum, or to face oscillations often observed in practice. To guarantee the latter, the global pair never affects the local ones. The rules of SGAN training are thus as follows: the global generator and discriminator are trained using the local discriminators and generators, respectively, whereas the local networks are trained with their fixed local opponent. Experimental results on both toy and real-world problems demonstrate that this approach outperforms standard training in terms of better mitigating mode collapse, stability while converging and that it surprisingly, increases the convergence speed as well.",

However, training instability is still one of the open problems for all GAN-based algorithms. Quite a number of methods have been proposed to stabilize the training of GANs, the focuses of which were respectively put on the loss functions, regularization and normalization technologies, training algorithms, and model architectures. Different from the above methods, in this paper, a new perspective on stabilizing GANs training is presented. It is found that sometimes the images produced by the generator act like adversarial examples of the discriminator during the training process, which may be part of the reason causing the unstable training of GANs. With this finding, we propose the Direct Adversarial Training (DAT) method to stabilize the training process of GANs. Furthermore, we prove that the DAT method is able to minimize the Lipschitz constant of the discriminator adaptively. The advanced performance of DAT is verified on multiple loss functions, network architectures, hyper-parameters, and datasets. Specifically, DAT achieves significant improvements of 11.5% FID on CIFAR-100 unconditional generation based on SSGAN, 10.5% FID on STL-10 unconditional generation based on SSGAN, and 13.2% FID on LSUN-Bedroom unconditional generation based on SSGAN.",

        "abstract": "In conventional ultrasound (US) imaging, it is common to transmit several focused beams at multiple locations to generate a multi-focus image with constant lateral resolution throughout the image. However, this method comes at the expense of a loss in temporal resolution, which is important in applications requiring both high-frame rate and constant lateral resolution. Moreover, relative motions of the target with respect to the probe often exist due to hand tremors or biological motions, causing blurring artifacts in the multi-focus image. This article introduces a novel approach for multi-focus US image recovery based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) without a reduction in the frame-rate. Herein, a mapping function between the single-focus US image and multi-focus version for having a constant lateral resolution everywhere is estimated through different GANs. We use adversarial loss functions in addition to Mean Square Error (MSE) to generate more realistic ultrasound images. Moreover, we use the boundary seeking method for improving the stability of training, which is currently the main challenge in using GANs. Experiments on simulated and real phantoms as well as on ex vivo data are performed. Results confirm that having both adversarial loss function and boundary seeking training provides better results in terms of the mean opinion score test. Furthermore, the proposed method enhances the resolution and contrast indexes without sacrificing the frame-rate. As for the comparison with other approaches which are not based on NNs, the proposed approach gives similar results while requiring neither channel data nor computationally expensive algorithms.",

For training-based channel estimations, increasing the length of a training sequence may improve the accuracy of channel estimation but causes a higher overhead. Nevertheless, this paper shows that benefiting from generative adversarial networks (GANs), which is an emerging deep learning framework, the accuracy of channel estimation can be improved without transmitting a longer training sequence. To this end, this paper proposes a GAN-based channel estimation enhancement algorithm, where GANs are trained online with receive sequence so as to obtain a longer mimic sequence and enhance channel estimation. In order to address the problem of improving the training stability and the learning ability of GANs, this paper proposes a novel framework by integrating a conditional GAN with an improved Wasserstein GAN. Furthermore, a strategy based on a lookup table is proposed to alleviate overfitting that may occur during the training of GANs. Simulation results indicate that the proposed GAN-based channel estimation enhancement algorithm can benefit the conventional training-based channel estimation, yielding lower relative error performance, especially in the low SNR regions.",

However, in practical engineering application scenarios, mechanical equipment is usually in a normal state, and small and imbalanced (S & I) fault samples are common, which seriously reduces the accuracy and stability of the fault diagnosis model. To solve this problem, an auxiliary classifier generative adversarial network with spectral normalization (ACGAN-SN) is proposed in this paper. First, a generation module based on a deconvolution layer is built to generate false data from Gaussian noise. Second, to enhance the training stability of the model, the data label information is used to make label constraints on the generated fake data under the basic GAN framework. Spectral normalization constraints are imposed on the output of each layer of the neural network of the discriminator to realize the Lipschitz continuity condition so as to avoid vanishing or exploding gradients. Finally, based on the generated data and the original S & I dataset, seven kinds of bearing fault datasets are made, and the prediction results of the Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model is verified. The results show that the data generated by ACGAN-SN can significantly promote the performance of the fault diagnosis model under the S & I fault samples.",

Focusing on the fact that standard GAN minimizes reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, we transfer the representative feature, which is extracted from the data distribution using a pre-trained autoencoder (AE), to the discriminator of standard GANs.

In this article, we propose to stabilize GAN training via a novel particle-based variational inference\u2014Langevin Stein variational gradient descent (LSVGD), which not only inherits the flexibility and efficiency of original SVGD but also aims to address its instability issues by incorporating an extra disturbance into the update dynamics. We further demonstrate that, by properly adjusting the noise variance, LSVGD simulates a Langevin process whose stationary distribution is exactly the target distribution.

The normal GANs are supposed to minimize the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence between distributions of natural and generated images. In this paper, we propose the Alpha-divergence Generative Adversarial Net (Alpha-GAN) which adopts the alpha divergence as the minimization objective function of generators. The alpha divergence can be regarded as a generalization of the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence, Pearson \u03c72 divergence, Hellinger divergence, etc. Our Alpha-GAN employs the power function as the form of adversarial loss for the discriminator with two-order indexes. These hyper-parameters make our model more flexible to trade off between the generated and target distributions. We further give a theoretical analysis of how to select these hyper-parameters to balance the training stability and the quality of generated images. Extensive experiments of Alpha-GAN are performed on SVHN and CelebA datasets, and evaluation results show the stability of Alpha-GAN. The generated samples are also competitive compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.",

The adversarial training paradigm has been proposed to stabilize generative methods, and has proven to be highly successful \u2013 though by no means from the first attempt. This chapter gives a basic introduction into the motivation for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and traces the path of their success by abstracting the basic task and working mechanism, and deriving the difficulty of early practical approaches. Methods for a more stable training will be shown, and also typical signs for poor convergence and their reasons. Though this chapter focuses on GANs that are meant for image generation and image analysis, the adversarial training paradigm itself is not specific to images, and also generalizes to tasks in image analysis. Examples of architectures for image semantic segmentation and abnormality detection will be acclaimed, before contrasting GANs with further generative modeling approaches lately entering the scene. This will allow a contextualized view on the limits but also benefits of GANs.",

However, PET imaging can be prohibitive in terms of cost and planning, and is also among the imaging techniques with the highest dosage of radiation. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), in contrast, is more widely available and provides more flexibility when setting the desired image resolution. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of AD using MRI is difficult due to the very subtle physiological differences between healthy and AD subjects visible on MRI. As a result, many attempts have been made to synthesize PET images from MR images using generative adversarial networks (GANs) in the interest of enabling the diagnosis of AD from MR. Existing work on PET synthesis from MRI has largely focused on Conditional GANs, where MR images are used to generate PET images and subsequently used for AD diagnosis. There is no end-to-end training goal. This paper proposes an alternative approach to the aforementioned, where AD diagnosis is incorporated in the GAN training objective to achieve the best AD classification performance. Different GAN lossesare fine-tuned based on the discriminator performance, and the overall training is stabilized. The proposed network architecture and training regime show state-of-the-art performance for three- and four- class AD classification tasks.",

However, non-standardized imaging pro-tocols are commonplace, which poses a fundamental challenge in large-scale cross-center CT image analysis. One approach to address the problem is to standardize CT images using generative adversarial network models (GAN). GAN learns the data distribution of training images and generate synthesized images under the same distribution. However, existing GAN models are not directly applicable to this task mainly due to the lack of constraints on the mode of data to generate. Furthermore, they treat every image equally, but in real applications, some images are more difficult to standardize than the others. All these may lead to the lack-of-detail problem in CT image synthesis. We present a new GAN model called GANai to mitigate the differences in radiomic features across CT images captured using non-standard imaging protocols. Given source images, GANai composes new images by specifying a high-level goal that the image features of the synthesized images should be similar to those of the standard images. GANai introduces an alternative improvement training strategy to alternatively and steadily improve model performance. The new training strategy enables a series of technical improvements, including phase-specific loss functions, phase-specific training data, and the adoption of ensemble learning, leading to better model performance. The experimental results show that GANai is significantly better than the existing state-of-the-art image synthesis algorithms on CT image standardization. Also, it significantly improves the efficiency and stability of GAN model training.",

During the training process, the discriminator will play against multiple generators simultaneously, where each generator adopts a different objective function as a mutation operation. Every time after the specified number of training iterations, the generator individuals will be evaluated and the best performing generator offspring will be retained for the next round of evolution. Based on this, the generator can continuously adjust the training strategy during training, and the self-attention module also enables the model to obtain the modeling ability of long-range dependencies.

However, these architectures leave limited control over shaping the output of the network. This paper explores a conditional extension to the StyleGAN architecture with the aim of firstly, improving on the low resolution results of previous research and, secondly, increasing the controllability of the output through the use of synthetic class-conditions. Furthermore, methods of extracting such class conditions are explored, where the challenge lies in the fact that, visual logo characteristics are hard to define. The introduced conditional style-based generator architecture is trained on the extracted class-conditions in two experiments and studied relative to the performance of an unconditional model. Results show that, whilst the unconditional model more closely matches the training distribution, high quality conditions enabled the embedding of finer details onto the latent space, leading to more diverse output.",

A possible explanation for training instabilities is the inherent imbalance between the networks: While the discriminator is trained directly on both real and fake samples, the generator only has control over the fake samples it produces since the real data distribution is fixed by the choice of a given dataset. We propose a simple modification that gives the generator control over the real samples which leads to a tempered learning process for both generator and discriminator. The real data distribution passes through a lens before being revealed to the discriminator, balancing the generator and discriminator by gradually revealing more detailed features necessary to produce high-quality results. The proposed module automatically adjusts the learning process to the current strength of the networks, yet is generic and easy to add to any GAN variant. In a number of experiments, we show that this can improve quality, stability and/or convergence speed across a range of different GAN architectures (DCGAN, LSGAN, WGAN-GP).",

The purpose is to annex the generated data with the original train set for adversarial training to improve the detection performance of machine learning (ML) classifiers. The quality of generated adversarial samples relies on the adequacy of training data samples. However, in low data regimes like medical diagnostic imaging and cybersecurity, the anomaly samples are scarce in number. This paper proposes a novel GAN design called evasion generative adversarial network (EVAGAN) that is more suitable for low data regime problems that use oversampling for detection improvement of ML classifiers. EVAGAN not only can generate evasion samples but its discriminator can act as an evasion-aware classifier. We have considered auxiliary classifier GAN (ACGAN) as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of EVAGAN on cybersecurity (ISCX-2014, CIC-2017, and CIC2018) botnet and computer vision (MNIST) datasets. We demonstrate that EVAGAN outperforms ACGAN for unbalanced datasets with respect to detection performance, training stability, and time complexity. EVAGAN's generator quickly learns to generate the low sample class and hardens its discriminator simultaneously. In contrast to ML classifiers that require security hardening after being adversarially trained by GAN-generated data, EVAGAN renders it needless. The experimental analysis proves that EVAGAN is an efficient evasion hardened model for low data regimes for the selected cybersecurity and computer vision datasets.",

This paper presents a new semi-supervised GANs with Multiple generators and a classifier (MCGAN). This model improves the stability of training for SAR images by employing multiple generators. A multi-classifier is introduced to the new GANs to utilize the labeled images during the training of the GANs, which shares the low level layers with the discriminator.

To address this problem, we propose an novel Bayesian cyclic model and an integrated cyclic framework for interdomain mappings. The proposed method motivated by Bayesian GAN explores the full posteriors of cyclic model via sampling latent variables and optimizes the model with maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. Hence, we name it Bayesian CycleGAN. In addition, original CycleGAN cannot generate diversified results. But it is feasible for Bayesian framework to diversify generated images by replacing restricted latent variables in inference process. We evaluate the proposed Bayesian CycleGAN on multiple benchmark data sets, including Cityscapes, Maps, and Monet2photo. The proposed method improve the per-pixel accuracy by 15% for the Cityscapes semantic segmentation task within origin framework and improve 20% within the proposed integrated framework, showing better resilience to imbalance confrontation. The diversified results of Monet2Photo style transfer also demonstrate its superiority over original cyclic model.

Built upon the Vanilla GAN's two-player game between the discriminator $D_1$ and the generator $G$, we introduce a peer discriminator $D_2$ to the min-max game. Similar to previous work using two discriminators, the first role of both $D_1$, $D_2$ is to distinguish between generated samples and real ones, while the generator tries to generate high-quality samples which are able to fool both discriminators. Different from existing methods, we introduce another game between $D_1$ and $D_2$ to discourage their agreement and therefore increase the level of diversity of the generated samples. This property alleviates the issue of early mode collapse by preventing $D_1$ and $D_2$ from converging too fast. We provide theoretical analysis for the equilibrium of the min-max game formed among $G, D_1, D_2$. We offer convergence behavior of DuelGAN as well as stability of the min-max game. It's worth mentioning that DuelGAN operates in the unsupervised setting, and the duel between $D_1$ and $D_2$ does not need any label supervision. Experiments results on a synthetic dataset and on real-world image datasets (MNIST, Fashion MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, CelebA, VGG, and FFHQ) demonstrate that DuelGAN outperforms competitive baseline work in generating diverse and high-quality samples, while only introduces negligible computation cost.",

Despite this work, GANs still have a long way to go before they see mainstream adoption, owing largely to their infamous training instability. Here I propose the Autoencoding Generative Adversarial Network (AEGAN), a four-network model which learns a bijective mapping between a specified latent space and a given sample space by applying an adversarial loss and a reconstruction loss to both the generated images and the generated latent vectors. The AEGAN technique offers several improvements to typical GAN training, including training stabilization, mode-collapse prevention, and permitting the direct interpolation between real samples. The effectiveness of the technique is illustrated using an anime face dataset.",

        "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) has become more and more popular these years. However, it is difficult to train and suffers from the training instability problem. To tackle this difficulty, this paper proposes a novel approach. Our idea is intuitive but proven to be very useful. In essence, it combines saturating loss and non-saturating loss into the loss function. Thus it will exploit the complementary statistical properties from two kinds of loss functions to effectively improve the training stability. We term our method twin discriminator Generative Adversarial Networks (TWGAN), which, unlike GAN, has a generator and a twin discriminator. The twin discriminator consists of two discriminators with identical architecture and both of them aim to distinguish whether the samples are from real data or fake data. We develop theoretical analysis to show that, given the optimal discriminators, optimizing the generator of TWGAN reduces to minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the distribution of generated data (<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$P_g$</tex-math></inline-formula>) and the distribution of real data (<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$P_data$</tex-math></inline-formula>), hence effectively addressing the training instability problem.

Existing methods for image inpainting either fill the missing regions by borrowing information from surrounding areas or generating semantically coherent content from region context. They often produce ambiguous or semantically incoherent content when the missing region is large or with complex structures. In this paper, we present an approach for image inpainting. The completion model based on our proposed algorithm contains one generator, one global discriminator, and one local discriminator. The generator is responsible for inpainting the missing area, the global discriminator aims evaluating whether the repair result has global consistency, and the local discriminator is responsible for identifying whether the repair area is correct. The architecture of the generator is an auto-encoder. We use the skip-connection in the generator to improve the prediction power of the model. Also, we use Wasserstein GAN loss to ensure the stability of training.

In this paper, we propose a one class fault detection scheme, based on the unsupervised training of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The generator tries to learn the manifold of normal behavior of the process, while the final decision of fault occurrence is taken from the discriminator. The network architectures of the discriminator and the generator and the hyper-parameters, that are used during training, are crucial for the stability of the GAN model. To ensure system convergence during training and to enhance the accuracy of the unsupervised classifier, a model selection algorithm is used. The latter one evaluates each trained model on a validation set of the normal training dataset, based on a proposed performance metric. Also, a method for evaluating the generating ability of each trained generative model is introduced, based on the reconstruction cost of an Autoencoder (AE). The proposed evaluation method of generative models, is used on the search algorithm, which selects the final classifier model.

Our regularizer guides the rectifier discriminator D to better allocate its model capacity, by encouraging the binary activation patterns on selected internal layers of D to have a high joint entropy.

Even though seismological research using low-cost micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) sensor received much attention recently, because of the lack of data recorded by such MEMS sensors whose data are usually polluted by different types of noise. Therefore, increasing seismic datasets is required by intelligently generating seismic data through data-augmentation techniques. However, it is difficult to characterize and measure the evolution process of seismic sequences, making the feature extraction and data generation of seismic sequences still a significant challenge. By combining the framework of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with long short-term memory (LSTM), attention mechanism and neural network (NN), a novel deep generation model (DGM) named EQGAN is developed to overcome the challenges, which can automatically capture the different time histories and dimension characteristics of seismic sequences, meanwhile stably generating high-quality seismic data. The reality of generated data is qualitatively clarified through the analysis of frequency domain and data autocorrelation distribution. Based on the High-throughput Screening (HTS) Theory, the quantitative evaluation index of statistical metrics is designed, and the generation performance of different machine learning models (standard GAN, LSTM, NN) is compared to prove the stability and effectiveness of EQGAN. The experimental results denote that the EQGAN has excellent stability and performance (up to 81%, much higher than that of other generation models), which provides a suitable data expansion approach for the field of seismological research.",

The current manual detection of EL images is slow and requires relevant expertise, so methods based on computer vision for automatic detection in EL images are appearing. However, due to the heterogeneously background of the EL images and the lack of defect samples, automatic detection of defects has been a challenging task. We design a model based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) and auto-encoder (AE) to perform defect detection for EL images of solar cells. It only requires normal images in the training process and detect defects by measuring the residuals between the test image and the constructed image generated by the generator. To reduce the effects of image distortion, we combine structural similarity index (SSIM) with feature residuals to train the encoder, which can get better results than the model using typical mean square error (MSE). During the detection phase, SSIM and MSE are combined as the anomaly score. Our method has higher recognition of defective EL images and achieves detection accuracy of 90.0% on the test set. Compared with the method using only MSE, the F1 score is increased obviously.",

One challenge associated with an equally weighted sum of two losses is that the training may benefit one loss but harm the other, which we show causes instability and mode collapse. In this paper, we introduce a new family of discriminator loss functions that adopts a weighted sum of real and fake parts, which we call adaptive weighted loss functions or aw-loss functions. Using the gradients of the real and fake parts of the loss, we can adaptively choose weights to train a discriminator in the direction that benefits the GAN\u2019s stability. Our method can be potentially applied to any discriminator model with a loss that is a sum of the real and fake parts.

The scalable nature of GANs allows high-dimensional, spatially-dependent probability distributions (i.e., random fields) to be inferred, while incorporating prior information through PDEs allows the training datasets to be relatively small. \nIn this work, PI-GANs are demonstrated for the application of elastic modulus estimation in mechanical testing. Given measured deformation data, the underlying probability distribution of spatially-varying elastic modulus (stiffness) is learned. Two feed-forward deep neural network generators are used to model the deformation and material stiffness across a two dimensional domain. Wasserstein GANs with gradient penalty are employed for enhanced stability. In the absence of explicit training data, it is demonstrated that the PI-GAN learns to generate realistic, physically-admissible realizations of material stiffness by incorporating the PDE that relates it to the measured deformation.

We first analyze the training dynamic of a prototypical Dirac GAN and adopt the widely-used closed-loop control (CLC) to improve its stability.

Most existing works focus on stabilizing the training for the discriminators of GANs while ignoring their generalization issue. In this work, we aim to improve the generalization capability of GANs by promoting the local robustness within the small neighborhood of the training samples. We prove that the robustness in the small neighborhood of the training sets can lead to better generalization. Particularly, we design a new robust method called Robust Generative Adversarial Network (RGAN) in which the generator and discriminator compete with each other in a worst-case setting within a small Wasserstein ball. The generator tries to map the worst input distribution (rather than a Gaussian distribution used in most GANs) to the real data distribution, while the discriminator attempts to distinguish the real and fake distributions with the worst perturbations . Intuitively, the proposed RGAN can learn a good generator and discriminator that can even perform well on the worst-case input points. Strictly, we have proved that RGAN can obtain a tighter generalization upper bound than the traditional GANs under mild assumptions, ensuring a theoretical superiority of RGAN over GANs. We conduct our proposed method on five different baselines (five popular GAN models).

One of the key issues is the generator\u2019s sensitivity to input data, which can cause sudden fluctuations in the generator\u2019s loss value with certain inputs. This sensitivity suggests an inadequate ability to resist disturbances in the generator, causing the discriminator\u2019s loss value to oscillate and negatively impacting the discriminator. Then, the negative feedback of discriminator is also not conducive to updating generator\u2019s parameters, leading to suboptimal image generation quality. In response to this challenge, we present an innovative GANs model equipped with a learnable auxiliary module that processes auxiliary noise. The core objective of this module is to enhance the stability of both the generator and discriminator throughout the training process. To achieve this target, we incorporate a learnable auxiliary penalty and an augmented discriminator, designed to control the generator and reinforce the discriminator\u2019s stability, respectively. We further apply our method to the Hinge and LSGANs loss functions, illustrating its efficacy in reducing the instability of both the generator and the discriminator.

Accordingly, generative models [e.g., generative adversarial network (GAN)] are typically used to synthesize the visual samples conditioned by the class semantic vectors and achieve remarkable progress for ZSL. However, existing GAN-based generative ZSL methods are based on hand-crafted models, which cannot adapt to various datasets/scenarios and fails to model instability. To alleviate these challenges, we propose evolutionary GAN search (termed EGANS) to automatically design the generative network with good adaptation and stability, enabling reliable visual feature sample synthesis for advancing ZSL. Specifically, we adopt cooperative dual evolution to conduct a neural architecture search (NAS) for both generator and discriminator under a unified evolutionary adversarial framework. EGANS is learned by two stages: 1) evolution generator architecture search and 2) evolution discriminator architecture search. During the evolution generator architecture search, we adopt a many-to-one adversarial training strategy to evolutionarily search for the optimal generator. Then the optimal generator is further applied to search for the optimal discriminator in the evolution discriminator architecture search with a similar evolution search algorithm. Once the optimal generator and discriminator are searched, we entail them into various generative ZSL baselines for ZSL classification. Extensive experiments show that EGANS consistently improve existing generative ZSL methods on the standard CUB, SUN, AWA2 and FLO datasets. The significant performance gains indicate that the evolutionary NAS explores a virgin field in ZSL.",

This paper proposes a new model called Identity Generative Adversarial Network (IGAN) that addresses these issues. This model is based on three modifications to the baseline deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN). The first change is to add a non-linear identity block to the architecture. This will make it easier for the model to fit complex data types and cut down on the time it takes to train. The second change is to smooth out the standard GAN loss function by using a modified loss function and label smoothing. The third and final change is to use minibatch training to let the model use other examples from the same minibatch as side information to improve the quality and variety of generated images. These changes help to stabilize the training process and improve the model\u2019s performance. The performance of the GAN models is compared using the inception score (IS) and the Fr\u00e9chet inception distance (FID), which are widely used metrics for evaluating the quality and diversity of generated images. The effectiveness of our approach was tested by comparing an IGAN model with other GAN models on the CelebA and stacked MNIST datasets. Results show that IGAN outperforms all the other models, achieving an IS of 13.95 and an FID of 43.71 after traning for 200 epochs. In addition to demonstrating the improvement in the performance of the IGAN, the instabilities, diversity, and fidelity of the models were investigated. The results showed that the IGAN was able to converge to a distribution of the real data more quickly. Furthermore, the experiments revealed that IGAN is capable of producing more stable and high-quality images. This suggests that IGAN is a promising approach for improving the training and performance of GANs and may have a range of applications in image synthesis and other areas.",

This mechanism aims to solve the mode collapse problem and enhance the training stability of the generated outputs. Within the SoftGAN, the objective of the discriminator is to learn a fuzzy concept of real data with a soft borderline between real and generated data. This objective is achieved by balancing the principles of maximum concept coverage and maximum expected entropy of fuzzy concepts. During the early training stage of the SoftGAN, the principle of maximum expected entropy of fuzzy concepts guides the learning process due to the significant divergence between the generated and real data. However, in the final stage of training, the principle of maximum concept coverage dominates as the divergence between the two distributions decreases. The dynamic borderline softening mechanism of the SoftGAN can be likened to a student (the generator) striving to create realistic images, with the tutor (the discriminator) dynamically guiding the student towards the right direction and motivating effective learning. The tutor gives appropriate encouragement or requirements according to abilities of the student at different stages, so as to promote the student to improve themselves better. Our approach offers both theoretical and practical benefits for improving GAN training. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of our SoftGAN approach in addressing mode collapse issues and generating high-quality outputs compared to existing approaches.",

VAEs are renowned for their robust probabilistic foundations and capacity for complex data representation learning, while GANs are celebrated for generating high-fidelity images. Despite their strengths, both models have limitations: VAEs often produce less sharp outputs, and GANs face challenges with training stability. The hybrid VAE-GAN models harness the strengths of both architectures to overcome these limitations, enhancing output quality and diversity. We provide a comprehensive overview of VAEs and GANs technology developments, their integration strategies, and resultant performance improvements. Applications across various fields, such as artistic creation, medical imaging, e-commerce, and video gaming, highlight the transformative potential of these models. However, challenges in model robustness, ethical concerns, and computational demands persist, posing significant hurdles. Future research directions are poised to transform the VAE-GAN landscape significantly. Enhancing training stability remains a priority, with new approaches such as incorporating self-correcting mechanisms into GANs training being tested. Addressing ethical issues is also critical, as policymakers and technologists work together to develop standards that prevent misuse. Moreover, reducing computational costs is fundamental to democratizing access to these technologies. Projects such as the development of MobileNetV2 have made strides in creating more efficient neural network architectures that maintain performance while being less resource-intensive.

The U-Net based GAN (U-Net GAN), a recently developed approach, can generate high-quality synthetic images by using a U-Net architecture for the discriminator. However, this model may suffer from severe mode collapse. In this study, a stable U-Net GAN (SUGAN) is proposed to mainly solve this problem. First, a gradient normalization module is introduced to the discriminator of U-Net GAN. This module effectively reduces gradient magnitudes, thereby greatly alleviating the problems of gradient instability and overfitting. As a result, the training stability of the GAN model is improved. Additionally, in order to solve the problem of blurred edges of the generated images, a modified residual network is used in the generator. This modification enhances its ability to capture image details, leading to higher-definition generated images. Extensive experiments conducted on several datasets show that the proposed SUGAN significantly improves over the Inception Score (IS) and Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) metrics compared with several state-of-the-art and classic GANs. The training process of our SUGAN is stable, and the quality and diversity of the generated samples are higher. This clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach for image generation tasks.

In this paper, we introduce a novel method to analyze the convergence and stability in the training of generative adversarial networks. For this purpose, we propose to decompose the objective function of the adversary min\u2013max game defining a periodic GAN into its Fourier series. By studying the dynamics of the truncated Fourier series for the continuous alternating gradient descend algorithm, we are able to approximate the real flow and to identify the main features of the convergence of GAN. This approach is confirmed empirically by studying the training flow in a 2-parametric GAN, aiming to generate an unknown exponential distribution. As a by-product, we show that convergent orbits in GANs are small perturbations of periodic orbits so the Nash equillibria are spiral attractors. This theoretically justifies the slow and unstable training observed in GANs.",

Differently from previous distributed GANs training techniques, our approach avoids inter-process communications, reduces the risk of mode collapse and enhances scalability by using multiple generators, each one of them concurrently trained on a single data label. The use of the Wasserstein metric also reduces the risk of cycling by stabilizing the training of each generator. We illustrate the approach on the CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet1k datasets, three standard benchmark image datasets, maintaining the original resolution of the images for each dataset. Performance is assessed in terms of scalability and final accuracy within a limited fixed computational time and computational resources. To measure accuracy, we use the inception score, the Fr\u00e9chet inception distance, and image quality. An improvement in inception score and Fr\u00e9chet inception distance is shown in comparison to previous results obtained by performing the parallel approach on deep convolutional conditional generative adversarial neural networks as well as an improvement of image quality of the new images created by the GANs approach. Weak scaling is attained on both datasets using up to 2000 NVIDIA V100 GPUs on the OLCF supercomputer Summit.",

Therefore, in this article, we propose an improved method of deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN) with discriminator gradient gap regularization (IDIG-GAN), which can effectively solve the problems of unstable training and poor training performance under a small sample dataset. Firstly, the self-attention mechanism is integrated into the DCGAN to capture global information to enhance the generalization capability of the network. Moreover, gradient normalization is applied to the discriminator to address the problem of vanishing gradients in the network. Furthermore, gradient gap regularization is incorporated into the loss function to narrow the gap between the discriminator gradient norms, thereby improving network stability when dealing with small fault datasets. Through training with the improved IDIG-GAN, then the generated samples are used to expand the dataset and construct a fault diagnosis model.

        "abstract": "Introduction Electroencephalography (EEG) signals frequently contain substantial noise and interference, which can obscure clinically and scientifically relevant features. Traditional denoising approaches, such as linear filtering or wavelet thresholding, often struggle with nonlinear or time-varying artifacts. In response, the present study explores a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework to enhance EEG signal quality, focusing on two variants: a conventional GAN model and a Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP). Methods Data were obtained from two distinct EEG datasets: a \u201chealthy\u201d set of 64-channel recordings collected during various motor/imagery tasks, and an \u201cunhealthy\u201d set of 18-channel recordings from individuals with orthopedic impairments. Both datasets underwent comprehensive preprocessing, including band-pass filtering (8\u201330 Hz), channel standardization, and artifact trimming. The training stage involved adversarial learning, in which a generator sought to reconstruct clean EEG signals while a discriminator (or critic in the case of WGAN-GP) attempted to distinguish between real and generated signals. The model evaluation was conducted using quantitative metrics such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), correlation coefficient, mutual information, and dynamic time warping (DTW) distance. Results Experimental findings indicate that adversarial learning substantially improves EEG signal fidelity across multiple quantitative metrics. Specifically, WGAN-GP achieved an SNR of up to 14.47 dB (compared to 12.37 dB for the standard GAN) and exhibited greater training stability, as evidenced by consistently lower relative root mean squared error (RRMSE) values. In contrast, the conventional GAN model excelled in preserving finer signal details, reflected in a PSNR of 19.28 dB and a correlation coefficient exceeding 0.90 in several recordings. Both adversarial frameworks outperformed classical wavelet-based thresholding and linear filtering methods, demonstrating superior adaptability to nonlinear distortions and dynamic interference patterns in EEG time-series data. Discussion By systematically comparing standard GAN and WGAN-GP architectures, this study highlights a practical trade-off between aggressive noise suppression and high-fidelity signal reconstruction. The demonstrated improvements in signal quality underscore the promise of adversarially trained models for applications ranging from basic neuroscience research to real-time brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCIs) in clinical or consumer-grade settings. The results further suggest that GAN-based frameworks can be easily scaled to next-generation wireless networks and complex electrophysiological datasets, offering robust and dynamic solutions to long-standing challenges in EEG denoising.",

The fabrication of dental restorations, however, remains challenging due to the complexity of the human masticatory system as well as the unique morphology of each individual dentition. Adaptation and reworking are frequently required during the insertion of fixed dental prostheses (FDPs), which increase cost and treatment time. This article proposes a data-driven approach for the partial reconstruction of occlusal surfaces based on a data set that comprises 92 3D mesh files of full dental crown restorations.\n\n\nMethods\nA Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is considered for the given task in view of its ability to represent extensive data sets in an unsupervised manner with a wide variety of applications. Having demonstrated good capabilities in terms of image quality and training stability, StyleGAN-2 has been chosen as the main network for generating the occlusal surfaces. A 2D projection method is proposed in order to generate 2D representations of the provided 3D tooth data set for integration with the StyleGAN architecture. The reconstruction capabilities of the trained network are demonstrated by means of 4 common inlay types using a Bayesian Image Reconstruction method. This involves pre-processing the data in order to extract the necessary information of the tooth preparations required for the used method as well as the modification of the initial reconstruction loss.\n\n\nResults\nThe reconstruction process yields satisfactory visual and quantitative results for all preparations with a root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 0.02 mm to 0.18 mm. When compared against a clinical procedure for CAD inlay fabrication, the group of dentists preferred the GAN-based restorations for 3 of the total 4 inlay geometries.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis article shows the effectiveness of the StyleGAN architecture with a downstream optimization process for the reconstruction of 4 different inlay geometries. The independence of the reconstruction process and the initial training of the GAN enables the application of the method for arbitrary inlay geometries without time-consuming retraining of the GAN.",

        "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) outperforms its peers in the generative models\u2019 family and is widely used to generate realistic samples in various domains. The basic idea of GAN is a competition between two networks called a generator and discriminator. Throughout the training process of GAN, the two networks face various challenges that affect the quality and diversity of the generated samples of GAN. These challenges include training instability and mode collapse problem. Training instability happens due to the variance of the performance between the generator and discriminator. The mode collapse, on the other hand, happens when the generator is stuck to generate diverse samples. One of the promising techniques that might overcome these issues and increase the networks\u2019 performance is transfer learning between discriminators as same as generators. In this regard, the contribution of this paper is fourfold. First, it proposes a novel approach called Collaborative-GAN based on transfer learning to mitigate the training instability and tackle the mode collapse issues. In the proposed approach, the well-performer network transfers its learned weights to the low-performer ones based on a periodical evaluation during the training process. Second, the paper proposes a novel method to evaluate the discriminators\u2019 performance based on a fuzzy inference system. Third, the paper proposes a method to evaluate the generators\u2019 performance based on a series of detected FID scores that measure the diversity of the generated samples every certain intervals during the training process. We apply the proposed approach on two different architectures of GAN, which we called Single-GAN and Dual-GANs. In Single-GAN, the weights are transferred between the identical networks within the same GAN model. In Dual-GANs, on the other hand, the weights are transferred between identical networks across different GAN models. Thus, the paper introduces two types of transfer learning for GANs; inter and intra-transfer learning based on the paradigm of GAN architecture as a fourth contribution. We validate the proposed approach on three different benchmarks representing CelebA, Cifar-10, and Fashion-Mnist. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art GAN models in terms of FID metric that measures the generated sample diversity. It is worth noting that the proposed approach achieved remarkable FID scores of 11.44, 24.19, and 11.21 on the Fashion-Mnist, Cifar-10, and CelebA datasets respectively.",

The generator generates synthetic data, while the discriminator evaluates the authenticity of the data. This dynamic interaction forms a minimax game that produces high-quality synthetic data. Since its introduction in 2014 by Ian Goodfellow, GAN has evolved through various innovative architectures, including Vanilla GAN, Conditional GAN (cGAN), Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN), CycleGAN, StyleGAN, Wasserstein GAN (WGAN), and BigGAN. Each of these architectures presents a novel approach to address technical challenges such as training stability, data diversification, and result quality. GANs have been widely applied in various sectors. In healthcare, GANs are used to generate synthetic medical images that support diagnostic development without violating patient privacy. In the media and entertainment industry, GANs facilitate the enhancement of image and video resolution, as well as the creation of realistic content. However, the development of GANs faces challenges such as mode collapse, training instability, and inadequate quality evaluation. In addition to technical challenges, GANs raise ethical issues, such as the misuse of the technology for deepfake creation. Legal regulations, detection tools, and public education are important mitigation measures. Future trends suggest that GANs will be increasingly used in text-to-image synthesis, realistic video generation, and integration with multimodal systems to support cross-disciplinary innovation.",

Researchers have turned to federated learning (FL) for distributed-GAN (D-GAN) implementations, but efforts often fall short due to training instability and poor synchronization within GAN components. In this study, we present DRL-GAN, a lightweight Wasserstein conditional distributed relativistic loss-GAN designed to overcome existing limitations. DRL-GAN ensures training stability in the face of nonconvex losses by employing a single global generator on the central server and a discriminator per client. Utilizing Wasserstein-1 for relativistic loss computation between real and fake samples, DRL-GAN effectively addresses issues, such as mode collapses, vanishing, and exploding gradients, accommodating both iid and non-iid private data in clients and fostering strong convergence. The absence of a robust conditional distributed-GAN model serves as another motivation for this work. We provide a comprehensive mathematical formulation of DRL-GAN and validate our claims empirically on CIFAR-10, MNIST, EuroSAT, and LSUN-Bedroom datasets.",

        "abstract": "In industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems, imbalanced datasets are prevalent because of the relative ease of acquiring normal operational data compared to abnormal or faulty data. An unbalanced distribution of data may lead to a biased learning problem, resulting in performance degradation of deep learning models. Data augmentation approaches based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) have been proposed to mitigate biased learning problems. However, GAN-based approaches constructed solely with convolutional neural networks may be incapable of extracting temporal properties from data. To utilize the temporal properties of data, a novel GAN structure consisting of an embedding network and recurrent neural networks is proposed in this paper. Additionally, in the novel GAN model based on mean-squared error, modified loss and mutual information terms are employed to improve training stability. From simulation results, it is confirmed that classification accuracy can be significantly improved by up to 54% based on the proposed method when compared with conventional fault diagnosis methods.",

        "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) significantly advanced image generation but their performance heavily depends on abundant training data. In scenarios with limited data, GANs often struggle with discriminator overfitting and unstable training. Batch Normalization (BN), despite being known for enhancing generalization and training stability, has rarely been used in the discriminator of Data-Efficient GANs. Our work addresses this gap by identifying a critical flaw in BN: the tendency for gradient explosion during the centering and scaling steps. To tackle this issue, we present CHAIN (lipsCHitz continuity constrAIned Normalization), which replaces the conventional centering step with zero-mean regularization and integrates a Lips-chitz continuity constraint in the scaling step. CHAIN further enhances GAN training by adaptively interpolating the normalized and unnormalized features, effectively avoiding discriminator overfitting. Our theoretical analyses firmly establishes CHAIN's effectiveness in reducing gradients in latent features and weights, improving stability and generalization in GAN training. Empirical evidence supports our theory. CHAIN achieves state-of-the-art results in data-limited scenarios on CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, five low-shot and seven high-resolution few-shot image datasets.",

Recently, deep learning (DL) based channel estimation schemes for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems have achieved remarkable success. However, the performance of channel estimation algorithms still needs to be improved. Meanwhile, the loss functions in traditional DL-based methods are not well designed and investigated. In this paper, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) variant based channel estimation method to improve the channel estimation accuracy. Specifically, two DL networks are trained adversarially with the received signals as the conditional input to learn an adaptive loss function. Furthermore, the GAN variant can also learn the mapping from the received signals to the real channels. To improve the training stability of GANs, a loss function is proposed to ensure the correct optimization direction of training the generator. To further improve the estimation performance, we investigate the influence of the hyper-parameter of the loss function on the performance of our model. Our extensive simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms traditional DL-based methods and shows great robustness.",

This cancer is known for its aggressive growth, highlighting the necessity of early detection. Our research introduces a novel deep learning framework for melanoma classification, trained and validated using the extensive SIIM\u2010ISIC Melanoma Classification Challenge\u2010ISIC\u20102020 dataset. The framework features three dilated convolution layers that extract critical feature vectors for classification. A key aspect of our model is incorporating the Off\u2010policy Proximal Policy Optimization (Off\u2010policy PPO) algorithm, which effectively handles data imbalance in the training set by rewarding the accurate classification of underrepresented samples. In this framework, the model is visualized as an agent making a series of decisions, where each sample represents a distinct state. Additionally, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) augments training data to improve generalizability, paired with a new regularization technique to stabilize GAN training and prevent mode collapse. The model achieved an F\u2010measure of 91.836% and a geometric mean of 91.920%, surpassing existing models and demonstrating the model's practical utility in clinical environments. These results demonstrate its potential in enhancing early melanoma detection and informing more accurate treatment approaches, significantly advancing in combating this aggressive cancer.",

To capture good quality pCLE data which is important for diagnosis, the probe-tissue contact needs to be maintained within a working range of micrometre scale. This can be achieved through micro-surgical robotic manipulation which requires the automatic estimation of the probe-tissue distance. In this paper, we propose a novel deep regression framework composed of the Deep Regression Generative Adversarial Network (DR-GAN) and a Sequence Attention (SA) module. The aim of DR-GAN is to train the network using an enhanced image-based supervision approach. It extents the standard generator by using a well-defined function for image generation, instead of a learnable decoder. Also, DR-GAN uses a novel learnable neural perceptual loss which combines for the first time spatial and frequency domain features. This effectively suppresses the adverse effects of noise in the pCLE data. To incorporate temporal information, we\u2019ve designed the SA module which is a cross-attention module, enhanced with Radial Basis Function based encoding (SA-RBF). Furthermore, to train the regression framework, we designed a multi-step training mechanism. During inference, the trained network is used to generate data representations which are fused along time in the SA-RBF module to boost the regression stability. Our proposed network advances SOTA networks by addressing the challenge of excessive noise in the pCLE data and enhancing regression stability. It outperforms SOTA networks applied on the pCLE Regression dataset (PRD) in terms of accuracy, data quality and stability.",

A significant challenge in these areas is the limited availability of high-quality datasets, which can hinder the accuracy of the predictive models. To address this issue, this paper proposes leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic samples for training. Despite their potential, traditional GAN face challenges such as mode collapse, vanishing gradients, and pixel integrity issues. This paper introduces a novel architecture, Penca-GAN, which enhances GANs through three key modifications: (1) dual loss functions to ensure pixel integrity and promote diversity in augmented images, effectively mitigating mode collapse and improving the quality of synthetic data; (2) the integration of an identity block to stabilize training, preserving essential input features and facilitating smoother gradient flow; and (3) a pancreas-inspired metaheuristic loss function that dynamically adapts to variations in training data to maintain pixel coherence and diversity. Extensive experiments on three renewable energy datasets\u2014SKY images, Solar images, and Wind Turbine images\u2014demonstrate the effectiveness of the Penca-GAN architecture. Our comparative analysis revealed that Penca-GAN consistently achieved the lowest Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) scores (164.45 for SKY, 113.54 for Solar, and 109.34 for Wind Turbine), indicating superior image quality compared to other architectures. Additionally, it attains the highest Inception Score (IS) across all datasets, scoring 71.43 for SKY, 87.65 for Solar, and 90.32 for Wind Turbine. Furthermore, the application of Penca-GAN significantly enhanced the fault detection capabilities, achieving accuracy improvements from 85.92 to 90.04% for solar panels and from 86.06 to 90.43% for wind turbines. These results underscore Penca-GAN\u2019s robust performance in generating high-fidelity synthetic images, significantly advancing renewable energy applications, and improving model performance in critical tasks such as fault detection and energy prediction.",
