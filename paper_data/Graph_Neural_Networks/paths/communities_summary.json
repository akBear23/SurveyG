    "summary": "1.  **Reasoning for Clustering:**\n\nI clustered the papers into three distinct subgroups based on their primary research questions, methodological innovations, and the specific challenges they aim to address within the broader field of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).\n\n*   **Subgroup 1: Core GNN Mechanisms, Depth, and Expressivity** focuses on fundamental limitations inherent in the GNN message-passing paradigm, such as over-smoothing, limited expressiveness (e.g., Weisfeiler-Lehman test), and the difficulty of building deep architectures. Papers in this group often propose architectural modifications, theoretical analyses, or novel propagation schemes to overcome these foundational issues, aiming to make GNNs more powerful and general-purpose.\n*   **Subgroup 2: Robustness, Adaptability, and Structure Learning for Real-World Graphs** addresses the challenges of applying GNNs to imperfect, noisy, or structurally complex real-world graphs. This includes scenarios with missing data, mixed homophilic/heterophilic patterns, or the need to learn the optimal graph structure itself. These papers focus on making GNNs more robust to data imperfections and adaptable to diverse, often non-ideal, graph topologies.\n*   **Subgroup 3: GNN Applications, Scalability, and Comprehensive Reviews** encompasses papers that apply GNNs to specific downstream tasks (e.g., recommendation, NLP, link prediction), tackle practical deployment challenges like scalability, or provide broad overviews and taxonomies of the GNN field or its sub-domains. These papers often showcase the utility of GNNs in real-world systems or synthesize existing knowledge to guide future research.\n\nThis categorization allows for a structured analysis of how GNN research progresses from fundamental theoretical understanding to practical robustness and diverse applications.\n\n2.  **Subgroup Analysis:**\n\n*   **Subgroup 1: Core GNN Mechanisms, Depth, and Expressivity**\n    *   *Papers*: [rusch2023xev] A Survey on Oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks (2023), [cai2020k4b] A Note on Over-Smoothing for Graph Neural Networks (2020), [klicpera20186xu] Predict then Propagate: Graph Neural Networks meet Personalized PageRank (2018), [liu2020w3t] Towards Deeper Graph Neural Networks (2020), [zhou20213lg] Dirichlet Energy Constrained Learning for Deep Graph Neural Networks (2021), [bianchi20194ea] Graph Neural Networks With Convolutional ARMA Filters (2019), [wang2024oi8] Non-convolutional Graph Neural Networks (2024), [zhu2021zc3] Interpreting and Unifying Graph Neural Networks with An Optimization Framework (2021), [kang2024fsk] Unleashing the Potential of Fractional Calculus in Graph Neural Networks with FROND (2024)\n    *   *Analysis*: This cluster primarily employs theoretical analysis (e.g., Dirichlet energy, spectral properties, generalization bounds) and architectural innovations (e.g., decoupling, novel filters, non-convolutional designs) to address fundamental GNN limitations. Their thematic focus is on overcoming over-smoothing, enhancing expressiveness beyond the WL test, and enabling truly deep GNNs capable of capturing long-range dependencies. [klicpera20186xu] pioneered decoupling prediction and propagation using Personalized PageRank, a concept further explored by [liu2020w3t] which re-evaluated over-smoothing's role at moderate depths. [cai2020k4b] and [rusch2023xev] provided rigorous theoretical frameworks for understanding over-smoothing via Dirichlet energy, with [zhou20213lg] leveraging this for a principled deep GNN design (EGNN). [bianchi20194ea] introduced more expressive ARMA filters, while [wang2024oi8] proposed a fundamentally non-convolutional architecture (RUM) to jointly tackle expressiveness, over-smoothing, and over-squashing. [zhu2021zc3] offered a unifying optimization framework for GNN propagation, and [kang2024fsk] generalized continuous GNNs with fractional calculus to capture memory effects and algebraically mitigate over-smoothing. A shared limitation is the complexity of theoretical proofs and the challenge of translating these insights into universally applicable, computationally efficient deep architectures for all graph types.\n\n*   **Subgroup 2: Robustness, Adaptability, and Structure Learning for Real-World Graphs**\n    *   *Papers*: [mao202313j] Demystifying Structural Disparity in Graph Neural Networks: Can One Size Fit All? (2023), [zheng2022qxr] Graph Neural Networks for Graphs with Heterophily: A Survey (2022), [ma2021sim] Is Homophily a Necessity for Graph Neural Networks? (2021), [luan202272y] Revisiting Heterophily For Graph Neural Networks (2022), [han2024rkj] Node-wise Filtering in Graph Neural Networks: A Mixture of Experts Approach (2024), [liu2023v3e] Learning Strong Graph Neural Networks with Weak Information (2023), [fatemi2021dmb] SLAPS: Self-Supervision Improves Structure Learning for Graph Neural Networks (2021), [chen2020bvl] Iterative Deep Graph Learning for Graph Neural Networks: Better and Robust Node Embeddings (2020), [zhao2020bmj] Data Augmentation for Graph Neural Networks (2020), [li2022315] Finding Global Homophily in Graph Neural Networks When Meeting Heterophily (2022), [xia20247w9] Learning Invariant Representations of Graph Neural Networks via Cluster Generalization (2024)\n    *   *Analysis*: This cluster focuses on making GNNs robust to imperfections and adaptable to diverse real-world graph structures, often employing adaptive filtering, structure learning, and data augmentation. Thematic contributions include addressing heterophily, handling weak or incomplete graph information, and improving generalization under structural shifts. [zheng2022qxr] provided a comprehensive survey on heterophily, while [ma2021sim] challenged the strict homophily assumption, distinguishing \"good\" from \"bad\" heterophily. [luan202272y] and [han2024rkj] further advanced heterophily handling with adaptive channel mixing and node-wise filtering, respectively. [fatemi2021dmb], [chen2020bvl], and [zhao2020bmj] focused on learning or augmenting graph structures, with [chen2020bvl]'s IDGL framework being a key innovation for iterative joint structure and embedding learning. [liu2023v3e] tackled the complex \"extreme weak information\" problem with a dual-channel approach, and [xia20247w9] addressed structure shift by learning invariant representations via cluster generalization. A common limitation is the computational cost of dynamic graph learning or adaptive mechanisms, and the challenge of ensuring learned structures truly generalize across diverse, unseen graph patterns.\n\n*   **Subgroup 3: GNN Applications, Scalability, and Comprehensive Reviews**\n    *   *Papers*: [xie2021n52] Self-Supervised Learning of Graph Neural Networks: A Unified Review (2021), [chang2021yyt] Sequential Recommendation with Graph Neural Networks (2021), [gao2022f3h] Graph Neural Networks for Recommender System (2022), [jin2021pf0] Graph Condensation for Graph Neural Networks (2021), [fan2019k6u] Graph Neural Networks for Social Recommendation (2019), [longa202399q] Graph Neural Networks for temporal graphs: State of the art, open challenges, and opportunities (2023), [zhang2018kdl] Link Prediction Based on Graph Neural Networks (2018), [khemani2024i8r] A review of graph neural networks: concepts, architectures, techniques, challenges, datasets, applications, and future directions (2024), [wang2023wrg] Graph Neural Networks for Text Classification: A Survey (2023)\n    *   *Analysis*: This cluster demonstrates the practical utility of GNNs across various domains and addresses real-world deployment challenges. Methodologies range from domain-specific GNN architectures to meta-analyses and scalability solutions. Thematic contributions include advancing recommendation systems, text classification, link prediction, and providing structured overviews of emerging GNN sub-fields. [khemani2024i8r] offers a broad overview of GNNs, while [gao2022f3h], [longa202399q], and [wang2023wrg] provide focused surveys on GNNs for recommendation, temporal graphs, and text classification, respectively, offering taxonomies and identifying open challenges. [fan2019k6u] and [chang2021yyt] showcase GNNs for social and sequential recommendation, with [chang2021yyt]'s SURGE being notable for dynamic graph construction. [zhang2018kdl]'s SEAL framework for link prediction introduced the beta-decaying heuristic theory, justifying local subgraph learning. [jin2021pf0]'s GCOND addresses the critical scalability challenge by condensing large graphs, a significant practical innovation. A common limitation for application-specific models is their domain specificity, while surveys, though valuable, are inherently time-bound and may not capture the latest rapid advancements.\n\n3.  **Overall Perspective:**\n\nThe intellectual trajectory of GNN research has evolved from addressing fundamental theoretical limitations to enhancing robustness in complex real-world scenarios, and finally to broad application and practical deployment. Initially, the field grappled with core issues like over-smoothing and limited expressiveness, as seen in Cluster 1, leading to architectural innovations like decoupling [klicpera20186xu] and novel filter designs [bianchi20194ea]. This foundational understanding directly informs Cluster 2, where researchers build more robust and adaptive GNNs that can handle imperfect data, heterophily, and structural shifts [luan202272y, chen2020bvl]. Finally, these advancements enable the successful application of GNNs to diverse domains and address practical concerns like scalability [jin2021pf0], as highlighted in Cluster 3. The field is transitioning from a focus on \"how GNNs work\" to \"how GNNs work *better* on *real-world* data,\" with an increasing emphasis on self-supervision [xie2021n52], dynamic graph learning [longa202399q], and efficient deployment.",

    "summary": "1.  **Clustering Reasoning:**\n\nI clustered the provided papers into three distinct subgroups based on their primary research objectives, core methodologies, and the specific challenges they address within the Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) landscape.\n\n1.  **Trustworthy GNNs: Robustness, Fairness, and Privacy**: This cluster encompasses papers focused on making GNNs reliable, ethical, and secure for real-world deployment. It includes research on identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities (adversarial attacks and defenses), ensuring equitable outcomes (fairness), and protecting sensitive information (privacy). These papers often employ optimization, adversarial learning, or architectural modifications to achieve their goals.\n2.  **GNN Explainability**: This subgroup is dedicated to understanding *why* GNNs make particular predictions. Papers here develop methods to interpret GNN decisions, ranging from identifying influential subgraphs/features for specific instances to discovering general model-level patterns, and establishing theoretical foundations for interpretability. Methodologies often involve perturbation, generative models, or mutual information maximization.\n3.  **GNN Applications, Scalability, and Benchmarking**: This cluster focuses on extending the practical utility of GNNs. It includes papers that demonstrate GNNs' effectiveness in diverse real-world domains, address the computational challenges of applying GNNs to massive graphs, and create standardized resources (datasets, benchmarks, comprehensive surveys) to facilitate research, evaluation, and adoption.\n\n2.  **Subgroup Analysis:**\n\n*   **Trustworthy GNNs: Robustness, Fairness, and Privacy**\n    *   *Papers*: [wang2022531] Improving Fairness in Graph Neural Networks via Mitigating Sensitive Attribute Leakage (2022), [zhang20222g3] Trustworthy Graph Neural Networks: Aspects, Methods, and Trends (2022), [dong202183w] Individual Fairness for Graph Neural Networks: A Ranking based Approach (2021), [wu2022vcx] Discovering Invariant Rationales for Graph Neural Networks (2022), [geisler2021dcq] Robustness of Graph Neural Networks at Scale (2021), [liu2021ee2] Elastic Graph Neural Networks (2021), [dai2020p5t] Say No to the Discrimination: Learning Fair Graph Neural Networks with Limited Sensitive Attribute Information (2020), [li20245zy] Rethinking Fair Graph Neural Networks from Re-balancing (2024), [zhang2020jrt] GNNGuard: Defending Graph Neural Networks against Adversarial Attacks (2020), [dong2021qcg] EDITS: Modeling and Mitigating Data Bias for Graph Neural Networks (2021), [he2020kz4] Stealing Links from Graph Neural Networks (2020), [zgner2019bbi] Adversarial Attacks on Graph Neural Networks via Meta Learning (2019), [xu2019l8n] Topology Attack and Defense for Graph Neural Networks: An Optimization Perspective (2019), [mujkanovic20238fi] Are Defenses for Graph Neural Networks Robust? (2023)\n    *   *Analysis*: This cluster employs diverse methodologies including adversarial attacks (e.g., meta-learning in [zgner2019bbi], convex relaxation in [xu2019l8n], scalable attacks in [geisler2021dcq]), defense mechanisms (e.g., pruning in [zhang2020jrt], adaptive smoothing in [liu2021ee2], adversarial training in [xu2019l8n]), fairness techniques (e.g., adversarial debiasing in [dai2020p5t] and [wang2022531], ranking-based in [dong202183w], data-centric in [dong2021qcg], re-balancing in [li20245zy]), and privacy attacks ([he2020kz4]). The thematic focus is on making GNNs reliable, ethical, and secure. [zhang20222g3] provides a comprehensive survey of these aspects, highlighting the unique challenges for GNNs. A key innovation is [zgner2019bbi]'s introduction of global poisoning attacks via meta-learning, which [geisler2021dcq] later scales to massive graphs. Critically, [mujkanovic20238fi] exposes that many GNN defenses are not robust against adaptive attacks, challenging the optimistic claims of earlier defense papers and highlighting a significant limitation in evaluative rigor across the field. [wu2022vcx] introduces invariant learning for causal rationales, bridging interpretability with robustness and fairness.\n\n*   **GNN Explainability**\n    *   *Papers*: [bui2024zy9] Explaining Graph Neural Networks via Structure-aware Interaction Index (2024), [yuan2020fnk] Explainability in Graph Neural Networks: A Taxonomic Survey (2020), [wang2024j6z] Unveiling Global Interactive Patterns across Graphs: Towards Interpretable Graph Neural Networks (2024), [yuan20208v3] XGNN: Towards Model-Level Explanations of Graph Neural Networks (2020), [vu2020zkj] PGM-Explainer: Probabilistic Graphical Model Explanations for Graph Neural Networks (2020), [chen2024woq] How Interpretable Are Interpretable Graph Neural Networks? (2024), [ying2019rza] GNNExplainer: Generating Explanations for Graph Neural Networks (2019)\n    *   *Analysis*: This cluster primarily uses perturbation-based methods, mutual information maximization, generative models (e.g., reinforcement learning in [yuan20208v3]), and probabilistic graphical models (e.g., Bayesian Networks in [vu2020zkj]). The thematic focus is on providing insights into GNN decision-making, from instance-level explanations to model-level patterns. [ying2019rza] (GNNExplainer) pioneered instance-level explanations by jointly optimizing for subgraph structure and node features. [yuan20208v3] (XGNN) introduced the first model-level explanations, while [wang2024j6z] further explored global patterns via graph coarsening. [bui2024zy9] advanced instance-level explanations by incorporating structure-aware interaction indices. [yuan2020fnk] provides a foundational survey and taxonomy for the field. A significant critique comes from [chen2024woq], which theoretically proves the approximation failures of many existing attention-based interpretable GNNs, highlighting a critical limitation in their faithfulness and generalizability.\n\n*   **GNN Applications, Scalability, and Benchmarking**\n    *   *Papers*: [ying20189jc] Graph Convolutional Neural Networks for Web-Scale Recommender Systems (2018), [varbella20242iz] PowerGraph: A power grid benchmark dataset for graph neural networks (2024), [bessadok2021bfy] Graph Neural Networks in Network Neuroscience (2021), [cui2022mjr] BrainGB: A Benchmark for Brain Network Analysis With Graph Neural Networks (2022), [jin2023ijy] A Survey on Graph Neural Networks for Time Series: Forecasting, Classification, Imputation, and Anomaly Detection (2023), [dong20225aw] Graph Neural Networks in IoT: A Survey (2022), [zhang2021jqr] Graph Neural Networks (2021), [mitra2024x43] Use of Graph Neural Networks in Aiding Defensive Cyber Operations (2024)\n    *   *Analysis*: This cluster focuses on applying GNNs to real-world problems and creating resources for their development. Core methodologies include efficient graph sampling (e.g., random walks in [ying20189jc]), specialized aggregation functions, and systematic dataset creation and benchmarking. The thematic focus is on demonstrating GNN utility, addressing scalability, and standardizing evaluation. [ying20189jc] (PinSage) is a landmark contribution, showcasing the first successful web-scale deployment of GCNs for recommender systems through significant engineering innovations. [varbella20242iz] (PowerGraph) and [cui2022mjr] (BrainGB) provide crucial, GNN-tailored benchmark datasets for power grids and brain networks, respectively, with [varbella20242iz] uniquely offering ground-truth explanations. Several papers ([bessadok2021bfy], [jin2023ijy], [dong20225aw], [mitra2024x43], [zhang2021jqr]) are surveys, consolidating knowledge and identifying future directions in specific application domains like neuroscience, time series, IoT, and cybersecurity. A shared limitation is the continuous need for larger, more diverse, and standardized real-world datasets, as well as scalable GNN architectures beyond initial successes.\n\n3.  **Overall Perspective:**\n\nThe intellectual trajectory of GNN research has rapidly evolved from foundational model development to addressing critical real-world deployment challenges. The initial success in \"GNN Applications, Scalability, and Benchmarking,\" exemplified by [ying20189jc]'s web-scale deployment, underscored the immense practical potential of GNNs. This success, however, immediately highlighted the imperative for the \"Trustworthy GNNs\" and \"GNN Explainability\" clusters. The field is transitioning from purely performance-driven model development to a more holistic approach that prioritizes responsible AI principles, with a strong emphasis on rigorous evaluation and theoretical understanding across all aspects of trustworthiness and interpretability. The unresolved tension lies in balancing predictive performance with these crucial trustworthiness aspects, often requiring trade-offs and novel architectural designs that are both effective and transparent.",

    "summary": "1. <think>\nThe clustering strategy is based on identifying the primary research question or technical challenge each paper addresses, along with its core methodological approach.\n\n**Cluster 1: Expressiveness and Theoretical Foundations**\nThis cluster groups papers that primarily focus on understanding and enhancing the inherent representational power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). A significant portion of these papers addresses the limitations imposed by the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test, which restricts many standard GNNs from distinguishing certain non-isomorphic graphs or capturing complex structural properties. Methodologies here include:\n*   **Formalizing GNN limits**: Papers that theoretically analyze what GNNs can and cannot do (e.g., connection to WL test, impossibility proofs for substructure counting).\n*   **Higher-order GNNs**: Architectures that move beyond node-level message passing to operate on k-tuples or subgraphs to increase discriminative power.\n*   **Augmenting GNNs for expressiveness**: Techniques like random node initialization, dropouts, learnable positional encodings, or explicit geometric/directional information to inject unique identifiers or richer structural context.\n*   **Spectral GNNs**: Papers exploring the expressive power of GNNs from a spectral perspective, often challenging assumptions about nonlinearity.\n*   **Dynamic/Adaptive Message Passing**: Models that allow for more flexible information flow to enhance expressiveness.\n\n**Cluster 2: Scalability and Deep GNN Architectures**\nThis cluster focuses on the practical challenges of deploying GNNs on large-scale graphs and building very deep GNN models. The core problems addressed are computational and memory bottlenecks, particularly \"neighbor explosion\" and \"over-squashing\" when increasing GNN depth or graph size.

Core approaches include self-supervised tasks like context prediction and attribute masking \\cite{hu2019r47}, generative modeling of attributed graphs \\cite{hu2020u8o}, and meta-learning to explicitly optimize for rapid adaptation during pre-training \\cite{lu20213kr}. The thematic focus is on addressing the scarcity of labeled data and the challenge of \"negative transfer\" by providing GNNs with a strong, transferable initialization. \\cite{hu2019r47} is foundational, systematically investigating strategies and introducing combined node/graph-level self-supervision. \\cite{hu2020u8o} innovates by proposing a generative pre-training task that explicitly models the dependency between node attributes and graph structure, crucial for complex graphs. \\cite{lu20213kr} further advances this by applying meta-learning to pre-training, directly optimizing for the model's ability to fine-tune, thereby bridging the objective divergence more explicitly than prior methods. A shared limitation is the computational intensity of pre-training on large graphs, and the reliance on specific self-supervised pretext tasks whose effectiveness can vary across domains.\n\n    *   *Subgroup name*: Prompt-based Adaptation and Task Alignment for GNNs\n    *   *Papers*:\n        *   \\cite{sun2022d18} GPPT: Graph Pre-training and Prompt Tuning to Generalize Graph Neural Networks (2022)\n        *   \\cite{fang2022tjj} Universal Prompt Tuning for Graph Neural Networks (2022)\n        *   \\cite{liu2023ent} GraphPrompt: Unifying Pre-Training and Downstream Tasks for Graph Neural Networks (2023)\n        *   \\cite{li202444f} Can Graph Neural Networks Learn Language with Extremely Weak Text Supervision? (2024)\n    *   *Analysis*: This subgroup explores advanced techniques for adapting pre-trained GNNs to diverse downstream tasks, moving beyond traditional fine-tuning by leveraging prompt-based learning. Methodologies include reformulating downstream tasks to align with pre-training objectives using \"token pairs\" \\cite{sun2022d18}, introducing universal prompts that modify input features \\cite{fang2022tjj}, and designing learnable prompts for the `ReadOut` operation to unify tasks under a subgraph similarity template \\cite{liu2023ent}. The thematic focus is on minimizing the \"objective gap\" between pre-training and downstream tasks, enabling efficient knowledge transfer, and facilitating few-shot or zero-shot generalization. \\cite{sun2022d18} introduced the idea of task reformulation via prompts to bridge the gap, while \\cite{fang2022tjj} provided a more universal and theoretically grounded approach by modifying input features. \\cite{liu2023ent} further generalized this by unifying diverse tasks and prompting the `ReadOut` function, offering greater flexibility. Most recently, \\cite{li202444f} extended prompt learning to a multi-modal setting, aligning GNNs with LLMs for semantic understanding and zero-shot capabilities, a significant step towards more semantically aware graph models. A common limitation is the careful design required for effective prompts, which can still be heuristic-driven, and the assumption of a well-pre-trained backbone GNN.\n\n3.  *Overall Perspective* (3-4 sentences):\n    The intellectual trajectory of GNN research, as evidenced by these papers, has evolved from establishing robust pre-training foundations to developing sophisticated adaptation mechanisms. The \"Foundational Pre-training\" subgroup laid the groundwork by addressing how to learn generalizable representations from unlabeled data, tackling issues like negative transfer and objective divergence through self-supervised tasks and meta-learning. Building upon this, the \"Prompt-based Adaptation\" subgroup represents a significant paradigm shift, moving from costly full fine-tuning to efficient, parameter-efficient adaptation by aligning pre-training and downstream tasks through various prompting strategies. This progression highlights a clear transition from *learning general graph knowledge* to *effectively leveraging that knowledge for specific, often low-resource, tasks*, with the latest work even bridging GNNs with large language models for multi-modal semantic understanding. The unresolved tension lies in finding truly universal pre-training objectives that inherently support diverse downstream tasks without requiring complex prompt engineering or task reformulation, pushing towards more intrinsically adaptable GNNs.",

[Gori05] first proposed a \"neural network for graphs\" based on a state-transition system, aiming to learn representations by iteratively propagating information until a stable fixed-point is reached. [Scarselli09] formalized this concept, defining the Graph Neural Network (GNN) model as an extension of recursive neural networks, emphasizing the fixed-point iteration for learning node embeddings. [Duvenaud15] introduced one of the earliest practical \"convolutional\" approaches for graphs, adapting the idea of summing neighbor features for molecular fingerprinting. While [Gori05] and [Scarselli09] were foundational in defining the GNN paradigm, their fixed-point iteration and computational complexity limited immediate widespread adoption. [Duvenaud15] provided a crucial step towards practical application, but its \"convolutional\" aggregation was still relatively simple compared to later developments, lacking the explicit spectral or attention-based mechanisms.\n\n2.  *Subgroup name*: Message-Passing Architectures and Inductive Learning\n    *   *Papers*:\n        *   [Kipf17] Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks (2017)\n        *   [Hamilton17] Inductive Representation Learning on Large Graphs (2017)\n        *   [Velickovic18] Graph Attention Networks (2018)\n    *   *Analysis*: This subgroup represents a pivotal shift towards scalable and effective GNN architectures, largely based on the message-passing paradigm. [Kipf17] introduced the highly influential Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), simplifying spectral graph convolutions into a localized, first-order approximation that became a de-facto standard for semi-supervised node classification. Building on this, [Hamilton17] addressed the critical challenge of inductive learning on large graphs with GraphSAGE, proposing a framework to learn node embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from neighbors, making GNNs applicable to dynamic and unseen graphs. [Velickovic18] further enhanced the expressiveness by introducing Graph Attention Networks (GATs), allowing the model to learn varying importance weights for different neighbors, overcoming the limitation of fixed-weight aggregation in earlier models like GCNs. While [Kipf17] popularized GCNs, it struggled with inductive tasks and varying neighbor importance, limitations directly addressed by [Hamilton17] and [Velickovic18] respectively, showcasing a clear progression in architectural sophistication and practical utility.\n\n3.  *Subgroup name*: Theoretical Understanding, Optimization, and Robustness\n    *   *Papers*:\n        *   [Xu19] How Powerful are Graph Neural Networks?

[Xu19] provided a fundamental theoretical contribution by analyzing the expressive power of GNNs, connecting them to the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test and highlighting their inherent limitations in distinguishing certain graph structures. [Wu19] focused on practical optimization, simplifying GCNs (SGC) by removing non-linearities and weight matrices between layers, demonstrating that simpler models can be highly effective and efficient. [Rong20] tackled the challenge of training deep GCNs, introducing DropEdge to mitigate over-smoothing and over-fitting, enabling the construction of more powerful multi-layer architectures. Finally, [Hu20] addressed the crucial need for standardized and rigorous evaluation by introducing the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB), providing diverse datasets and protocols to facilitate fair comparison and accelerate research. These papers collectively moved beyond simply proposing new models to understanding their fundamental limits, improving their practical deployment, and establishing a more rigorous scientific foundation for the field.\n\n*Overall Perspective*:\nThe intellectual trajectory of Graph Neural Networks has evolved from initial theoretical conceptualization to practical architectural breakthroughs, and finally to critical analysis, optimization, and standardization. The foundational models ([Gori05], [Scarselli09]) laid the mathematical groundwork, which was then transformed into widely applicable message-passing architectures by papers like [Kipf17], [Hamilton17], and [Velickovic18]. This second wave addressed scalability and expressiveness, making GNNs a dominant paradigm. The field then matured, as evidenced by the third subgroup, which critically examined GNNs' theoretical limits ([Xu19]), sought to optimize their efficiency ([Wu19]), enhance their robustness for deeper models ([Rong20]), and establish rigorous evaluation standards ([Hu20]). This progression highlights a key transition from \"how to build GNNs\" to \"how powerful are GNNs, and how can we make them better and evaluate them fairly,\" indicating a healthy and self-correcting research area.",
