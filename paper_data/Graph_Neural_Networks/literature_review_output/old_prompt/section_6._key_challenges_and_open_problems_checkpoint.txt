\section*{6. Key Challenges and Open Problems}
Despite the remarkable advancements and widespread adoption of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) across diverse domains, from recommender systems \cite{gao2022f3h} and drug discovery \cite{jiang2020gaq} to urban computing \cite{jin2023e18} and cybersecurity \cite{mitra2024x43}, the field continues to grapple with several fundamental and persistent challenges. These challenges are not merely incremental hurdles but often represent deep theoretical and practical limitations that hinder the full potential and reliable deployment of GNNs in real-world, complex scenarios \cite{khemani2024i8r, wu2022ptq}. This section critically analyzes these key challenges, encompassing the difficulties of scaling GNNs to massive and dynamic graphs, the inherent limitations in their expressive power, the crucial problem of generalization to unseen graph structures and mitigating distribution shifts, and the continuous need for robust evaluation and standardized benchmarking. Addressing these open problems is paramount for fostering reliable progress and ensuring the responsible and effective application of GNN technology. Many of these issues are interconnected; for instance, enhancing expressiveness might exacerbate scalability problems, while poor evaluation methodologies can obscure genuine advancements in generalization.

\subsection*{6.1. Scalability to Large and Dynamic Graphs}
The sheer scale and dynamic nature of many real-world graphs present significant computational and memory challenges for GNNs. Traditional message-passing GNNs often incur high computational costs, particularly for graphs with millions or billions of nodes and edges, as each layer requires aggregating information from expanding neighborhoods \cite{gao2022f3h}. This quadratic or even cubic complexity in terms of the number of nodes or edges makes direct application to massive graphs prohibitive. While sampling-based methods like GraphSAGE \cite{hamilton2017inductive} or mini-batching techniques offer practical solutions by limiting the receptive field, they often come with trade-offs in terms of information loss or approximation quality. Distributed training frameworks like DistGNN \cite{vasimuddin2021x7c} and scalable architectures such as SIGN \cite{rossi2020otv} and GNNAutoScale \cite{fey2021smn} have emerged to tackle this, but the fundamental challenge of processing the entire graph structure efficiently remains.

Beyond static scalability, real-world graphs are inherently dynamic, with nodes and edges appearing, disappearing, or changing attributes over time. Effectively handling these temporal graphs is a critical open problem \cite{longa202399q, jin2023e18}. Existing dynamic GNNs often rely on snapshot-based approaches, retraining, or incremental updates, which can be computationally intensive and struggle to capture continuous temporal dependencies \cite{li2020mk1, zhang20212ke}. For instance, in applications like ETA prediction in Google Maps \cite{derrowpinion2021mwn} or traffic flow forecasting \cite{li2020fil}, the graph structure and features evolve rapidly, demanding models that can adapt in real-time without catastrophic forgetting \cite{zhou2021c3l}. While some approaches like Scalable Spatiotemporal GNNs \cite{cini2022pjy} and Spatio-Spectral GNNs \cite{geisler2024wli} attempt to address this, the trade-off between capturing fine-grained temporal dynamics and maintaining computational efficiency is a persistent hurdle. Novel non-convolutional architectures, such as Random Walk with Unifying Memory (RUM) \cite{wang2024oi8}, offer a promising direction by achieving runtime complexity agnostic to the number of edges, which could alleviate some scalability concerns. Similarly, GloGNN \cite{li2022315} demonstrates linear time complexity for global aggregation, showcasing how algorithmic innovations can unlock scalability for specific challenges like heterophily. However, a unified, efficient, and expressive framework for truly massive and continuously evolving graphs remains an active area of research.

\subsection*{6.2. Persistent Issues with Expressiveness and Over-squashing}
A foundational limitation of many GNNs, particularly message-passing variants, is their restricted expressive power, often bounded by the 1-Weisfeiler-Leman (1-WL) graph isomorphism test \cite{xu2018c8q, morris20185sd}. This means they struggle to distinguish between certain non-isomorphic graphs or capture complex structural patterns like cycles of specific lengths \cite{chen2020e6g}. This theoretical bottleneck limits their ability to learn intricate graph properties crucial for many tasks.

Two related and widely recognized phenomena further compound this: over-smoothing and over-squashing. Over-smoothing occurs when node representations become increasingly similar and indistinguishable as information propagates through many GNN layers, leading to a loss of local distinctiveness \cite{oono2019usb, cai2020k4b, rusch2023xev}. This is a direct consequence of repeated neighborhood averaging, which acts as a low-pass filter \cite{zhou20213lg}. While techniques like residual connections \cite{li2021orq}, DropEdge \cite{rong2019dropedge}, or advanced propagation schemes \cite{klicpera20186xu, zeng2022jhz} aim to mitigate over-smoothing, they often do not fundamentally alter the information diffusion process that causes it. Over-squashing, on the other hand, refers to the information bottleneck that arises when aggregating information from exponentially growing receptive fields into fixed-size node embeddings, making it difficult to capture long-range dependencies \cite{alon2020fok, wu20221la}. This is particularly problematic for tasks requiring global graph understanding or interactions between distant nodes.

Recent research has made strides in addressing these issues. Path Neural Networks (PathNNs) \cite{michel2023hc4} directly tackle expressiveness by leveraging path information, demonstrating the ability to distinguish graphs that are 3-WL indistinguishable, significantly surpassing the 1-WL limit. This approach, however, can incur high computational costs for enumerating paths. The Random Walk with Unifying Memory (RUM) neural network \cite{wang2024oi8} offers a novel non-convolutional paradigm that jointly remedies limited expressiveness, over-smoothing, and over-squashing. RUM is theoretically shown to be more expressive than 1-WL and to attenuate over-smoothing by maintaining non-diminishing Dirichlet energy, and it alleviates over-squashing by improving gradient flow. Similarly, the FROND framework \cite{kang2024fsk} introduces fractional calculus to continuous GNNs, enabling the capture of non-local, memory-dependent dynamics and inherently mitigating over-smoothing through algebraic convergence. Despite these innovations, the trade-off between achieving higher expressiveness and maintaining computational efficiency and robustness remains a critical challenge. The theoretical gaps persist in developing universally applicable architectures that can overcome these fundamental limitations without introducing new complexities or relying on strong assumptions.

\subsection*{6.3. Generalization to Unseen Structures and Distribution Shifts}
A crucial challenge for the real-world deployment of GNNs is their ability to generalize effectively to unseen graph structures and to maintain performance under distribution shifts. Unlike grid-structured data (e.g., images), graphs can exhibit vast topological diversity, making inductive generalization particularly difficult. A GNN trained on one set of graphs might perform poorly on graphs with different statistical properties, node feature distributions, or underlying generative mechanisms. This is especially pertinent in applications where the target graph distribution might evolve or differ significantly from the training data, such as in anomaly detection \cite{tang2022g66, chai2022nf9} or fraud detection \cite{duan2024que}.

The problem of distribution shift is exacerbated in dynamic graph settings, where the evolving nature of the graph can lead to spatio-temporal distribution shifts that degrade model performance \cite{zhang2022uih}. For instance, a GNN trained for traffic prediction in one city might fail in another with different road network topology or traffic patterns. Pre-training strategies \cite{hu2019r47, hu2020u8o} and self-supervised learning techniques \cite{xie2021n52, fatemi2021dmb} have emerged as promising avenues to learn more generalizable graph representations. Methods like GPPT \cite{sun2022d18} and GraphPrompt \cite{liu2023ent} leverage pre-training and prompt tuning to enhance generalization capabilities, aiming to adapt models to new tasks or domains with minimal fine-tuning. Learning invariant representations, for example, via cluster generalization \cite{xia20247w9}, also seeks to make GNNs more robust to variations in graph structure.

However, the theoretical understanding of generalization in GNNs is still nascent \cite{jegelka20222lq, ju2023prm}. Current PAC-Bayesian bounds, while providing theoretical guarantees, often rely on assumptions about graph diffusion processes that may not hold in complex real-world scenarios \cite{ju2023prm}. The "arms race" dynamic here involves developing increasingly complex models that risk overfitting to specific graph structures versus designing simpler, more robust architectures that might sacrifice some expressiveness. Furthermore, identifying and mitigating the impact of distribution shifts requires robust causal inference frameworks that can disentangle spurious correlations from true causal relationships, a challenging task in graph data. The ability of GNNs to perform out-of-distribution detection \cite{wu2023303} is also critical, allowing models to signal uncertainty when encountering novel graph patterns, thereby enhancing trustworthiness.

\subsection*{6.4. The Need for Robust Evaluation and Benchmarking}
The rapid proliferation of GNN models has unfortunately been accompanied by inconsistencies and pitfalls in evaluation methodologies, hindering fair comparisons and obscuring genuine progress. A critical analysis by Li et al. \cite{li2023o4c} highlights several key issues in link prediction evaluation: underreported performance of existing baselines due to suboptimal hyperparameter tuning, a lack of unified data splits and evaluation metrics, and the use of unrealistic "easy" negative samples that do not reflect real-world challenges. This leads to an inflated sense of advancement, where new models might appear superior simply because they are compared against weakly tuned baselines or on simplified tasks.

The absence of standardized and challenging benchmarking frameworks makes it difficult to assess the true capabilities and limitations of novel GNN architectures. While efforts like Benchmarking Graph Neural Networks \cite{dwivedi20239ab} and domain-specific benchmarks such as BrainGB for brain network analysis \cite{cui2022mjr} and PowerGraph for power grids \cite{varbella20242iz} are crucial, their widespread adoption and continuous maintenance are essential. The problem of "easy" negative samples, as identified by \cite{li2023o4c}, is particularly acute in link prediction, where randomly sampled non-existent links often lack common neighbors, making them trivial to distinguish from positive links. To address this, Li et al. \cite{li2023o4c} propose the Heuristic Related Sampling Technique (HeaRT) to generate harder, more realistic negative samples, thereby providing a more robust evaluation setting.

Beyond link prediction, similar issues plague other GNN tasks. For instance, in explainability, defining and evaluating the "ground truth" for explanations remains an open problem, leading to subjective assessments of interpretability \cite{agarwal2022xfp, chen2024woq}. In robustness, the effectiveness of adversarial defenses for GNNs is often evaluated under specific attack models, and their generalizability to unseen or adaptive attacks is questionable \cite{mujkanovic20238fi}. The theoretical gaps in evaluation lie in developing universally accepted metrics that are robust to dataset variations and in designing adversarial benchmarks that truly test the limits of GNN performance under realistic conditions. The continuous need for benchmarks under specific challenging conditions, such as label noise \cite{wang2024481}, underscores the ongoing demand for rigorous and standardized evaluation to ensure that reported progress is reliable and impactful.
