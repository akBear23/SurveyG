\section*{7. Applications and Real-World Impact}
The transformative potential of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) extends far beyond theoretical advancements, manifesting in profound and diverse real-world impacts across a multitude of domains. GNNs excel at modeling complex, interconnected data, making them uniquely suited for tasks where relationships and structural dependencies are paramount \cite{wu2022ptq, khemani2024i8r, zhou20188n6}. Their ability to learn representations by aggregating information from local neighborhoods, and increasingly from global graph structures, has enabled breakthroughs in areas previously challenging for traditional machine learning methods. This section delineates the broad utility of GNNs, showcasing their versatility in handling intricate data patterns from social interactions to molecular structures. We will explore their successful deployment in enhancing recommender systems, accelerating scientific discovery, enabling predictive learning in dynamic urban environments, and fortifying cybersecurity defenses, among other emerging applications. A critical examination of these applications reveals not only the strengths of GNNs but also the persistent challenges and trade-offs inherent in deploying them in complex, real-world settings, such as balancing expressiveness with scalability or ensuring robustness against adversarial manipulations. The continuous evolution of GNN architectures, including non-convolutional approaches like RUM \cite{wang2024oi8} and fractional-order models like FROND \cite{kang2024fsk}, further expands their applicability and addresses previous limitations, paving the way for even broader impact.

\subsection*{7.1. GNNs in Recommender Systems}
Recommender systems are a quintessential application area for GNNs, where the goal is to predict user preferences for items by modeling intricate user-item interactions and leveraging auxiliary information like social networks or item attributes \cite{gao2022f3h, wu2020dc8}. Traditional collaborative filtering methods often struggle with sparsity and cold-start problems, and their ability to capture high-order relationships is limited. GNNs naturally represent user-item interactions as a bipartite graph, allowing for the propagation of preferences and the discovery of latent patterns through message passing \cite{ying20189jc, fan2019k6u}.

Early GNN-based recommender systems, such as PinSage \cite{ying20189jc}, demonstrated significant improvements by learning embeddings for millions of items and users on large-scale graphs. Subsequent advancements have focused on modeling various aspects of recommendation, including session-based recommendations where user behavior sequences are captured as dynamic graphs \cite{wu2018t43, zhang20212ke, zhang2022atq}, and incorporating knowledge graphs to enrich item representations with semantic information \cite{wang2019vol, lyu2023ao0}. The challenge of capturing complex, multi-relational interactions has led to the development of heterogeneous GNNs \cite{wang2019vol} and attention mechanisms \cite{yu2020u32, wang2020khd} to differentiate the importance of various neighbors or relationship types. For instance, \cite{chang2021yyt} and \cite{chang2023ex5} explore GNNs for sequential and bundle recommendations, respectively, highlighting their capacity to model complex dependencies beyond simple pairwise interactions.

Despite their success, GNNs in recommender systems face significant challenges. Scalability to billions of users and items remains a major hurdle, often requiring sampling strategies or distributed training \cite{chen2024gbe, vasimuddin2021x7c}. The inherent homophily assumption of many GNNs can also be problematic in recommendation, as users might interact with diverse items or connect with dissimilar individuals (heterophily) \cite{ma2021sim, li2022315}. While models like GloGNN \cite{li2022315} offer solutions for heterophilous graphs by learning global homophily with linear time complexity, their integration into large-scale industrial recommender systems is still an active research area. Furthermore, the interpretability of GNN recommendations is crucial for user trust and system debugging \cite{lyu2023ao0}, yet explaining complex graph-based decisions remains an open problem. The need for robust evaluation practices, as highlighted by \cite{li2023o4c} for link prediction, is equally critical in recommender systems to ensure fair comparisons and reliable progress.

\subsection*{7.2. Scientific Domains: Molecules, Materials, and Brain Networks}
GNNs have emerged as powerful tools in scientific discovery, particularly in fields dealing with intrinsically graph-structured data such as molecular science, materials discovery, and neuroscience. In **molecular science**, GNNs are revolutionizing drug discovery and chemical property prediction. Molecules are naturally represented as graphs, with atoms as nodes and chemical bonds as edges. GNNs can learn intricate molecular fingerprints, predict properties like toxicity or solubility, and even assist in de novo drug design \cite{jiang2020gaq, carlo2024a3g, yao2024pyk}. Architectures like GemNet \cite{klicpera20215fk} and E(3)-equivariant GNNs \cite{satorras2021pzl, batzner2021t07} are designed to respect the physical symmetries of molecules, leading to more accurate and data-efficient predictions of interatomic potentials and binding affinities \cite{li2021v1l, smith2024q8n}. However, the expressiveness limitations of standard GNNs can hinder their ability to distinguish complex isomers or capture subtle quantum mechanical effects, necessitating more powerful architectures like PathNNs \cite{michel2023hc4} or those leveraging fractional calculus \cite{kang2024fsk}. Pre-training GNNs on large molecular datasets, as explored by Mole-BERT \cite{xia2023bpu}, is also a promising direction to enhance generalization.

Similarly, in **materials discovery**, GNNs are accelerating the design of novel materials with desired properties. Crystal structures, amorphous materials, and alloys can be modeled as graphs, allowing GNNs to predict mechanical, electronic, or thermal properties \cite{reiser2022b08, fung20212kw, maurizi202293p}. They can predict defect formation energies \cite{fang2024zd6} or even model collective variables for molecular dynamics simulations \cite{zhang202483k}. The challenge here lies in handling diverse material compositions and complex interatomic interactions, often requiring equivariant GNNs to maintain physical consistency \cite{batzner2021t07}. The integration of GNNs with large language models (LLMs) is also emerging as a hybrid approach to leverage both structural and textual knowledge for materials property prediction \cite{li2024gue}.

In **brain network analysis**, GNNs offer a novel paradigm for understanding neurological disorders and cognitive functions. The human brain can be represented as a complex network (connectome), where nodes are brain regions and edges represent structural or functional connections \cite{bessadok2021bfy, mohammadi202476q}. GNNs can analyze these networks to classify brain disorders like Alzheimer's disease \cite{cui2022pap, abuhantash202458c, abadal2024w7e}, predict disease progression, or identify biomarkers \cite{zhao2022fvg, luo2024h2k}. The unique challenges in this domain include the small sample sizes of medical datasets, the inherent noise in neuroimaging data, and the need for interpretable models to provide clinical insights \cite{cui2022pap}. Benchmarks like BrainGB \cite{cui2022mjr} are crucial for standardizing evaluation and fostering robust model development. The application of GNNs in this field often requires careful consideration of heterophily, as functionally distinct brain regions might be connected, and the dynamic nature of brain activity necessitates spatio-temporal GNNs \cite{tang2021h2z}.

\subsection*{7.3. Urban Computing, Time Series, and Epidemic Modeling}
GNNs are increasingly vital in **urban computing**, where they tackle complex spatio-temporal prediction tasks essential for smart cities \cite{jin2023e18, rahmani2023kh4}. A prime example is traffic flow forecasting, where road networks form natural graphs, and traffic conditions evolve dynamically \cite{li2020fil, wu2020hi3, zhou2024t2r}. GNNs can capture both the spatial dependencies (e.g., how traffic in one road segment affects adjacent segments) and temporal patterns (e.g., daily commutes, rush hour effects) to provide accurate predictions. Google Maps, for instance, employs GNNs for ETA prediction, demonstrating their real-world impact on navigation and logistics \cite{derrowpinion2021mwn}. However, these applications are highly susceptible to spatio-temporal distribution shifts \cite{zhang2022uih}, where models trained on one city or time period may not generalize well to others, necessitating robust generalization techniques.

The broader field of **time series analysis** also benefits significantly from GNNs, particularly for multivariate time series where inter-series dependencies can be modeled as graphs \cite{jin2023ijy, wu2020hi3}. GNNs are applied to forecasting, classification, imputation (e.g., filling missing data in sensor networks \cite{cini20213l6, jing2024az0}), and anomaly detection in diverse domains, from financial markets \cite{foroutan2024nhg} to industrial IoT \cite{wu20210h4}. The dynamic nature of these relationships often requires GNNs capable of handling temporal graphs \cite{longa202399q, cini2022pjy}. The challenge lies in efficiently learning evolving graph structures and long-range temporal dependencies, which can be addressed by dynamic GNNs or by integrating concepts from fractional calculus to capture memory effects, as proposed by FROND \cite{kang2024fsk}.

In the critical area of **epidemic modeling**, GNNs offer powerful tools for predictive learning in dynamic environments. Infectious disease spread can be modeled as a diffusion process over contact networks, making GNNs well-suited for forecasting disease incidence, identifying high-risk areas, and evaluating intervention strategies \cite{liu20242g6}. Causal-based GNNs, such as CausalGNN \cite{wang202201n}, explicitly model causal relationships in spatio-temporal data to improve epidemic forecasting, demonstrating the capacity of GNNs to move beyond correlation to causality. The dynamic and often uncertain nature of epidemic data, however, poses challenges for model robustness and uncertainty quantification \cite{huang2023fk1}, requiring GNNs that can adapt to rapid changes and provide reliable confidence estimates.

\subsection*{7.4. GNNs in Cybersecurity and Other Emerging Fields}
The growing complexity of cyber threats and interconnected systems has made **cybersecurity** a fertile ground for GNN applications. Networks, system logs, and user behaviors can all be represented as graphs, allowing GNNs to detect anomalies, identify vulnerabilities, and predict attacks \cite{mitra2024x43, bilot20234ui}. For instance, GNNs are used for vulnerability detection in software code by learning program semantics from abstract syntax trees or control flow graphs \cite{zhou20195xo, liu2021qyl, nguyen2021g12, hin2022g19}. They can also classify encrypted network traffic for malicious activity \cite{shen2021sbk, huoh2023i97} or detect financial fraud by analyzing transaction networks \cite{innan2023fa7, duan2024que, zandi2024dgs, liu2024sbb}. The challenge in cybersecurity lies in the adversarial nature of the domain, where attackers can actively try to evade detection by manipulating graph structures or features, necessitating robust and explainable GNNs \cite{mujkanovic20238fi, wang2024p88, xia2024xc9, li2024r82}. The need for explainability is particularly acute in this field, as security analysts require insights into *why* a particular alert was triggered \cite{yuan2021pgd}.

Beyond these major areas, GNNs are making inroads into numerous **other emerging fields**:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Internet of Things (IoT)}: GNNs analyze sensor networks for anomaly detection, resource allocation, and predictive maintenance \cite{dong20225aw, wu20210h4}.

    \item \textbf{Combinatorial Optimization}: GNNs are being explored to learn heuristics or even directly solve NP-hard combinatorial problems, bridging machine learning with operations research \cite{cappart2021xrp, schuetz2021cod}.
    \item \textbf{Natural Language Processing (NLP)}: While often dominated by Transformers, GNNs are used for text classification, relation extraction, and knowledge graph completion by modeling linguistic dependencies \cite{wang2023wrg, zhang2020tdy, wang2020nbg, wu2023zm5, li202444f, wang2024nuq}.
    \item \textbf{Computer Vision}: GNNs are increasingly integrated into computer vision tasks, from object detection and multi-object tracking \cite{wang2021mxw} to point cloud processing \cite{li2024yyl} and scene graph generation \cite{chen2022mmu}.
    \item \textbf{Healthcare and Medical Decision Making}: Beyond brain networks, GNNs are used for drug-drug interaction prediction \cite{gnanabaskaran20245dg}, resource allocation \cite{manivannan2024830}, and customized medical decision algorithms \cite{yan2024ikq}.
    \item \textbf{Earth Observation}: GNNs are being explored for wildfire danger prediction \cite{zhao2024e2x} and other complex spatio-temporal analyses of satellite data \cite{zhao2024g7h}.
\end{itemize}
The pervasive nature of graph-structured data in these diverse fields underscores the broad utility and profound impact of GNNs. The continuous development of more expressive, scalable, and robust GNN architectures will undoubtedly unlock further applications and drive innovation across science, industry, and society.
