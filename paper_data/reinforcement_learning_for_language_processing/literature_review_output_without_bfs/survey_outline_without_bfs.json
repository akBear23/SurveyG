        "subsection_focus": "This subsection looks forward to promising future directions in reinforcement learning for language processing, such as the development of more autonomous and adaptive RL agents, deeper multimodal integration (e.g., vision-language models), and the exploration of RL for complex, real-world decision-making beyond traditional NLP tasks (e.g., urban planning, medical assistance). It discusses the broader societal implications of increasingly capable and aligned language AI, emphasizing the importance of ethical considerations, responsible deployment, and interdisciplinary collaboration to navigate the evolving landscape of human-AI interaction. This includes addressing issues of fairness, accountability, and the long-term impact on human cognition and society.",
