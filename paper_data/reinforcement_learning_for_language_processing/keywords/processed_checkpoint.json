      "abstract": "While large-scale unsupervised language models (LMs) learn broad world knowledge and some reasoning skills, achieving precise control of their behavior is difficult due to the completely unsupervised nature of their training. Existing methods for gaining such steerability collect human labels of the relative quality of model generations and fine-tune the unsupervised LM to align with these preferences, often with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, RLHF is a complex and often unstable procedure, first fitting a reward model that reflects the human preferences, and then fine-tuning the large unsupervised LM using reinforcement learning to maximize this estimated reward without drifting too far from the original model. In this paper we introduce a new parameterization of the reward model in RLHF that enables extraction of the corresponding optimal policy in closed form, allowing us to solve the standard RLHF problem with only a simple classification loss. The resulting algorithm, which we call Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), is stable, performant, and computationally lightweight, eliminating the need for sampling from the LM during fine-tuning or performing significant hyperparameter tuning. Our experiments show that DPO can fine-tune LMs to align with human preferences as well as or better than existing methods. Notably, fine-tuning with DPO exceeds PPO-based RLHF in ability to control sentiment of generations, and matches or improves response quality in summarization and single-turn dialogue while being substantially simpler to implement and train.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is widely used in Large Language Model (LLM) alignment. Traditional RL can be modeled as a dataflow, where each node represents computation of a neural network (NN) and each edge denotes data dependencies between the NNs. RLHF complicates the dataflow by expanding each node into a distributed LLM training or generation program, and each edge into a many-to-many multicast. Traditional RL frameworks execute the dataflow using a single controller to instruct both intra-node computation and inter-node communication, which can be inefficient in RLHF due to large control dispatch overhead for distributed intra-node computation. Existing RLHF systems adopt a multi-controller paradigm, which can be inflexible due to nesting distributed computation and data communication. We propose HybridFlow, which combines single-controller and multi-controller paradigms in a hybrid manner to enable flexible representation and efficient execution of the RLHF data flow. We carefully design a set of hierarchical APIs that decouple and encapsulate computation and data dependencies in the complex RLHF dataflow, allowing efficient operation orchestration to implement RLHF algorithms and flexible mapping of the computation onto various devices. We further design a 3D-HybridEngine for efficient actor model resharding between training and generation phases, with zero memory redundancy and significantly reduced communication overhead.

      "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper \\cite{sheng2024sf5} for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the inefficiency and inflexibility of existing frameworks for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in Large Language Model (LLM) alignment.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: RLHF dataflows are highly complex, involving multiple LLMs (actor, critic, reference, reward models) with distinct, distributed computation requirements (training, inference, generation) and diverse parallelism strategies (data, pipeline, tensor parallelism). Traditional single-controller RL frameworks incur high dispatch overhead for distributed LLM computation, while existing multi-controller RLHF systems are inflexible due to tightly coupled (nested) distributed computation and data communication, hindering code reuse and optimization. The heterogeneous workloads and unbalanced computation between actor training and generation further complicate efficient execution and resource management.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Traditional RL Frameworks (e.g., RLLib, RLLib Flow)**: Utilize a hierarchical single-controller paradigm.\n        *   **Limitations**: Inefficient for large LLMs (billions of operators) due to substantial dispatch overhead when coordinating distributed accelerators, and primarily provide primitives for data-parallel training of smaller neural networks.\n    *   **Existing RLHF Systems**: Adopt a multi-controller paradigm.\n        *   **Limitations**: While offering negligible dispatch overhead for LLM computation, they are inflexible. Implementing various RLHF dataflows requires intricate integration of collective communication, computation, and point-to-point data transfer, leading to deeply nested code that is challenging to develop, maintain, and optimize. Modifying one node often necessitates changes in all dependent nodes.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: \\cite{sheng2024sf5} proposes **HybridFlow**, a framework that combines single-controller and multi-controller paradigms in a hybrid manner. It uses a single-controller at the inter-node level for flexible dataflow expression and coordination, and a multi-controller paradigm within intra-node computation for efficiency.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   **Hierarchical Hybrid Programming Model**: Decouples and encapsulates computation and data dependencies. At the node level, it provides model classes that encapsulate distributed LLM computation (training, inference, generation) using a multi-controller paradigm, supporting various parallelism strategies (3D parallelism, ZeRO, PyTorch FSDP). At the inter-node level, a single controller coordinates data resharding through designed transfer protocols, abstracting complexity from users.\n        *   **3D-HybridEngine**: A specialized engine designed for efficient execution of actor model training and generation. It enables zero memory redundancy and significantly reduced communication overhead during model parameter resharding between these two distinct stages.\n        *   **Optimized GPU Allocation Algorithm**: Facilitates flexible placement of models onto the same or different sets of GPU devices and automatically identifies optimized GPU allocation and placement for heterogeneous models and workloads.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**: A hierarchical hybrid programming model that combines the flexibility of single-controller inter-node coordination with the efficiency of multi-controller intra-node distributed LLM computation.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: The **3D-HybridEngine** for efficient, zero-redundancy transition and resharding of actor models between training and generation phases. A set of hierarchical APIs and transfer protocols that abstract distributed computing complexity.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: An effective mapping algorithm for automatic and optimized GPU allocation and placement of diverse models within the RLHF dataflow.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Extensive experiments were performed comparing HybridFlow with state-of-the-art RLHF systems (e.g., [17, 30, 82] mentioned in the paper's context) across various RLHF algorithms (PPO, Safe-RLHF, ReMax), different model sizes, and cluster scales.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**: Throughput improvement.\n    *   **Comparison Results**: HybridFlow demonstrated significant throughput improvements ranging from **1.53× to 20.57×** compared to the baselines.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The paper primarily focuses on the *framework* and *execution efficiency* of RLHF, assuming the underlying RLHF algorithms are given. It does not delve into novel RLHF algorithmic developments or address fundamental challenges related to RLHF stability or convergence. The efficiency gains are tied to the specific architectural choices and optimizations for LLM distributed training/inference.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: HybridFlow is designed for accelerating and simplifying the implementation and execution of diverse RLHF algorithms for LLM alignment. Its applicability is within the domain of distributed LLM training and fine-tuning using human feedback, particularly where heterogeneous model workloads and dynamic parallelism strategies are required.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: HybridFlow significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in RLHF frameworks by providing a flexible, efficient, and user-friendly solution that overcomes the limitations of both traditional single-controller and existing multi-controller paradigms. Its hybrid approach effectively manages the complexity of distributed LLM operations and data dependencies.\n    *   **Potential Impact**: By offering substantial throughput improvements and simplifying the development of complex RLHF workflows, HybridFlow can accelerate research and development in LLM alignment, making it easier for researchers and practitioners to experiment with and deploy novel RLHF algorithms. The open-sourcing of HybridFlow further contributes to its potential for widespread adoption and impact on future RLHF advancements.",

Related Work & Positioning\n*   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** This work builds upon the success of LLMs in high-level planning for robotics \\cite{ma2023vyo} and the impressive results of RL in dexterity when well-designed rewards are available \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n*   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n    *   Prior LLM attempts for low-level tasks either require substantial domain expertise and task-specific prompting or only learn simple skills, failing to achieve human-level dexterity \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n    *   Manual reward engineering is prone to sub-optimality and unintended behavior \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n    *   Previous LLM-aided reward design methods, like L2R \\cite{ma2023vyo}, rely on task-specific prompts, reward templates, and predefined API primitives, which limit their expressivity, generality, and performance on complex tasks \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n\n### 3. Technical Approach & Innovation\n*   **Core Technical Method:** EUREKA is a novel reward design algorithm powered by coding LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) that performs evolutionary optimization over reward code \\cite{ma2023vyo}. It generates executable reward functions that can then be used to acquire complex skills via RL \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n*   **Novelty/Differentiation:**\n    *   EUREKA operates without any task-specific prompting, pre-defined reward templates, or few-shot examples, making it highly generalizable \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n    *   It leverages the LLM's zero-shot generation, code-writing, and in-context improvement capabilities for reward code evolution \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n    *   The approach integrates three key algorithmic design choices: \"environment as context,\" \"evolutionary search,\" and \"reward reflection\" \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n\n### 4. Key Technical Contributions\n*   **Novel Algorithms, Methods, or Techniques:**\n    *   **Environment as Context:** EUREKA directly feeds the raw environment source code (excluding reward code) to the LLM as context, enabling zero-shot generation of executable Python reward functions. An automated script extracts relevant code snippets to manage context window size and prevent simulator internals leakage \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n    *   **Evolutionary Search:** The algorithm iteratively samples batches of reward candidates from the LLM and refines the most promising ones through in-context reward mutation. This process effectively addresses initial execution errors and sub-optimality \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n    *   **Reward Reflection:** An automated textual feedback mechanism summarizes policy training dynamics by tracking scalar values of individual reward components and the task fitness function at intermediate checkpoints. This provides fine-grained credit assignment, enabling targeted and intricate reward editing by the LLM, overcoming the limitations of a single, holistic fitness score \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n    *   **Gradient-Free In-Context Learning for RLHF:** EUREKA enables a new approach to RL from human feedback, allowing the incorporation of various human inputs (e.g., existing human rewards, textual feedback) to improve reward quality and safety without requiring model updating or retraining \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n*   **System Design or Architectural Innovations:**\n    *   EUREKA integrates GPU-accelerated distributed reinforcement learning (using IsaacGym) for efficient evaluation of intermediate reward functions, allowing the extensive reward search to scale with computational resources \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n\n### 5. Experimental Validation\n*   **Experiments Conducted:**\n    *   Evaluated on a diverse suite of 29 open-source RL environments, encompassing 10 distinct robot morphologies (quadruped, biped, quadrotor, manipulators, dexterous hands), including 9 IsaacGym tasks and 20 Bidexterous Manipulation (Dexterity) tasks \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n    *   Compared EUREKA's performance against expert human-engineered rewards, L2R (a prior LLM-based method), and sparse rewards \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n    *   Demonstrated the first simulated Shadow Hand capable of rapid pen spinning tricks by combining EUREKA rewards with curriculum learning \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n    *   Showcased the ability to improve upon existing human reward functions and generate progressively more human-aligned rewards using purely textual feedback \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n    *   Ablation studies were conducted comparing GPT-4 with GPT-3.5 as the backbone LLM \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n*   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results:**\n    *   EUREKA outperformed expert human-engineered rewards on 83% of the tasks, achieving an average normalized improvement of 52% \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n    *   It significantly surpassed L2R, particularly on high-dimensional dexterity environments, attributed to its ability to generate free-form, expressive reward programs \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n    *   Successfully enabled complex dexterous manipulation tasks like pen spinning, which were previously infeasible with manual reward engineering \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n    *   Demonstrated effective integration of human feedback to produce more performant and human-aligned reward functions \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n    *   GPT-4 consistently yielded better performance than GPT-3.5, highlighting the reliance on advanced LLM capabilities \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n\n### 6. Limitations & Scope\n*   **Technical Limitations or Assumptions:**\n    *   Relies on the capabilities of state-of-the-art coding LLMs (e.g., GPT-4); performance degrades with less capable models \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n    *   Requires access to environment source code or an API that exposes relevant state and action variables \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n    *   The effectiveness of reward reflection is predicated on the reward function exposing its individual components \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n    *   The evolutionary search process, while efficient due to GPU acceleration, still involves multiple LLM interactions and RL training runs, implying a computational cost \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n*   **Scope of Applicability:**\n    *   Applicable across a broad spectrum of RL tasks and robot morphologies, particularly effective for complex, high-dimensional dexterous manipulation \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n    *   Can be used for fully automated reward design, as well as for human-in-the-loop refinement and alignment of rewards (RLHF) \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n    *   Demonstrated utility in curriculum learning settings for acquiring advanced skills \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n\n### 7. Technical Significance\n*   **Advances the Technical State-of-the-Art:** EUREKA represents a significant advancement by bridging the gap between LLM high-level planning and complex low-level manipulation, demonstrating that LLMs can design human-level, and even superhuman, reward functions for challenging dexterous tasks \\cite{ma2023vyo}. It moves beyond templated reward generation to free-form, expressive reward programming \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n*   **Potential Impact on Future Research:**\n    *   Automates and streamlines the notoriously difficult reward design process, making complex RL tasks more accessible and accelerating research in areas like robot dexterity \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n    *   Unlocks the ability to acquire previously infeasible dexterous manipulation skills in simulation, paving the way for real-world applications \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n    *   Introduces a novel, gradient-free RLHF approach that allows flexible and efficient incorporation of human expertise and feedback into reward design without requiring extensive model retraining \\cite{ma2023vyo}.\n    *   The open-sourcing of prompts, environments, and generated rewards will foster further research and development in LLM-based reward design \\cite{ma2023vyo}.",

This dependence leads to high costs, potential issues with annotation quality, reliability, diversity, self-consistency, and undesirable biases, significantly constraining the true potential of AI agents.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**:\n        *   **SFT & RLHF (e.g., InstructGPT, ChatGPT)**: These methods are the dominant paradigm but require massive human supervision (tens to hundreds of thousands of annotations). `\\cite{sun20238m7}` aims to drastically reduce this dependency.\n        *   **Self-Instruct (e.g., Alpaca)**: While reducing human effort for instruction generation, these models still rely on distilling knowledge from *already aligned* LLMs (like Text-Davinci-003 or ChatGPT), indirectly inheriting their dependence on extensive human supervision. `\\cite{sun20238m7}` focuses on alignment \"from scratch,\" independent of existing well-aligned LLMs.\n        *   **Constitutional AI (CAI)**: Both `SELF-ALIGN` and CAI are rule-based. However, CAI uses a self-critique methodology where the model scrutinizes and refines existing responses based on rules, often requiring an RLHF warm-up. `\\cite{sun20238m7}`'s `Principle-Driven Self-Alignment` involves the LLM determining which rules to follow *before* generating a response and aims for alignment from scratch without RLHF warm-up.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   High cost and scalability issues due to extensive human annotation requirements.\n        *   Potential for quality, reliability, diversity, and bias issues in human-provided data.\n        *   Reliance on pre-existing, extensively human-aligned LLMs for distillation-based approaches.\n        *   CAI's self-critique nature necessitates RLHF warm-up, which `\\cite{sun20238m7}` seeks to avoid for \"from scratch\" alignment.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: `SELF-ALIGN` is a novel four-stage process for self-alignment of LLMs with minimal human supervision, combining principle-driven reasoning and LLM generative power.\n        1.  **Topic-Guided Red-Teaming Self-Instruct**: Extends the Self-Instruct mechanism by generating synthetic instructions with enhanced diversity and coverage through topic-guided adversarial instruction types (e.g., questions requiring future knowledge, legal expertise).\n        2.  **Principle-Driven Self-Alignment**: Provides the LLM with a small set of 16 human-written principles (e.g., ethical, informative, helpful) and 5 in-context learning (ICL) exemplars. The LLM uses these principles and \"internal thoughts\" to guide its response generation, ensuring adherence to desired behaviors.\n        3.  **Principle Engraving**: Fine-tunes the base LLM on the self-aligned responses generated in the previous stage, *pruning* the explicit principles and demonstrations. This enables the model to directly generate aligned responses without needing the principles in the prompt for new queries.\n        4.  **Verbose Cloning**: Employs context distillation to refine the model's capability to produce more comprehensive and elaborate responses, addressing overly short or indirect outputs.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   **Minimal Human Supervision**: Achieves alignment with fewer than 300 lines of human annotations (195 seed prompts, 16 principles, 5 exemplars), drastically less than previous methods (e.g., 50K+ for Alpaca/InstructGPT).\n        *   **Alignment from Scratch**: Focuses on aligning base LLMs without relying on or distilling from existing extensively human-aligned models (like ChatGPT or Text-Davinci-003).\n        *   **Principle-Driven Prompting**: Explicitly uses human-defined principles and ICL demonstrations to guide the LLM's internal reasoning and response generation during the self-alignment phase.\n        *   **Principle Engraving**: A unique fine-tuning step that internalizes the principles into the model's parameters, removing the need for explicit prompting with principles during inference.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**: The `SELF-ALIGN` four-stage pipeline, particularly the `Principle-Driven Self-Alignment` and `Principle Engraving` stages, which enable efficient, rule-based alignment.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: A framework for aligning LLMs with human values using minimal human supervision, demonstrating a viable alternative to heavily human-annotated or distillation-based approaches.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: Demonstrates the feasibility of aligning powerful LLMs \"from scratch\" using a small set of human-defined principles and self-generated data, challenging the necessity of massive human feedback for alignment.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Applied `SELF-ALIGN` to the LLaMA-65b base language model to develop an AI assistant named Dromedary.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results**:\n        *   Dromedary, trained with <300 lines of human annotations, significantly surpasses the performance of several state-of-the-art AI systems, including Text-Davinci-003 and Alpaca, on benchmark datasets across various settings.\n        *   The paper highlights the supervision efficiency, showing orders of magnitude reduction in human annotation requirements compared to SFT/RLHF and distillation-based methods.\n    *   **Open-Sourcing**: The code, LoRA weights of Dromedary, and synthetic training data are open-sourced to foster further research.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**: One limitation of `SELF-ALIGN` is the requirement to include all rules within the context during the `Principle-Driven Self-Alignment` stage, which is bound by the base language model’s token limit. This contrasts with CAI, which, as a post-generation self-critique method, is not subject to this constraint.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: Primarily focuses on aligning LLMs for AI assistant agents to be helpful, ethical, and reliable. The design of the principles is exploratory and serves research purposes. The approach is specifically designed for \"from scratch\" alignment, independent of existing well-aligned LLMs.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: `\\cite{sun20238m7}` significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by demonstrating a highly supervision-efficient method for aligning LLMs. It offers a paradigm shift from human-intensive feedback to principle-driven self-alignment, making LLM alignment more accessible and less costly.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n        *   Opens new avenues for research into AI alignment techniques that are less dependent on human supervision, potentially leading to more scalable and less biased alignment processes.\n        *   Encourages exploration of rule-based and self-improvement mechanisms for LLMs, broadening the understanding of how to develop more responsible and controllable AI systems.\n        *   Facilitates the development of open-source, aligned LLMs without proprietary dependencies on large, pre-aligned models.",

      "abstract": "Recent AI-assistant agents, such as ChatGPT, predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human annotations and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align the output of large language models (LLMs) with human intentions, ensuring they are helpful, ethical, and reliable. However, this dependence can significantly constrain the true potential of AI-assistant agents due to the high cost of obtaining human supervision and the related issues on quality, reliability, diversity, self-consistency, and undesirable biases. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called SELF-ALIGN, which combines principle-driven reasoning and the generative power of LLMs for the self-alignment of AI agents with minimal human supervision. Our approach encompasses four stages: first, we use an LLM to generate synthetic prompts, and a topic-guided method to augment the prompt diversity; second, we use a small set of human-written principles for AI models to follow, and guide the LLM through in-context learning from demonstrations (of principles application) to produce helpful, ethical, and reliable responses to user's queries; third, we fine-tune the original LLM with the high-quality self-aligned responses so that the resulting model can generate desirable responses for each query directly without the principle set and the demonstrations anymore; and finally, we offer a refinement step to address the issues of overly-brief or indirect responses. Applying SELF-ALIGN to the LLaMA-65b base language model, we develop an AI assistant named Dromedary. With fewer than 300 lines of human annotations (including<200 seed prompts, 16 generic principles, and 5 exemplars for in-context learning). Dromedary significantly surpasses the performance of several state-of-the-art AI systems, including Text-Davinci-003 and Alpaca, on benchmark datasets with various settings.",

This dependence leads to high costs, potential issues with annotation quality, reliability, diversity, self-consistency, and undesirable biases, significantly constraining the true potential of AI agents.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**:\n        *   **SFT & RLHF (e.g., InstructGPT, ChatGPT)**: These methods are the dominant paradigm but require massive human supervision (tens to hundreds of thousands of annotations). `\\cite{sun20238m7}` aims to drastically reduce this dependency.\n        *   **Self-Instruct (e.g., Alpaca)**: While reducing human effort for instruction generation, these models still rely on distilling knowledge from *already aligned* LLMs (like Text-Davinci-003 or ChatGPT), indirectly inheriting their dependence on extensive human supervision. `\\cite{sun20238m7}` focuses on alignment \"from scratch,\" independent of existing well-aligned LLMs.\n        *   **Constitutional AI (CAI)**: Both `SELF-ALIGN` and CAI are rule-based. However, CAI uses a self-critique methodology where the model scrutinizes and refines existing responses based on rules, often requiring an RLHF warm-up. `\\cite{sun20238m7}`'s `Principle-Driven Self-Alignment` involves the LLM determining which rules to follow *before* generating a response and aims for alignment from scratch without RLHF warm-up.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   High cost and scalability issues due to extensive human annotation requirements.\n        *   Potential for quality, reliability, diversity, and bias issues in human-provided data.\n        *   Reliance on pre-existing, extensively human-aligned LLMs for distillation-based approaches.\n        *   CAI's self-critique nature necessitates RLHF warm-up, which `\\cite{sun20238m7}` seeks to avoid for \"from scratch\" alignment.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: `SELF-ALIGN` is a novel four-stage process for self-alignment of LLMs with minimal human supervision, combining principle-driven reasoning and LLM generative power.\n        1.  **Topic-Guided Red-Teaming Self-Instruct**: Extends the Self-Instruct mechanism by generating synthetic instructions with enhanced diversity and coverage through topic-guided adversarial instruction types (e.g., questions requiring future knowledge, legal expertise).\n        2.  **Principle-Driven Self-Alignment**: Provides the LLM with a small set of 16 human-written principles (e.g., ethical, informative, helpful) and 5 in-context learning (ICL) exemplars. The LLM uses these principles and \"internal thoughts\" to guide its response generation, ensuring adherence to desired behaviors.\n        3.  **Principle Engraving**: Fine-tunes the base LLM on the self-aligned responses generated in the previous stage, *pruning* the explicit principles and demonstrations. This enables the model to directly generate aligned responses without needing the principles in the prompt for new queries.\n        4.  **Verbose Cloning**: Employs context distillation to refine the model's capability to produce more comprehensive and elaborate responses, addressing overly short or indirect outputs.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   **Minimal Human Supervision**: Achieves alignment with fewer than 300 lines of human annotations (195 seed prompts, 16 principles, 5 exemplars), drastically less than previous methods (e.g., 50K+ for Alpaca/InstructGPT).\n        *   **Alignment from Scratch**: Focuses on aligning base LLMs without relying on or distilling from existing extensively human-aligned models (like ChatGPT or Text-Davinci-003).\n        *   **Principle-Driven Prompting**: Explicitly uses human-defined principles and ICL demonstrations to guide the LLM's internal reasoning and response generation during the self-alignment phase.\n        *   **Principle Engraving**: A unique fine-tuning step that internalizes the principles into the model's parameters, removing the need for explicit prompting with principles during inference.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**: The `SELF-ALIGN` four-stage pipeline, particularly the `Principle-Driven Self-Alignment` and `Principle Engraving` stages, which enable efficient, rule-based alignment.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: A framework for aligning LLMs with human values using minimal human supervision, demonstrating a viable alternative to heavily human-annotated or distillation-based approaches.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: Demonstrates the feasibility of aligning powerful LLMs \"from scratch\" using a small set of human-defined principles and self-generated data, challenging the necessity of massive human feedback for alignment.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Applied `SELF-ALIGN` to the LLaMA-65b base language model to develop an AI assistant named Dromedary.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results**:\n        *   Dromedary, trained with <300 lines of human annotations, significantly surpasses the performance of several state-of-the-art AI systems, including Text-Davinci-003 and Alpaca, on benchmark datasets across various settings.\n        *   The paper highlights the supervision efficiency, showing orders of magnitude reduction in human annotation requirements compared to SFT/RLHF and distillation-based methods.\n    *   **Open-Sourcing**: The code, LoRA weights of Dromedary, and synthetic training data are open-sourced to foster further research.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**: One limitation of `SELF-ALIGN` is the requirement to include all rules within the context during the `Principle-Driven Self-Alignment` stage, which is bound by the base language model’s token limit. This contrasts with CAI, which, as a post-generation self-critique method, is not subject to this constraint.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: Primarily focuses on aligning LLMs for AI assistant agents to be helpful, ethical, and reliable. The design of the principles is exploratory and serves research purposes. The approach is specifically designed for \"from scratch\" alignment, independent of existing well-aligned LLMs.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: `\\cite{sun20238m7}` significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by demonstrating a highly supervision-efficient method for aligning LLMs. It offers a paradigm shift from human-intensive feedback to principle-driven self-alignment, making LLM alignment more accessible and less costly.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n        *   Opens new avenues for research into AI alignment techniques that are less dependent on human supervision, potentially leading to more scalable and less biased alignment processes.\n        *   Encourages exploration of rule-based and self-improvement mechanisms for LLMs, broadening the understanding of how to develop more responsible and controllable AI systems.\n        *   Facilitates the development of open-source, aligned LLMs without proprietary dependencies on large, pre-aligned models.",

Existing popular methods (e.g., offline PPO, offline DPO) are identified as lacking strategical exploration of the environment \\cite{xiong2023klt}.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: RLHF implementations often rely on ad-hoc practices, extensive tuning, and suffer from \"alignment tax\" or performance degeneration due to imperfect reward models (bias, approximation errors, reward hacking).

Applying RL to reasoning tasks is a natural next step given RL's success in complex planning (e.g., AlphaGo). The challenge lies in understanding which RL algorithms, reward schemes (sparse vs. dense, heuristic vs. learned), and model initializations (pretrained vs. SFT) are most effective for enhancing reasoning, and why.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: This work builds upon the success of RLHF for LLM alignment and draws inspiration from RL's application in game environments for sophisticated planning. It relates to existing LLM reasoning techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT), and methods combining LLMs with planning/search algorithms or external tools. It also connects to prior work on Outcome-Based Reward Models (ORMs) and Process-Based Reward Models (PRMs) for evaluating reasoning steps.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: While RLHF often uses PPO, and various forms of expert iteration have been applied to LLM reasoning, a comprehensive analysis comparing different RL algorithms, reward types, model sizes, and initializations specifically for *reasoning tasks* was lacking. Previous work often showed varied results, making it unclear which factors were most impactful. For instance, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) can exhibit a trade-off between `maj@1` and `pass@96` scores, a limitation this work aims to overcome with RL.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method/Algorithm**: The paper systematically compares three representative RL algorithms for fine-tuning LLMs on reasoning tasks:\n        *   **Expert Iteration (EI)**: An online, more off-policy method where an initial expert policy is sampled, high-return rollouts are filtered and de-duplicated, and then distilled back into a policy via standard cross-entropy loss. This process can be iterated.\n        *   **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: An online, on-policy algorithm that updates the policy by directly maximizing for reward using an advantage estimate, often used in RLHF.\n        *   **Return-Conditioned RL (RCRL)**: An offline approach similar to a decision transformer, where policies are trained to predict actions conditioned on the current state and a desired return.\n    *   **Reward Schemes**: Experiments utilize various reward types:\n        *   **Sparse Reward**: +1 for a correct final answer, 0 otherwise.\n        *   **Dense Reward**: Matches intermediate steps in a reference solution.\n        *   **Learned Reward Model (ORM)**: An Outcome-Based Reward Model (ORM) is trained to predict the probability of a correct final answer given intermediate steps, and its scores are used as rewards.\n    *   **Model Initializations**: Models are initialized from both supervised fine-tuned (SFT) checkpoints and pretrained base models (Llama-2 7B and 13B).\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**: The primary innovation is the *comprehensive and systematic comparative study* of these diverse RL algorithms and reward schemes for improving LLM reasoning. This includes analyzing their performance, sample complexity, and the impact of different initializations, leading to insights into the underlying mechanisms (e.g., exploration limitations). The finding that model resetting (training from pretrained base model after generating data with SFT checkpoint) is crucial for EI and RCRL is also a practical innovation.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Comprehensive Study**: A thorough investigation of PPO, Expert Iteration, and Return-Conditioned RL for fine-tuning LLMs on reasoning tasks, considering different reward types (sparse, dense, ORM-based), model sizes (7B, 13B), and initializations (SFT, pretrained).\n    *   **Algorithm Performance & Sample Complexity Analysis**: Empirically demonstrates that Expert Iteration (EI) reliably achieves the best performance across most reward setups and model initializations, with surprisingly competitive sample complexity (on the order of 10^6 samples) similar to PPO.\n    *   **Identification of Exploration as a Limiting Factor**: Concludes that during RL training, models often fail to explore significantly beyond solutions already produced by SFT models, which limits the potential advantages of algorithms like PPO, especially in deterministic reasoning environments. This is supported by observations like quickly saturating `pass@96` scores.\n    *   **Simultaneous Improvement of `maj@1` and `pass@96`**: Shows that RL fine-tuning can simultaneously improve both `maj@1` (greedy accuracy) and `pass@96` (best of K samples) metrics, unlike continued SFT training which often exhibits a trade-off due to limited dataset diversity. RL's ability to generate its own diverse data during training is identified as the reason.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**:\n        *   Evaluations on two math word problem benchmarks: GSM8K and SVAMP.\n        *   Experiments conducted with Llama-2 7B and 13B models.\n        *   Two data regimes for GSM8K: with and without SFT data.\n        *   Comparison of EI, PPO (sparse, dense, ORM-guided), and RCRL.\n        *   Analysis of sample complexity for EI and PPO.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**:\n        *   `maj@1`: Greedy sampling accuracy.\n        *   `maj@96`: Majority vote accuracy from 96 samples.\n        *   `rerank@96`: Accuracy after reranking 96 samples using an ORM.\n        *   `pass@96`: Best of 96 samples accuracy (using ground truth).\n    *   **Comparison Results**:\n        *   **EI Outperformance**: EI consistently achieved the best performance, e.g., improving `maj@1` by ~7% over the SFT baseline for both 7B and 13B models.\n        *   **Competitive Sample Complexity**: EI was found to be nearly as sample-efficient as PPO, requiring only a few thousand samples to converge even from a pretrained checkpoint (on the order of 10^6 total samples).\n        *   **PPO Underperformance**: PPO models generally underperformed EI, with ORM-guided PPO showing the largest improvement among PPO variants (~5% over SFT baseline).\n        *   **RCRL Underperformance**: RCRL models underperformed EI despite training on EI-generated data.\n        *   **SFT vs. RL Trade-off Resolution**: RL fine-tuning was shown to improve both `maj@1` and `pass@96` simultaneously, addressing a trade-off observed during SFT training.\n        *   **Impact of Initialization**: The gap between pretrained and SFT model performance significantly shrinks after RL fine-tuning, with larger models showing a smaller gap. Resetting training to the pretrained base model for EI and RCRL (after data generation with SFT) was found to be crucial.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**:\n        *   The reasoning tasks considered (math word problems) have entirely deterministic dynamics, which might favor direct behavior cloning methods like EI and RCRL over PPO, which often excels in stochastic environments.\n        *   A significant limitation identified is the lack of sophisticated exploration by models during RL fine-tuning, which restricts the potential gains from RL, particularly for PPO.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The findings are primarily demonstrated on math word problem benchmarks (GSM8K, SVAMP) using Llama-2 models. While the insights about exploration and algorithm comparison are general, their direct applicability to highly stochastic or open-ended reasoning tasks might require further investigation.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: This paper provides crucial empirical evidence and analysis for the effective application of RL to LLM reasoning. It challenges the common assumption that complex online RL algorithms like PPO are always superior, demonstrating that simpler methods like Expert Iteration can achieve better performance with comparable sample efficiency in deterministic reasoning contexts.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n        *   **RLHF Implications**: The findings suggest that the choice of RL algorithm in RLHF might be less critical than previously thought, especially if the underlying task dynamics are deterministic or if exploration is limited.\n        *   **Focus on Exploration**: The identification of limited exploration as a major bottleneck highlights a critical area for future research in LLM fine-tuning via RL. Developing more sophisticated exploration strategies for LLMs in reasoning tasks could unlock significant performance gains.\n        *   **Rethinking RL for LLMs**: The work encourages a re-evaluation of the role and choice of RL algorithms for LLM fine-tuning, suggesting that simpler, more off-policy methods might be highly effective, particularly when combined with strategies that enhance data diversity.",
    "intriguing_abstract": "Unlocking advanced reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, with Reinforcement Learning (RL) holding immense promise. This paper presents a comprehensive, systematic investigation into applying diverse RL algorithms—Expert Iteration (EI), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Return-Conditioned RL (RCRL)—to enhance LLM reasoning on benchmarks like GSM8K. We meticulously compare their efficacy across various reward schemes (sparse, dense, learned Outcome-Based Reward Models) and model initializations (SFT, pretrained Llama-2 7B/13B).\n\nOur findings reveal that Expert Iteration consistently outperforms other methods, achieving significant gains (e.g., ~7% `maj@1` improvement) with surprisingly competitive sample complexity. Crucially, we identify a pervasive limitation: LLMs exhibit restricted exploration during RL fine-tuning, often failing to generate novel reasoning paths beyond supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data. This bottleneck, particularly impacting PPO, suggests that the choice of RL algorithm might be less critical than the need for sophisticated exploration strategies. Furthermore, RL fine-tuning simultaneously improves both greedy accuracy (`maj@1`) and solution diversity (`pass@96`), resolving a common SFT trade-off. This work re-evaluates RL's role in LLM reasoning, emphasizing exploration as a key frontier for future research and informing more effective RLHF strategies.",

Inspired by the success of RLHF, we study the performance of multiple algorithms that learn from feedback (Expert Iteration, Proximal Policy Optimization (\\textbf{PPO}), Return-Conditioned RL) on improving LLM reasoning capabilities. We investigate both sparse and dense rewards provided to the LLM both heuristically and via a learned reward model. We additionally start from multiple model sizes and initializations both with and without supervised fine-tuning (\\textbf{SFT}) data. Overall, we find all algorithms perform comparably, with Expert Iteration performing best in most cases. Surprisingly, we find the sample complexity of Expert Iteration is similar to that of PPO, requiring at most on the order of $10^6$ samples to converge from a pretrained checkpoint. We investigate why this is the case, concluding that during RL training models fail to explore significantly beyond solutions already produced by SFT models. Additionally, we discuss a trade off between maj@1 and pass@96 metric performance during SFT training and how conversely RL training improves both simultaneously. We then conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for RLHF and the future role of RL in LLM fine-tuning.",

      "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \\cite{havrilla2024m0y} for a literature review, emphasizing technical innovations and empirical validation:\n\n### Technical Paper Analysis: Teaching Large Language Models to Reason with Reinforcement Learning \\cite{havrilla2024m0y}\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses how to effectively improve the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) using Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: LLM reasoning abilities are rapidly advancing, and RL from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown success in aligning LLMs with human preferences. Applying RL to reasoning tasks is a natural next step given RL's success in complex planning (e.g., AlphaGo). The challenge lies in understanding which RL algorithms, reward schemes (sparse vs. dense, heuristic vs. learned), and model initializations (pretrained vs. SFT) are most effective for enhancing reasoning, and why.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: This work builds upon the success of RLHF for LLM alignment and draws inspiration from RL's application in game environments for sophisticated planning. It relates to existing LLM reasoning techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT), and methods combining LLMs with planning/search algorithms or external tools. It also connects to prior work on Outcome-Based Reward Models (ORMs) and Process-Based Reward Models (PRMs) for evaluating reasoning steps.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: While RLHF often uses PPO, and various forms of expert iteration have been applied to LLM reasoning, a comprehensive analysis comparing different RL algorithms, reward types, model sizes, and initializations specifically for *reasoning tasks* was lacking. Previous work often showed varied results, making it unclear which factors were most impactful. For instance, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) can exhibit a trade-off between `maj@1` and `pass@96` scores, a limitation this work aims to overcome with RL.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method/Algorithm**: The paper systematically compares three representative RL algorithms for fine-tuning LLMs on reasoning tasks:\n        *   **Expert Iteration (EI)**: An online, more off-policy method where an initial expert policy is sampled, high-return rollouts are filtered and de-duplicated, and then distilled back into a policy via standard cross-entropy loss. This process can be iterated.\n        *   **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: An online, on-policy algorithm that updates the policy by directly maximizing for reward using an advantage estimate, often used in RLHF.\n        *   **Return-Conditioned RL (RCRL)**: An offline approach similar to a decision transformer, where policies are trained to predict actions conditioned on the current state and a desired return.\n    *   **Reward Schemes**: Experiments utilize various reward types:\n        *   **Sparse Reward**: +1 for a correct final answer, 0 otherwise.\n        *   **Dense Reward**: Matches intermediate steps in a reference solution.\n        *   **Learned Reward Model (ORM)**: An Outcome-Based Reward Model (ORM) is trained to predict the probability of a correct final answer given intermediate steps, and its scores are used as rewards.\n    *   **Model Initializations**: Models are initialized from both supervised fine-tuned (SFT) checkpoints and pretrained base models (Llama-2 7B and 13B).\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**: The primary innovation is the *comprehensive and systematic comparative study* of these diverse RL algorithms and reward schemes for improving LLM reasoning. This includes analyzing their performance, sample complexity, and the impact of different initializations, leading to insights into the underlying mechanisms (e.g., exploration limitations). The finding that model resetting (training from pretrained base model after generating data with SFT checkpoint) is crucial for EI and RCRL is also a practical innovation.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Comprehensive Study**: A thorough investigation of PPO, Expert Iteration, and Return-Conditioned RL for fine-tuning LLMs on reasoning tasks, considering different reward types (sparse, dense, ORM-based), model sizes (7B, 13B), and initializations (SFT, pretrained).\n    *   **Algorithm Performance & Sample Complexity Analysis**: Empirically demonstrates that Expert Iteration (EI) reliably achieves the best performance across most reward setups and model initializations, with surprisingly competitive sample complexity (on the order of 10^6 samples) similar to PPO.\n    *   **Identification of Exploration as a Limiting Factor**: Concludes that during RL training, models often fail to explore significantly beyond solutions already produced by SFT models, which limits the potential advantages of algorithms like PPO, especially in deterministic reasoning environments. This is supported by observations like quickly saturating `pass@96` scores.\n    *   **Simultaneous Improvement of `maj@1` and `pass@96`**: Shows that RL fine-tuning can simultaneously improve both `maj@1` (greedy accuracy) and `pass@96` (best of K samples) metrics, unlike continued SFT training which often exhibits a trade-off due to limited dataset diversity. RL's ability to generate its own diverse data during training is identified as the reason.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**:\n        *   Evaluations on two math word problem benchmarks: GSM8K and SVAMP.\n        *   Experiments conducted with Llama-2 7B and 13B models.\n        *   Two data regimes for GSM8K: with and without SFT data.\n        *   Comparison of EI, PPO (sparse, dense, ORM-guided), and RCRL.\n        *   Analysis of sample complexity for EI and PPO.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**:\n        *   `maj@1`: Greedy sampling accuracy.\n        *   `maj@96`: Majority vote accuracy from 96 samples.\n        *   `rerank@96`: Accuracy after reranking 96 samples using an ORM.\n        *   `pass@96`: Best of 96 samples accuracy (using ground truth).\n    *   **Comparison Results**:\n        *   **EI Outperformance**: EI consistently achieved the best performance, e.g., improving `maj@1` by ~7% over the SFT baseline for both 7B and 13B models.\n        *   **Competitive Sample Complexity**: EI was found to be nearly as sample-efficient as PPO, requiring only a few thousand samples to converge even from a pretrained checkpoint (on the order of 10^6 total samples).\n        *   **PPO Underperformance**: PPO models generally underperformed EI, with ORM-guided PPO showing the largest improvement among PPO variants (~5% over SFT baseline).\n        *   **RCRL Underperformance**: RCRL models underperformed EI despite training on EI-generated data.\n        *   **SFT vs. RL Trade-off Resolution**: RL fine-tuning was shown to improve both `maj@1` and `pass@96` simultaneously, addressing a trade-off observed during SFT training.\n        *   **Impact of Initialization**: The gap between pretrained and SFT model performance significantly shrinks after RL fine-tuning, with larger models showing a smaller gap. Resetting training to the pretrained base model for EI and RCRL (after data generation with SFT) was found to be crucial.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**:\n        *   The reasoning tasks considered (math word problems) have entirely deterministic dynamics, which might favor direct behavior cloning methods like EI and RCRL over PPO, which often excels in stochastic environments.\n        *   A significant limitation identified is the lack of sophisticated exploration by models during RL fine-tuning, which restricts the potential gains from RL, particularly for PPO.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The findings are primarily demonstrated on math word problem benchmarks (GSM8K, SVAMP) using Llama-2 models. While the insights about exploration and algorithm comparison are general, their direct applicability to highly stochastic or open-ended reasoning tasks might require further investigation.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: This paper provides crucial empirical evidence and analysis for the effective application of RL to LLM reasoning. It challenges the common assumption that complex online RL algorithms like PPO are always superior, demonstrating that simpler methods like Expert Iteration can achieve better performance with comparable sample efficiency in deterministic reasoning contexts.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n        *   **RLHF Implications**: The findings suggest that the choice of RL algorithm in RLHF might be less critical than previously thought, especially if the underlying task dynamics are deterministic or if exploration is limited.\n        *   **Focus on Exploration**: The identification of limited exploration as a major bottleneck highlights a critical area for future research in LLM fine-tuning via RL. Developing more sophisticated exploration strategies for LLMs in reasoning tasks could unlock significant performance gains.\n        *   **Rethinking RL for LLMs**: The work encourages a re-evaluation of the role and choice of RL algorithms for LLM fine-tuning, suggesting that simpler, more off-policy methods might be highly effective, particularly when combined with strategies that enhance data diversity.",

Prior work largely evaluated models on in-distribution data, leaving generalisation properties underexplored.\n        *   **Output Diversity**: Essential for creative, open-ended tasks (e.g., story generation, scientific research, red teaming) where varied, high-quality outputs are desired. Previous work on diversity was limited to simple token-level metrics and less common use cases, lacking rigorous, multi-task analysis across the full RLHF pipeline.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: \\cite{kirk20230it} builds upon the standard RLHF pipeline (SFT, RM, PPO-based RL) used in prominent models like ChatGPT and Claude. It also considers Best-of-N (BoN) sampling as an alternative use of reward models.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   Most prior RLHF evaluations focused on in-distribution performance, neglecting OOD generalisation. While some OOD experiments existed (e.g., Stiennon et al., 2022), they did not rigorously investigate the impact of *different pipeline stages* on generalisation.\n        *   Previous work on diversity (e.g., Khalifa et al., 2021; Perez et al., 2022) showed a decrease in diversity from RLHF but was limited to simple token-level metrics (like self-BLEU) and specific use cases. \\cite{kirk20230it} extends this by employing a wider range of externally validated diversity metrics and applying them across different tasks.\n        *   Frameworks like AlpacaFarm (Dubois et al., 2023) demonstrated RLHF's superiority over SFT on specific evaluation sets but did not address OOD generalisation or output diversity.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper conducts an extensive, systematic analysis of the standard RLHF pipeline by evaluating models at each stage (SFT, RM, RLHF) and also Best-of-N (BoN) sampling. This analysis is performed across two base LLMs (LLaMa 7B, and OPT for scale trends) on two distinct tasks: text summarisation and instruction following.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   **Comprehensive Pipeline Analysis**: Rigorously disentangles the effects of each RLHF stage on generalisation and diversity, which was previously underexplored.\n        *   **Multi-faceted OOD Generalisation Evaluation**: Utilises carefully constructed in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets that induce realistic distribution shifts (e.g., TL;DR vs. CNN/DailyMail for summarisation, AlpacaEval vs. novel Sequential Instructions for instruction following).\n        *   **Advanced Diversity Metrics**: Employs a range of externally validated diversity metrics (Distinct N-grams (EAD), Sentence-BERT embedding cosine similarity, NLI diversity) that capture syntactic, semantic, and logical variations, moving beyond simple token-level measures.\n        *   **Simulated Human Evaluation**: Leverages GPT-4 as a simulated human annotator for performance evaluation (preference vs. reference, head-to-head comparisons), validated against human preferences, to enable scalable and consistent assessment.\n        *   **BoN for Attribution**: Includes Best-of-N sampling to discern whether observed differences between RLHF and SFT are due to the reward model's influence or the specific type of optimisation applied in RL.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Analysis Framework**: A systematic methodology for evaluating the impact of individual RLHF pipeline stages on OOD generalisation and output diversity, using a combination of simulated human evaluation and advanced diversity metrics.\n    *   **Empirical Insights into RLHF Tradeoffs**: Provides concrete evidence of an inherent tension: RLHF significantly improves OOD generalisation compared to SFT, but simultaneously substantially reduces output diversity.\n    *   **Specific OOD Datasets**: Introduction and use of novel OOD test sets, particularly the \"Sequential Instructions\" dataset for instruction following, designed to probe specific aspects of generalisation.\n    *   **Comprehensive Diversity Measurement**: Application and validation of a suite of diversity metrics that offer a more nuanced understanding of output variation than previously used methods.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**:\n        *   Models: LLaMa 7B (main analysis), OPT (for scale trends).\n        *   Tasks: Text summarisation (TL;DR dataset, CNN/DailyMail for OOD) and instruction following (AlpacaFarm datasets, AlpacaEval, and novel Sequential Instructions for OOD).\n        *   Fine-tuning Methods: SFT, Reward Modelling (RM), RLHF (PPO-based), and Best-of-N (BoN) sampling.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**:\n        *   **Generalisation**: GPT-4 preference win rate (Preference vs. Reference - PvR), head-to-head win rates between policies, and generalisation gap (ID vs. OOD performance difference).\n        *   **Diversity**: Expectation-Adjusted Distinct N-grams (EAD), Sentence-BERT embedding cosine similarity, and NLI diversity.\n    *   **Comparison Results**:\n        *   **Generalisation**: RLHF consistently improves in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance compared to SFT. This improvement is particularly pronounced as the distribution shift between training and test data increases. Lower generalisation gaps were observed for RLHF.\n        *   **Diversity**: RLHF substantially decreases output diversity compared to SFT. This reduction was observed for outputs sampled for a single input and, on some metrics, even for outputs generated across different inputs, suggesting a tendency for RLHF models to produce more similar text regardless of the prompt.\n        *   **BoN Insights**: Evaluating BoN helped attribute some of the observed differences to the reward model's influence rather than solely the RL optimisation process.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**: The analysis primarily focuses on the LLaMa 7B model and a specific PPO-based RLHF pipeline with a fixed KL penalty (`beta_KL=0.05`). While OPT models were used for scale trends, the main findings are derived from the 7B scale. The use of GPT-4 as a simulated human, while validated, is still a proxy for true human preferences.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The findings are specific to the summarisation and instruction-following tasks and the particular datasets used. While these are highly relevant for current LLM use cases, the generalisability to other NLP tasks or different RLHF variants (e.g., offline RL methods, different reward model architectures) is not directly explored. The observed tradeoff is a limitation of *current* fine-tuning techniques, not necessarily a fundamental limitation of LLMs.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: \\cite{kirk20230it} provides the first rigorous, multi-faceted empirical analysis of how each stage of the RLHF pipeline impacts OOD generalisation and output diversity. It moves beyond anecdotal observations and limited prior studies to offer concrete, data-driven insights.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n        *   **Highlights a Critical Tradeoff**: Clearly identifies an inherent tension between generalisation and diversity in current RLHF methods, posing a significant challenge for future LLM development.\n        *   **Guides Method Selection**: The findings offer practical guidance for practitioners on selecting fine-tuning methods based on application requirements (e.g., prioritising generalisation vs. diversity).\n        *   **Motivates Novel Research**: Underscores the urgent need for novel fine-tuning techniques that can improve both generalisation and diversity simultaneously, or better manage this tradeoff, rather than sacrificing one for the other. It also prompts fundamental research into whether this tension is an intrinsic property of fine-tuning or a solvable limitation of current approaches.\n        *   **Open-Sourced Code**: The release of the code promotes reproducible research and facilitates further investigation into these critical areas.",
    "intriguing_abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is pivotal for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), yet its precise influence on critical properties like out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation and output diversity remains largely underexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive, systematic analysis dissecting the effects of each RLHF pipeline stage—Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reward Modelling (RM), and RLHF itself—on these crucial attributes. Employing novel OOD test sets for text summarisation and instruction following, alongside advanced diversity metrics (e.g., Expectation-Adjusted Distinct N-grams, Sentence-BERT similarity, NLI diversity) and GPT-4 as a simulated human evaluator, we uncover a fundamental tension. Our findings reveal that while RLHF significantly enhances OOD generalisation compared to SFT, it simultaneously leads to a substantial reduction in output diversity. This empirical evidence highlights a critical tradeoff inherent in current RLHF approaches, challenging developers to devise novel fine-tuning strategies that can simultaneously improve both generalisation and diversity. This work provides essential insights for advancing robust and versatile LLM development, prompting a re-evaluation of current alignment paradigms.",

While there has been significant work developing these methods, our understanding of the benefits and downsides of each stage in RLHF is still limited. To fill this gap, we present an extensive analysis of how each stage of the process (i.e. supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modelling, and RLHF) affects two key properties: out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation and output diversity. OOD generalisation is crucial given the wide range of real-world scenarios in which these models are being used, while output diversity refers to the model's ability to generate varied outputs and is important for a variety of use cases. We perform our analysis across two base models on both summarisation and instruction following tasks, the latter being highly relevant for current LLM use cases. We find that RLHF generalises better than SFT to new inputs, particularly as the distribution shift between train and test becomes larger. However, RLHF significantly reduces output diversity compared to SFT across a variety of measures, implying a tradeoff in current LLM fine-tuning methods between generalisation and diversity. Our results provide guidance on which fine-tuning method should be used depending on the application, and show that more research is needed to improve the tradeoff between generalisation and diversity.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have formulated a blueprint for the advancement of artificial general intelligence. Its primary objective is to function as a human-centric (helpful, honest, and harmless) assistant. Alignment with humans assumes paramount significance, and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) emerges as the pivotal technological paradigm underpinning this pursuit. Current technical routes usually include \\textbf{reward models} to measure human preferences, \\textbf{Proximal Policy Optimization} (PPO) to optimize policy model outputs, and \\textbf{process supervision} to improve step-by-step reasoning capabilities. However, due to the challenges of reward design, environment interaction, and agent training, coupled with huge trial and error cost of large language models, there is a significant barrier for AI researchers to motivate the development of technical alignment and safe landing of LLMs. The stable training of RLHF has still been a puzzle. In the first report, we dissect the framework of RLHF, re-evaluate the inner workings of PPO, and explore how the parts comprising PPO algorithms impact policy agent training. We identify policy constraints being the key factor for the effective implementation of the PPO algorithm. Therefore, we explore the PPO-max, an advanced version of PPO algorithm, to efficiently improve the training stability of the policy model. Based on our main results, we perform a comprehensive analysis of RLHF abilities compared with SFT models and ChatGPT. The absence of open-source implementations has posed significant challenges to the investigation of LLMs alignment. Therefore, we are eager to release technical reports, reward models and PPO codes, aiming to make modest contributions to the advancement of LLMs.",

    "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **1. Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often leads large language models (LLMs) to produce longer outputs, and it is unclear to what extent these length increases genuinely reflect improved quality versus being a spurious correlation that the optimization process exploits \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** RLHF is crucial for aligning LLMs with desired properties like helpfulness. However, its success relies on correctly specified reward models and robust optimization. Over-optimization or \"reward hacking\" can cause models to optimize shallow correlations (like length) instead of meaningful quality, potentially misrepresenting actual progress \\cite{singhal2023egk}. Prior work noted length increases but largely dismissed them, necessitating a deeper investigation into their underlying causes and significance \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n\n*   **2. Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** This work builds upon the established RLHF pipeline, which involves training a reward model from human preferences and then using PPO to maximize that reward \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:** Previous studies observed increased output length after RLHF but largely dismissed it as a PPO artifact \\cite{singhal2023egk}. There has been limited examination of which features truly improve in policy models and whether these correspond to meaningful quality gains or merely shallow reward correlations \\cite{singhal2023egk}. The paper highlights that reward models can be misaligned or over-optimized, leading to pathological behaviors \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n\n*   **3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper systematically investigates the role of output length in RLHF by:\n        *   Analyzing the correlation between output length and reward model scores across three diverse settings (WebGPT, Stack, RLCD) \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n        *   Performing a length-stratified analysis to disentangle reward improvements due to length increases from those due to other features \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n        *   Conducting a controlled experiment where the learned reward model is replaced with a purely length-based heuristic during PPO training (Length-Only PPO, LPPO) \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n        *   Implementing and evaluating a comprehensive set of \"anti-length\" interventions across different stages of the RLHF pipeline (reward model training, PPO optimization, KL loss, reward scaling, output sampling) \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n        *   Studying reward model training dynamics to identify the dominant source of length biases \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:** This is the first in-depth study to demonstrate that optimizing for response length is a *surprisingly significant factor* behind RLHF improvements, much more than previously acknowledged \\cite{singhal2023egk}. The introduction of LPPO, which achieves comparable performance to standard RLHF, is a novel and striking finding \\cite{singhal2023egk}. The systematic exploration of interventions across the entire RLHF pipeline to mitigate length bias, and the identification of reward models as the primary source of this bias, are also key innovations \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n\n*   **4. Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms, Methods, or Techniques:**\n        *   **Length-stratified analysis:** A method to quantify the \"Non-Length Reward Gain\" (NRG), separating reward improvements attributable to within-bucket quality increases from those due to shifting to longer outputs \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n        *   **Length-Only PPO (LPPO):** A novel experimental setup demonstrating that PPO trained with a simple length-based reward can reproduce most downstream RLHF improvements, challenging the perceived sophistication of learned reward models \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n        *   **Comprehensive Anti-Length Interventions:** A systematic framework for testing various strategies to control output length during RLHF, including modifications to KL loss, output sampling, reward penalization, and reward scaling \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights or Analysis:**\n        *   Demonstration that current reward models often model only shallow aspects of human preferences, exhibiting strong correlations with length at the expense of other features \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n        *   Insight that the KL regularization term in PPO, even with a length-only reward, can implicitly encourage the model to generate more descriptive (non-pathological) outputs while maximizing length \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n        *   Identification of reward models as the dominant source of length biases, which are non-robust and easily influenced by length biases present in preference data during training \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n\n*   **5. Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:**\n        *   Comparison of output lengths and reward scores between SFT and PPO models.\n        *   Length-stratified analysis of reward gains for standard and high-KL PPO.\n        *   Evaluation of LPPO against standard PPO and a \"longest-of-8 SFT samples\" baseline (SFT-LONG).\n        *   Testing of various interventions on PPO optimization (e.g., high KL coefficient, omitting long outputs, penalizing length, reward scaling) and reward modeling (e.g., length-balancing preference data) \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n    *   **Datasets:** Experiments were conducted on three diverse \"helpfulness\" preference datasets: WebGPT (human labels for QA), Stack (upvote-derived labels for technical QA), and RLCD (synthetic preferences for multi-turn dialogue) \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results:**\n        *   PPO consistently led to significant increases in output length across all settings \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n        *   Reward model scores were strongly correlated with output length (e.g., Figure 1) \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n        *   For WebGPT and RLCD, 70-90% of the PPO's reward improvement was explained by length shifts, with Non-Length Reward Gain (NRG) being negligible for WebGPT (2% of total gain) \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n        *   LPPO achieved simulated preference win rates comparable to standard PPO (e.g., 56% vs 58% on WebGPT, 64% vs 63% on RLCD), demonstrating that length optimization alone can reproduce most RLHF \"improvements\" \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n        *   LPPO even outperformed SFT-LONG, suggesting that the KL term enables qualitative improvements beyond mere length extension \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n        *   Anti-length interventions successfully mitigated length increases, sometimes without degrading downstream performance, but no single intervention worked universally across all settings \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n\n*   **6. Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The study acknowledges that the AlpacaFarm simulated preference metric used for downstream evaluation might itself have length biases, which could confound results, although this is partially examined \\cite{singhal2023egk}. Some stricter anti-length interventions were found to impede model convergence \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The findings are primarily focused on RLHF for \"helpfulness\" tasks in LLMs. While the underlying mechanisms might generalize, the specific impact of length correlation could vary for other alignment objectives (e.g., harmlessness) or different model architectures \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n\n*   **7. Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of Technical State-of-the-Art:** This paper significantly advances the understanding of RLHF by demonstrating that output length is a much more dominant factor in reward optimization than previously recognized \\cite{singhal2023egk}. It challenges the assumption that reported RLHF improvements are solely due to genuine quality enhancements, highlighting the critical role of spurious correlations \\cite{singhal2023egk}. It also exposes the non-robustness of current reward models and their susceptibility to length biases \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:** The work calls for a re-evaluation of current RLHF practices, emphasizing the need for: (1) better preference data collection that is less biased towards length, (2) more robust reward model training techniques that can disentangle length from other quality features, and (3) improved downstream evaluation metrics that are not susceptible to length biases \\cite{singhal2023egk}. It encourages future research to explicitly account for and control output length to ensure that reported advancements in RLHF truly reflect meaningful quality improvements \\cite{singhal2023egk}.",
    "intriguing_abstract": "The remarkable success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) often comes with a curious side effect: significantly longer outputs.

Strikingly, our novel **Length-Only PPO (LPPO)**, trained with a simple length-based reward, achieves comparable performance to standard RLHF, challenging the sophistication of learned reward models. We identify **reward models** as the primary source of this length bias, which are non-robust and easily influenced by preference data. Our comprehensive suite of **anti-length interventions** further explores mitigation strategies.

Alongside these improvements, however, RLHF also often drives models to produce longer outputs. This paper demonstrates, on three diverse settings, that optimizing for response length is, much more than previously thought, a significant factor behind RLHF. Studying the strategies RL optimization uses to maximize reward, we find improvements in reward to largely be driven by increasing response length, instead of other features. Indeed, we find that even a purely length-based reward reproduces most downstream RLHF improvements over supervised fine-tuned models. Testing a comprehensive set of length-countering interventions, we identify the dominant source of these biases to be reward models, which, by studying training dynamics, we find are non-robust and easily influenced by length biases in preference data.",

Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often leads large language models (LLMs) to produce longer outputs, and it is unclear to what extent these length increases genuinely reflect improved quality versus being a spurious correlation that the optimization process exploits \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** RLHF is crucial for aligning LLMs with desired properties like helpfulness. However, its success relies on correctly specified reward models and robust optimization. Over-optimization or \"reward hacking\" can cause models to optimize shallow correlations (like length) instead of meaningful quality, potentially misrepresenting actual progress \\cite{singhal2023egk}. Prior work noted length increases but largely dismissed them, necessitating a deeper investigation into their underlying causes and significance \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n\n*   **2. Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** This work builds upon the established RLHF pipeline, which involves training a reward model from human preferences and then using PPO to maximize that reward \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:** Previous studies observed increased output length after RLHF but largely dismissed it as a PPO artifact \\cite{singhal2023egk}. There has been limited examination of which features truly improve in policy models and whether these correspond to meaningful quality gains or merely shallow reward correlations \\cite{singhal2023egk}. The paper highlights that reward models can be misaligned or over-optimized, leading to pathological behaviors \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n\n*   **3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper systematically investigates the role of output length in RLHF by:\n        *   Analyzing the correlation between output length and reward model scores across three diverse settings (WebGPT, Stack, RLCD) \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n        *   Performing a length-stratified analysis to disentangle reward improvements due to length increases from those due to other features \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n        *   Conducting a controlled experiment where the learned reward model is replaced with a purely length-based heuristic during PPO training (Length-Only PPO, LPPO) \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n        *   Implementing and evaluating a comprehensive set of \"anti-length\" interventions across different stages of the RLHF pipeline (reward model training, PPO optimization, KL loss, reward scaling, output sampling) \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n        *   Studying reward model training dynamics to identify the dominant source of length biases \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:** This is the first in-depth study to demonstrate that optimizing for response length is a *surprisingly significant factor* behind RLHF improvements, much more than previously acknowledged \\cite{singhal2023egk}. The introduction of LPPO, which achieves comparable performance to standard RLHF, is a novel and striking finding \\cite{singhal2023egk}. The systematic exploration of interventions across the entire RLHF pipeline to mitigate length bias, and the identification of reward models as the primary source of this bias, are also key innovations \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n\n*   **4. Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms, Methods, or Techniques:**\n        *   **Length-stratified analysis:** A method to quantify the \"Non-Length Reward Gain\" (NRG), separating reward improvements attributable to within-bucket quality increases from those due to shifting to longer outputs \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n        *   **Length-Only PPO (LPPO):** A novel experimental setup demonstrating that PPO trained with a simple length-based reward can reproduce most downstream RLHF improvements, challenging the perceived sophistication of learned reward models \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n        *   **Comprehensive Anti-Length Interventions:** A systematic framework for testing various strategies to control output length during RLHF, including modifications to KL loss, output sampling, reward penalization, and reward scaling \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights or Analysis:**\n        *   Demonstration that current reward models often model only shallow aspects of human preferences, exhibiting strong correlations with length at the expense of other features \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n        *   Insight that the KL regularization term in PPO, even with a length-only reward, can implicitly encourage the model to generate more descriptive (non-pathological) outputs while maximizing length \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n        *   Identification of reward models as the dominant source of length biases, which are non-robust and easily influenced by length biases present in preference data during training \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n\n*   **5. Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:**\n        *   Comparison of output lengths and reward scores between SFT and PPO models.\n        *   Length-stratified analysis of reward gains for standard and high-KL PPO.\n        *   Evaluation of LPPO against standard PPO and a \"longest-of-8 SFT samples\" baseline (SFT-LONG).\n        *   Testing of various interventions on PPO optimization (e.g., high KL coefficient, omitting long outputs, penalizing length, reward scaling) and reward modeling (e.g., length-balancing preference data) \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n    *   **Datasets:** Experiments were conducted on three diverse \"helpfulness\" preference datasets: WebGPT (human labels for QA), Stack (upvote-derived labels for technical QA), and RLCD (synthetic preferences for multi-turn dialogue) \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results:**\n        *   PPO consistently led to significant increases in output length across all settings \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n        *   Reward model scores were strongly correlated with output length (e.g., Figure 1) \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n        *   For WebGPT and RLCD, 70-90% of the PPO's reward improvement was explained by length shifts, with Non-Length Reward Gain (NRG) being negligible for WebGPT (2% of total gain) \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n        *   LPPO achieved simulated preference win rates comparable to standard PPO (e.g., 56% vs 58% on WebGPT, 64% vs 63% on RLCD), demonstrating that length optimization alone can reproduce most RLHF \"improvements\" \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n        *   LPPO even outperformed SFT-LONG, suggesting that the KL term enables qualitative improvements beyond mere length extension \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n        *   Anti-length interventions successfully mitigated length increases, sometimes without degrading downstream performance, but no single intervention worked universally across all settings \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n\n*   **6. Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The study acknowledges that the AlpacaFarm simulated preference metric used for downstream evaluation might itself have length biases, which could confound results, although this is partially examined \\cite{singhal2023egk}. Some stricter anti-length interventions were found to impede model convergence \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The findings are primarily focused on RLHF for \"helpfulness\" tasks in LLMs. While the underlying mechanisms might generalize, the specific impact of length correlation could vary for other alignment objectives (e.g., harmlessness) or different model architectures \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n\n*   **7. Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of Technical State-of-the-Art:** This paper significantly advances the understanding of RLHF by demonstrating that output length is a much more dominant factor in reward optimization than previously recognized \\cite{singhal2023egk}. It challenges the assumption that reported RLHF improvements are solely due to genuine quality enhancements, highlighting the critical role of spurious correlations \\cite{singhal2023egk}. It also exposes the non-robustness of current reward models and their susceptibility to length biases \\cite{singhal2023egk}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:** The work calls for a re-evaluation of current RLHF practices, emphasizing the need for: (1) better preference data collection that is less biased towards length, (2) more robust reward model training techniques that can disentangle length from other quality features, and (3) improved downstream evaluation metrics that are not susceptible to length biases \\cite{singhal2023egk}. It encourages future research to explicitly account for and control output length to ensure that reported advancements in RLHF truly reflect meaningful quality improvements \\cite{singhal2023egk}.",

      "abstract": "The recent DeepSeek-R1 release has demonstrated the immense potential of reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing the general reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While DeepSeek-R1 and other follow-up work primarily focus on applying RL to competitive coding and math problems, this paper introduces SWE-RL, the first approach to scale RL-based LLM reasoning for real-world software engineering. Leveraging a lightweight rule-based reward (e.g., the similarity score between ground-truth and LLM-generated solutions), SWE-RL enables LLMs to autonomously recover a developer's reasoning processes and solutions by learning from extensive open-source software evolution data -- the record of a software's entire lifecycle, including its code snapshots, code changes, and events such as issues and pull requests. Trained on top of Llama 3, our resulting reasoning model, Llama3-SWE-RL-70B, achieves a 41.0% solve rate on SWE-bench Verified -- a human-verified collection of real-world GitHub issues. To our knowledge, this is the best performance reported for medium-sized (<100B) LLMs to date, even comparable to leading proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o. Surprisingly, despite performing RL solely on software evolution data, Llama3-SWE-RL has even emerged with generalized reasoning skills. For example, it shows improved results on five out-of-domain tasks, namely, function coding, library use, code reasoning, mathematics, and general language understanding, whereas a supervised-finetuning baseline even leads to performance degradation on average. Overall, SWE-RL opens up a new direction to improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through reinforcement learning on massive software engineering data.",

Research Problem & Motivation**\n*   The classical Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) framework, particularly its reliance on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), faces significant challenges in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) \\cite{zhong2024wch}.\n*   **Problem 1: Mismatch in Formulation:** PPO is designed for multi-step Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) requiring token-wise rewards, but RLHF is often formulated as a bandit problem with sparse, sentence-level rewards \\cite{zhong2024wch}.\n*   **Problem 2: Sub-optimal PPO Implementation:** Existing open-source PPO implementations for RLHF typically assign the learned sentence-level reward only to the last token, with other tokens receiving zero learned reward, leading to reward sparsity and making learning difficult \\cite{zhong2024wch}.\n*   **Problem 3: Instability and Sample Inefficiency:** PPO training in RLHF is known to be unstable and sample-inefficient, requiring extensive resources and effort to tune effectively \\cite{zhong2024wch}.\n*   **Motivation:** Improving PPO's performance in RLHF is crucial, as alternative direct preference learning methods, while promising, have not yet consistently achieved state-of-the-art LLM alignment without PPO \\cite{zhong2024wch}. There is a need for a more fine-grained, token-wise reward characterization within a robust RLHF framework.\n\n**2. Related Work & Positioning**\n*   **Classical RLHF & PPO:** The foundational RLHF pipeline (Christiano et al., 2017; Ziegler et al., 2019; Ouyang et al., 2022) uses PPO, but its tuning complexity and instability are major drawbacks \\cite{zhong2024wch}.\n*   **Alternative RLHF Algorithms:** Approaches like rejection sampling fine-tuning (Dong et al., 2023) and direct preference learning (e.g., DPO by Rafailov et al., 2023) aim to bypass PPO. However, \\cite{zhong2024wch} notes that these alternatives have limited evidence of achieving state-of-the-art LLM performance *alone* without PPO.\n*   **Theoretical RLHF Studies:** Prior theoretical work often formulates RLHF as a dueling bandit (Yue et al., 2012) or KL-regularized contextual bandit (Xiong et al., 2023), which are confined to a sentence-level bandit setting and do not capture the autoregressive nature of LLMs or provide token-wise feedback \\cite{zhong2024wch}.\n*   **Improving PPO with Dense Rewards:** Some concurrent works (Chan et al., 2024) also explore dense rewards for PPO by redistributing scalar rewards using attention. However, \\cite{zhong2024wch} distinguishes its approach by fundamentally different techniques for obtaining dense signals and its mathematical motivation.\n*   **Positioning of RTO:** \\cite{zhong2024wch} positions RTO as an enhancement to the PPO algorithm within RLHF, addressing the core mismatch between PPO's MDP design and the sparse, bandit-like formulation of RLHF. It introduces a principled MDP framework with token-wise rewards and innovatively integrates DPO to extract these fine-grained signals for PPO training \\cite{zhong2024wch}.\n\n**3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n*   **Core Technical Method: Reinforced Token Optimization (RTO)** \\cite{zhong2024wch}.\n*   **MDP Formulation for RLHF:** The paper re-frames RLHF as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where each state `sh` includes the prompt and previously generated tokens, and each action `ah` is a single token. This explicitly models the autoregressive nature of LLM generation and allows for token-wise reward assignment \\cite{zhong2024wch}.\n*   **Token-wise Reward Learning:** The preference signal is modeled using a Bradley-Terry (BT) model based on the *sum of token-wise rewards* across a trajectory, enabling RTO to learn a token-wise reward function from offline preference data \\cite{zhong2024wch}.\n*   **Novel Token-wise Reward Extraction via DPO:** The key innovation is using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to derive a token-wise characterization of response quality. DPO, originally for sparse sentence rewards, is surprisingly shown to provide a fine-grained, token-level reward signal. This DPO-based token-wise reward function is then assigned to each token in the sequence \\cite{zhong2024wch}.\n*   **PPO Optimization with Dense Rewards:** After extracting the token-wise rewards, RTO seamlessly incorporates them into a subsequent PPO training stage. This provides PPO with dense, fine-grained reward signals at each step, addressing the sparsity issue of traditional PPO implementations in RLHF \\cite{zhong2024wch}.\n*   **Integration of DPO and PPO:** RTO innovatively combines the strengths of DPO (for token-wise reward extraction) and PPO (for policy optimization), creating a more robust and effective RLHF pipeline \\cite{zhong2024wch}.\n\n**4. Key Technical Contributions**\n*   **Novel Framework:** Proposing a principled MDP formulation for RLHF that precisely captures the token-wise generation process of LLMs, moving beyond the traditional sentence-level bandit formulation \\cite{zhong2024wch}.\n*   **Algorithm (RTO):** Introducing Reinforced Token Optimization (RTO), an algorithm designed to learn token-wise reward functions from preference data and perform policy optimization based on these fine-grained signals \\cite{zhong2024wch}.\n*   **Theoretical Insight:** Providing theoretical proof that RTO, under the MDP formulation and using MLE as a token-wise reward learning oracle, can find a near-optimal policy in a sample-efficient manner \\cite{zhong2024wch}.\n*   **Innovative Reward Extraction:** A novel method for extracting dense, token-wise reward signals from existing direct preference optimization (DPO) principles, which were originally conceived for sparse, sentence-level rewards \\cite{zhong2024wch}. This bridges the gap between preference learning and step-wise RL.\n*   **System Design:** A new RLHF pipeline that seamlessly integrates DPO for token-wise reward modeling and PPO for policy optimization, addressing the limitations of sparse rewards in PPO-based RLHF \\cite{zhong2024wch}.\n\n**5. Experimental Validation**\n*   **Benchmarks:** Extensive experiments were conducted on prominent LLM alignment benchmarks: AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard \\cite{zhong2024wch}.\n*   **Key Performance Metrics:** Performance improvement over baselines, likely measured by win rates or preference scores.\n*   **Comparison Results:**\n    *   RTO significantly outperforms traditional PPO, achieving a **7.5-point improvement on the AlpacaEval 2 benchmark** \\cite{zhong2024wch}.\n    *   RTO also outperforms PPO by **4.1 points on Arena-Hard** \\cite{zhong2024wch}.\n    *   RTO demonstrates superior performance compared to other direct preference learning algorithms, including DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023), R-DPO (Park et al., 2024), and SimPO (Meng et al., 2024) \\cite{zhong2024wch}.\n*   **Data Scaling Properties:** RTO exhibits strong data efficiency:\n    *   It achieves performance comparable to PPO using only **1/8 of the training data** \\cite{zhong2024wch}.\n    *   Unlike PPO, which saturates early, RTO continues to show **performance improvements as more data is added**, indicating better scalability and learning capacity \\cite{zhong2024wch}.\n*   **Availability:** Code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/zkshan2002/RTO, enabling reproducibility and further research \\cite{zhong2024wch}.\n\n**6. Limitations & Scope**\n*   **Assumptions:** The theoretical analysis assumes MLE as a token-wise reward learning oracle, which might be an idealization in practical scenarios \\cite{zhong2024wch}.\n*   **Scope of Applicability:** The method is primarily focused on improving PPO-based RL training for LLM alignment by leveraging token-wise rewards. While it shows broad applicability (e.g., in subsequent works for chat and reasoning), its direct validation is within the context of general LLM alignment benchmarks \\cite{zhong2024wch}.\n*   **Reward Model Imperfection:** While RTO aims to provide a more robust reward signal, it still relies on the quality of the DPO-derived token-wise reward, which could inherit limitations from the DPO process itself or the underlying preference data \\cite{zhong2024wch}.\n\n**7. Technical Significance**\n*   **Advancing State-of-the-Art RLHF:** RTO significantly improves the performance and data efficiency of PPO in RLHF, addressing long-standing issues of instability and sparse rewards, thereby advancing the technical state-of-the-art in LLM alignment \\cite{zhong2024wch}.\n*   **Bridging Theoretical and Practical Gaps:** By formally modeling RLHF as an MDP and providing theoretical guarantees for sample-efficient learning, the paper bridges a gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementation in LLM alignment \\cite{zhong2024wch}.\n*   **Innovative Integration:** The novel integration of DPO for token-wise reward extraction with PPO for policy optimization offers a new paradigm for designing more effective RLHF algorithms \\cite{zhong2024wch}.\n*   **Enabling Fine-Grained Control:** The shift to a token-wise MDP formulation and the ability to derive dense token-level rewards open avenues for more fine-grained control and understanding of LLM generation during alignment \\cite{zhong2024wch}.\n*   **Impact on Future Research:** This work provides a strong foundation for future research into token-wise reward modeling, more stable and efficient RL algorithms for LLMs, and potentially for developing more interpretable and controllable generative models \\cite{zhong2024wch}. The demonstrated data scaling properties suggest a path towards more efficient training of large models.",

      "abstract": "In the classical Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) framework, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is employed to learn from sparse, sentence-level rewards -- a challenging scenario in traditional deep reinforcement learning. Despite the great successes of PPO in the alignment of large language models, its open-source implementation is still largely sub-optimal. To address these issues, we introduce a framework that models RLHF problems as a Markov decision process (MDP), enabling the capture of fine-grained token-wise information. Under this framework, we introduce an algorithm Reinforced Token Optimization (\\texttt{RTO}), which learns the token-wise reward function from preference data and performs policy optimization based on this learned token-wise reward signal. Theoretically, \\texttt{RTO} is proven to have the capability of finding the near-optimal policy sample-efficiently. For its practical implementation, \\texttt{RTO} innovatively integrates Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and PPO. DPO, originally derived from sparse sentence rewards, surprisingly provides us with a token-wise characterization of response quality, which is seamlessly incorporated into our subsequent PPO training stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \\texttt{RTO} performs better than PPO and other direct preference learning algorithms. In particular, RTO outperforms PPO by 7.5 points on the AlpacaEval 2 benchmark and by 4.1 points on Arena-Hard.

      "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been crucial to the recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs), however, it is often a complex and brittle process. In the classical RLHF framework, a reward model is first trained to represent human preferences, which is in turn used by an online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to optimize the LLM. A prominent issue with such methods is reward over-optimization or reward hacking, where performance as measured by the learned proxy reward model increases, but true quality plateaus or even deteriorates. Direct Alignment Algorithms (DDAs) like Direct Preference Optimization have emerged as alternatives to the classical RLHF pipeline by circumventing the reward modeling phase. However, although DAAs do not use a separate proxy reward model, they still commonly deteriorate from over-optimization. While the so-called reward hacking phenomenon is not well-defined for DAAs, we still uncover similar trends: at higher KL budgets, DAA algorithms exhibit similar degradation patterns to their classic RLHF counterparts. In particular, we find that DAA methods deteriorate not only across a wide range of KL budgets but also often before even a single epoch of the dataset is completed. Through extensive empirical experimentation, this work formulates and formalizes the reward over-optimization or hacking problem for DAAs and explores its consequences across objectives, training regimes, and model scales.",

In this paper, we propose RL-VLM-F, a method that automatically generates reward functions for agents to learn new tasks, using only a text description of the task goal and the agent's visual observations, by leveraging feedbacks from vision language foundation models (VLMs). The key to our approach is to query these models to give preferences over pairs of the agent's image observations based on the text description of the task goal, and then learn a reward function from the preference labels, rather than directly prompting these models to output a raw reward score, which can be noisy and inconsistent. We demonstrate that RL-VLM-F successfully produces effective rewards and policies across various domains - including classic control, as well as manipulation of rigid, articulated, and deformable objects - without the need for human supervision, outperforming prior methods that use large pretrained models for reward generation under the same assumptions.

Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Fine-tuning diffusion models using Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) traditionally requires training a separate reward model to align with human preferences.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge**: Training a robust reward model is resource-intensive, demanding extensive datasets, optimal architecture design, and manual hyperparameter tuning, leading to high time and cost overheads. While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) eliminates reward models for Large Language Models (LLMs), its direct application to diffusion models is hindered by the massive GPU memory requirements needed to store gradients across numerous latent image representations during the multi-step denoising process.\n\n*   **2. Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Previous RLHF methods for diffusion models, such as DDPO `[5]` and ReLF `[60]`, rely on training a reward model (e.g., ImageReward). DPO `[43]` for LLMs offers a reward-model-free approach but is not directly applicable to diffusion models due to memory constraints.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: All existing RLHF-based diffusion model fine-tuning methods necessitate a robust reward model, which requires substantial datasets and extensive human evaluations. The direct application of DPO to diffusion models is computationally prohibitive due to the large memory footprint of latent image gradients.\n    *   **Positioning**: `\\cite{yang2023hyy}` introduces D3PO as the first method to directly fine-tune diffusion models with human feedback *without* training any reward model, thereby addressing the computational and data overheads of prior RLHF approaches and the memory limitations of direct DPO application.\n\n*   **3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The Direct Preference for Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (D3PO) method. It reinterprets the diffusion model's denoising process as a multi-step Markov Decision Process (MDP).\n    *   **Novelty**: `\\cite{yang2023hyy}` extends the theoretical framework of DPO to this multi-step MDP, allowing for direct parameter updates at each step of the denoising process based on human feedback. This circumvents the need for a reward model and significantly reduces computational costs by avoiding the storage of gradients for entire image sequences, which was the bottleneck for direct DPO application.\n\n*   **4. Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithm**: Introduction of D3PO, a novel algorithm for fine-tuning diffusion models directly from human preferences without a reward model.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights**: `\\cite{yang2023hyy}` provides a theoretical analysis demonstrating that D3PO, despite omitting reward model training, effectively functions as if an optimal reward model (trained with human feedback) is guiding the learning process. This includes a proposition showing the optimal policy's expression in terms of the action-value function and a bound on the deviation between the preference distributions derived from cumulative rewards and Q-values.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: Conceptualization of the denoising process as a multi-step MDP with redefined states, transition probabilities, and policy functions, enabling the application of DPO principles to diffusion models.\n\n*   **5. Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: `\\cite{yang2023hyy}` evaluated D3PO's effectiveness in addressing specific challenges: reducing hand and full-body deformities in generated images, enhancing the safety of generated content, and improving prompt-image alignment.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results**:\n        *   D3PO uses the relative scale of objectives as a proxy for human preference.\n        *   It delivers comparable results to methods that rely on ground-truth rewards.\n        *   Experiments demonstrated D3PO's ability to reduce image distortion rates and generate safer images, particularly in scenarios where robust reward models are difficult to craft.\n        *   Figure 3 illustrates D3PO achieving comparable performance to reward-model-based methods across incompressibility, compressibility, and aesthetic objectives, often with fewer generated image sample pairs for parameter updates.\n\n*   **6. Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The theoretical analysis relies on assumptions such as the expected return satisfying a normal distribution and Q-values being bounded, which `\\cite{yang2023hyy}` argues are reasonable in practice with sufficient data and value clipping.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The method is primarily focused on fine-tuning diffusion models for specific tasks where human preferences are available, such as improving aesthetic quality, reducing deformities, or enhancing safety. It currently relies on human feedback, acknowledging the lack of reliable AI models for certain subjective judgments (e.g., hand generation normality, aesthetic appeal).\n\n*   **7. Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: `\\cite{yang2023hyy}` significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by introducing a reward-model-free RLHF framework for diffusion models. This makes the fine-tuning process more direct, cost-effective, and computationally efficient, bypassing a major bottleneck in previous approaches.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: This work opens new avenues for more accessible and scalable fine-tuning of generative models. It could enable broader application of human feedback in diffusion model development, especially for niche tasks where reward model creation is prohibitive, fostering research into more direct and efficient preference-based learning paradigms for complex generative systems.",

      "abstract": "Using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has shown significant promise in fine-tuning diffusion models. Previous methods start by training a reward model that aligns with human preferences, then leverage RL techniques to fine-tune the underlying models. However, crafting an efficient reward model demands extensive datasets, optimal architecture, and manual hyperparameter tuning, making the process both time and cost-intensive. The direct preference optimization (DPO) method, effective in fine-tuning large language models, eliminates the necessity for a reward model. However, the extensive GPU memory requirement of the diffusion model's denoising process hinders the direct application of the DPO method. To address this issue, we introduce the Direct Preference for De-noising Diffusion Policy Optimization (D3PO) method to directly fine-tune diffusion models. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that although D3PO omits training a reward model, it effectively functions as the optimal re-ward model trained using human feedback data to guide the learning process. This approach requires no training of a reward model, proving to be more direct, cost-effective, and minimizing computational overhead. In experiments, our method uses the relative scale of objectives as a proxy for human preference, delivering comparable results to methods using ground-truth rewards. Moreover, D3PO demonstrates the ability to reduce image distortion rates and generate safer images, overcoming challenges lacking robust reward models.

      "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper `\\cite{yang2023hyy}` for a literature review:\n\n*   **1. Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Fine-tuning diffusion models using Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) traditionally requires training a separate reward model to align with human preferences.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge**: Training a robust reward model is resource-intensive, demanding extensive datasets, optimal architecture design, and manual hyperparameter tuning, leading to high time and cost overheads. While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) eliminates reward models for Large Language Models (LLMs), its direct application to diffusion models is hindered by the massive GPU memory requirements needed to store gradients across numerous latent image representations during the multi-step denoising process.\n\n*   **2. Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Previous RLHF methods for diffusion models, such as DDPO `[5]` and ReLF `[60]`, rely on training a reward model (e.g., ImageReward). DPO `[43]` for LLMs offers a reward-model-free approach but is not directly applicable to diffusion models due to memory constraints.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: All existing RLHF-based diffusion model fine-tuning methods necessitate a robust reward model, which requires substantial datasets and extensive human evaluations. The direct application of DPO to diffusion models is computationally prohibitive due to the large memory footprint of latent image gradients.\n    *   **Positioning**: `\\cite{yang2023hyy}` introduces D3PO as the first method to directly fine-tune diffusion models with human feedback *without* training any reward model, thereby addressing the computational and data overheads of prior RLHF approaches and the memory limitations of direct DPO application.\n\n*   **3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The Direct Preference for Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (D3PO) method. It reinterprets the diffusion model's denoising process as a multi-step Markov Decision Process (MDP).\n    *   **Novelty**: `\\cite{yang2023hyy}` extends the theoretical framework of DPO to this multi-step MDP, allowing for direct parameter updates at each step of the denoising process based on human feedback. This circumvents the need for a reward model and significantly reduces computational costs by avoiding the storage of gradients for entire image sequences, which was the bottleneck for direct DPO application.\n\n*   **4. Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithm**: Introduction of D3PO, a novel algorithm for fine-tuning diffusion models directly from human preferences without a reward model.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights**: `\\cite{yang2023hyy}` provides a theoretical analysis demonstrating that D3PO, despite omitting reward model training, effectively functions as if an optimal reward model (trained with human feedback) is guiding the learning process. This includes a proposition showing the optimal policy's expression in terms of the action-value function and a bound on the deviation between the preference distributions derived from cumulative rewards and Q-values.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: Conceptualization of the denoising process as a multi-step MDP with redefined states, transition probabilities, and policy functions, enabling the application of DPO principles to diffusion models.\n\n*   **5. Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: `\\cite{yang2023hyy}` evaluated D3PO's effectiveness in addressing specific challenges: reducing hand and full-body deformities in generated images, enhancing the safety of generated content, and improving prompt-image alignment.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results**:\n        *   D3PO uses the relative scale of objectives as a proxy for human preference.\n        *   It delivers comparable results to methods that rely on ground-truth rewards.\n        *   Experiments demonstrated D3PO's ability to reduce image distortion rates and generate safer images, particularly in scenarios where robust reward models are difficult to craft.\n        *   Figure 3 illustrates D3PO achieving comparable performance to reward-model-based methods across incompressibility, compressibility, and aesthetic objectives, often with fewer generated image sample pairs for parameter updates.\n\n*   **6. Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The theoretical analysis relies on assumptions such as the expected return satisfying a normal distribution and Q-values being bounded, which `\\cite{yang2023hyy}` argues are reasonable in practice with sufficient data and value clipping.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The method is primarily focused on fine-tuning diffusion models for specific tasks where human preferences are available, such as improving aesthetic quality, reducing deformities, or enhancing safety. It currently relies on human feedback, acknowledging the lack of reliable AI models for certain subjective judgments (e.g., hand generation normality, aesthetic appeal).\n\n*   **7. Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: `\\cite{yang2023hyy}` significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by introducing a reward-model-free RLHF framework for diffusion models. This makes the fine-tuning process more direct, cost-effective, and computationally efficient, bypassing a major bottleneck in previous approaches.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: This work opens new avenues for more accessible and scalable fine-tuning of generative models. It could enable broader application of human feedback in diffusion model development, especially for niche tasks where reward model creation is prohibitive, fostering research into more direct and efficient preference-based learning paradigms for complex generative systems.",

However, such an approach overlooks the rich diversity of human preferences inherent in data collected from multiple users. In this work, we first derive an impossibility result of alignment with single reward RLHF, thereby highlighting its insufficiency in representing diverse human preferences. To provide an equitable solution to the problem, we learn a mixture of preference distributions via an expectation-maximization algorithm and propose a MaxMin alignment objective for policy learning inspired by the Egalitarian principle in social choice theory to better represent diverse human preferences. We elucidate the connection of our proposed approach to distributionally robust optimization and general utility RL, thereby highlighting the generality and robustness of our proposed solution. We present comprehensive experimental results on small-scale (GPT-2) and large-scale language models (with Tulu2-7B) and show the efficacy of the proposed approach in the presence of diversity among human preferences. Our algorithm achieves an average improvement of more than 16% in win-rates over conventional RLHF algorithms and improves the win-rate (accuracy) for minority groups by over 33% without compromising the performance of majority groups, showcasing the robustness and fairness of our approach.

This work proposes Chain-of-Thought Hub, an open-source evaluation suite on the multi-step reasoning capabilities of large language models. We are interested in this setting for two reasons: (1) from the behavior of GPT and PaLM model family, we observe that complex reasoning is likely to be a key differentiator between weaker and stronger LLMs; (2) we envisage large language models to become the next-generation computational platform and foster an ecosystem of LLM-based new applications, this naturally requires the foundation models to perform complex tasks that often involve the composition of linguistic and logical operations. Our approach is to compile a suite of challenging reasoning benchmarks to track the progress of LLMs. Our current results show that: (1) model scale clearly correlates with reasoning capabilities; (2) As of May 2023, Claude-v1.3 and PaLM-2 are the only two models that are comparable with GPT-4, while open-sourced models still lag behind; (3) LLaMA-65B performs closely to code-davinci-002, indicating that with successful further development such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), it has great potential to be close to GPT-3.5-Turbo. Our results also suggest that for the open-source efforts to catch up, the community may focus more on building better base models and exploring RLHF.",

We study a more sample-efficient alternative: using pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) as zero-shot reward models (RMs) to specify tasks via natural language. We propose a natural and general approach to using VLMs as reward models, which we call VLM-RMs. We use VLM-RMs based on CLIP to train a MuJoCo humanoid to learn complex tasks without a manually specified reward function, such as kneeling, doing the splits, and sitting in a lotus position. For each of these tasks, we only provide a single sentence text prompt describing the desired task with minimal prompt engineering. We provide videos of the trained agents at: https://sites.google.com/view/vlm-rm. We can improve performance by providing a second\"baseline\"prompt and projecting out parts of the CLIP embedding space irrelevant to distinguish between goal and baseline. Further, we find a strong scaling effect for VLM-RMs: larger VLMs trained with more compute and data are better reward models. The failure modes of VLM-RMs we encountered are all related to known capability limitations of current VLMs, such as limited spatial reasoning ability or visually unrealistic environments that are far off-distribution for the VLM. We find that VLM-RMs are remarkably robust as long as the VLM is large enough. This suggests that future VLMs will become more and more useful reward models for a wide range of RL applications.",

Existing approaches often require extensive fine-tuning of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or complex, ad-hoc procedures to extract rewards \\cite{rocamonde2023o9z}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to existing approaches**: This work proposes a simple, zero-shot approach to using pretrained VLMs as reward models, contrasting with prior attempts that required extensive fine-tuning of VLMs (e.g., Du et al., 2023) or complex ad-hoc procedures (e.g., Mahmoudieh et al., 2022) \\cite{rocamonde2023o9z}.\n    *   **Limitations of previous solutions**: Previous methods were either computationally expensive due to fine-tuning or procedurally complex, limiting their general applicability and sample efficiency \\cite{rocamonde2023o9z}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes VLM-RMs, a general method for using pretrained VLMs as zero-shot reward models for vision-based RL tasks \\cite{rocamonde2023o9z}.\n        *   Specifically, for CLIP-based VLM-RMs, the reward `RCLIP(s)` is computed as the cosine similarity between the CLIP language embedding of a natural language task description `l` and the CLIP image embedding of the current environment state's observation `ψ(s)` \\cite{rocamonde2023o9z}.\n        *   `RCLIP(s) = CLIP_L(l) · CLIP_I(ψ(s)) / (||CLIP_L(l)|| · ||CLIP_I(ψ(s))||)`\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   **Zero-shot and Language-Grounded**: The approach is zero-shot, meaning no fine-tuning of the VLM is required, and tasks are specified via simple natural language prompts (e.g., \"a humanoid robot kneeling\") \\cite{rocamonde2023o9z}.\n        *   **Goal-Baseline Regularization**: An innovative technique to improve reward quality by providing a second \"baseline\" prompt `b` (describing a neutral state). The state embedding is then projected onto the direction between the baseline and task embeddings, effectively removing irrelevant information and shaping the reward landscape \\cite{rocamonde2023o9z}. This is controlled by a regularization strength parameter `α`.\n        *   **Drop-in Replacement**: VLM-RMs can be used as a direct replacement for the reward signal in standard RL algorithms like DQN or SAC, with rewards computed in batches from a replay buffer \\cite{rocamonde2023o9z}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Method**: Introduction of VLM-RMs as a general, zero-shot framework for leveraging pretrained VLMs (specifically CLIP) as reward models for vision-based RL \\cite{rocamonde2023o9z}.\n    *   **Algorithmic Innovation**: Development of Goal-Baseline Regularization, a technique that uses a baseline language prompt to project out irrelevant information from the VLM's latent space, leading to better-shaped reward functions \\cite{rocamonde2023o9z}.\n    *   **Empirical Insight**: Demonstration of a strong scaling effect, where larger VLMs trained with more compute and data yield significantly better reward models, suggesting future VLMs will be even more effective \\cite{rocamonde2023o9z}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**:\n        *   Validation on classic control benchmarks: CartPole and MountainCar (including a custom textured version) \\cite{rocamonde2023o9z}.\n        *   Training a MuJoCo humanoid robot to perform complex, novel tasks (e.g., standing with raised arms, sitting in a lotus position, doing the splits, kneeling) using single-sentence text prompts \\cite{rocamonde2023o9z}.\n        *   Ablation studies on VLM size and the effect of Goal-Baseline Regularization \\cite{rocamonde2023o9z}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results**:\n        *   **Correlation with Ground Truth**: VLM-RMs showed high correlation with ground truth rewards in CartPole and textured MountainCar, especially with Goal-Baseline Regularization \\cite{rocamonde2023o9z}.\n        *   **Task Success Rate**: Achieved 100% task success in CartPole and textured MountainCar. Successfully trained the MuJoCo humanoid for complex tasks with minimal prompt engineering \\cite{rocamonde2023o9z}.\n        *   **Impact of Realism**: VLM-RMs performed significantly better in visually \"photorealistic\" environments (e.g., textured MountainCar) compared to abstract ones, indicating sensitivity to the VLM's training distribution \\cite{rocamonde2023o9z}.\n        *   **Scaling Effect**: Larger CLIP models were found to be significantly better reward models; the largest publicly available CLIP model was necessary to learn the complex humanoid tasks \\cite{rocamonde2023o9z}.\n        *   **Evaluation Methods**: Utilized ground truth rewards, EPIC distance (Equivalent Policy-Invariant Comparison) for reward function comparison, and human evaluation for tasks without ground truth \\cite{rocamonde2023o9z}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**: The failure modes encountered were primarily related to known limitations of current VLMs, such as limited spatial reasoning ability or environments that are visually unrealistic and far off-distribution for the VLM \\cite{rocamonde2023o9z}.\n    *   **Assumptions**: Assumes the VLM is \"large enough\" and the environment's visual observations are sufficiently realistic for the VLM to interpret correctly \\cite{rocamonde2023o9z}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: Primarily demonstrated in vision-based RL tasks within simulated environments (MuJoCo, OpenAI Gym) \\cite{rocamonde2023o9z}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: This work significantly advances the state-of-the-art by demonstrating that pretrained VLMs can serve as powerful, zero-shot reward models, drastically reducing the need for manual reward engineering or expensive human feedback in RL \\cite{rocamonde2023o9z}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n        *   Suggests that as VLMs continue to scale and improve, their utility as zero-shot reward models will increase, enabling RL agents to learn increasingly sophisticated tasks from natural language descriptions \\cite{rocamonde2023o9z}.\n        *   Opens avenues for research into improving VLM robustness to abstract visual environments and enhancing their spatial reasoning capabilities for RL applications \\cite{rocamonde2023o9z}.\n        *   Provides a foundation for more natural and accessible task specification in RL, potentially democratizing its application to a wider range of problems \\cite{rocamonde2023o9z}.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been credited as the key advance that has allowed Large Language Models (LLMs) to effectively follow instructions and produce useful assistance. Classically, this involves generating completions from the LLM in response to a query before using a separate reward model to assign a score to the full completion. As an auto-regressive process, the LLM has to take many\"actions\"(selecting individual tokens) and only receives a single, sparse reward at the end of an episode, a setup that is known to be difficult to optimise in traditional reinforcement learning. In this work we leverage the fact that the reward model contains more information than just its scalar output, in particular, it calculates an attention map over tokens as part of the transformer architecture. We use these attention weights to redistribute the reward along the whole completion, effectively densifying the signal and highlighting the most important tokens, all without incurring extra computational cost or requiring any additional modelling. We demonstrate that, theoretically, this approach is equivalent to potential-based reward shaping, ensuring that the optimal policy remains unchanged. Empirically, we show that it stabilises training, accelerates the rate of learning, and, in practical cases, may lead to better local optima.",

    "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **1. Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** Existing Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily operate at the single decision (turn) level, limiting their ability to handle multi-turn interactions that require planning or achieving long-term goals.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge:** Human communication and complex AI tasks (e.g., multi-turn dialogue, complex tool use, multi-step games) are inherently sequential and require long-term planning. Single-turn RLHF lacks the adaptive and long-term capabilities needed for such scenarios. Defining suitable reward functions for these complex, multi-turn interactions is challenging, and collecting turn-level preference feedback can introduce biases as the quality of an action often depends on subsequent interactions.\n\n*   **2. Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** This work builds upon RLHF and direct preference learning literature, which typically focuses on single-turn scenarios. It also relates to broader preference-based RL and RL for dialogue systems.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n        *   Most RLHF and direct preference optimization methods (e.g., Nash-MD, IPO-MD) are designed for single-turn problems, where feedback is immediate and per-action.\n        *   They lack mechanisms for multi-turn planning and capturing the long-term consequences of actions.\n        *   Naive adaptation to multi-turn by collecting turn-level feedback is problematic due to context dependency and potential for destructive biases (an action's quality might only be apparent in the full conversation).\n        *   Previous RL for dialogue systems often relies on hand-designed reward functions, which are hard to generalize.\n\n*   **3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** \\cite{shani202491k} extends the RLHF paradigm to the multi-turn setting by considering preference feedback between *two full multi-turn conversations* (trajectories), rather than single turns.\n        *   It formalizes this as a Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with end-of-interaction preference feedback.\n        *   The core algorithm is **Multi-turn Preference Optimization (MTPO)**, a novel policy optimization algorithm for general multi-turn preference-based RL.\n        *   MTPO is based on Mirror Descent (MD) combined with self-play.

Existing methods work by emulating the preferences at the single decision (turn) level, limiting their capabilities in settings that require planning or multi-turn interactions to achieve a long-term goal. In this paper, we address this issue by developing novel methods for Reinforcement Learning (RL) from preference feedback between two full multi-turn conversations. In the tabular setting, we present a novel mirror-descent-based policy optimization algorithm for the general multi-turn preference-based RL problem, and prove its convergence to Nash equilibrium. To evaluate performance, we create a new environment, Education Dialogue, where a teacher agent guides a student in learning a random topic, and show that a deep RL variant of our algorithm outperforms RLHF baselines. Finally, we show that in an environment with explicit rewards, our algorithm recovers the same performance as a reward-based RL baseline, despite relying solely on a weaker preference signal.",

Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** Existing Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily operate at the single decision (turn) level, limiting their ability to handle multi-turn interactions that require planning or achieving long-term goals.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge:** Human communication and complex AI tasks (e.g., multi-turn dialogue, complex tool use, multi-step games) are inherently sequential and require long-term planning. Single-turn RLHF lacks the adaptive and long-term capabilities needed for such scenarios.

    "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review, adhering to the specified citation requirements:\n\n---\n\n### Focused Summary for Literature Review\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the critical challenge of effectively incorporating uncertainty estimation into the reward function learned from human preference data for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), particularly when applied to large language models (LLMs) \\cite{cen2024nef}. This problem exists in both online (adaptive data collection) and offline (pre-collected data) RLHF settings.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**:\n        *   **Importance**: Uncertainty estimation is crucial for achieving near-optimal performance in standard reinforcement learning (RL) and is even more vital in RLHF due to the inherent coarse nature of preference data. It underpins principles like optimism for online exploration and pessimism for offline safety.\n        *   **Challenge**: Standard techniques for constructing confidence intervals, which are typically used to implement optimism or pessimism, become intractable and practically infeasible when dealing with arbitrary policy parameterizations, especially large-scale neural networks like LLMs. Existing RLHF methods (e.g., DPO, Nash-MD, OAIF, IPO) largely omit these principles due to this difficulty \\cite{cen2024nef}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**:\n        *   The original RLHF pipeline decouples reward modeling from RL fine-tuning.\n        *   Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) \\cite{cen2024nef} simplifies this by integrating reward modeling and policy optimization into a single step, leveraging a closed-form solution for the optimal policy in the offline setting.\n        *   Other variants include SLiC, GSHF, Nash-MD, IPO, OAIF, SPO, SPIN, WIND, GPO, and DPOP, categorized into online and offline settings.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   While DPO and its variants simplify the pipeline, they generally **do not incorporate principled uncertainty estimation** (optimism for online exploration or pessimism for offline safety) \\cite{cen2024nef}.\n        *   The primary limitation across the RLHF literature is the **difficulty of constructing confidence intervals for large neural networks**, which prevents the practical and theoretically justified implementation of optimistic/pessimistic principles.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper introduces **Value-Incentivized Preference Optimization (VPO)**, a unified algorithmic framework for both online and offline RLHF \\cite{cen2024nef}.\n        *   VPO regularizes the maximum-likelihood estimate (MLE) of the reward function with the corresponding value function, `J⋆(r) = max_π J(r, π)`.\n        *   This regularization is modulated by a `sign` parameter: `+1` for online settings (implementing optimism) and `-1` for offline settings (implementing pessimism).\n        *   Crucially, VPO **avoids explicit uncertainty estimation** by leveraging the value function as an implicit proxy for uncertainty.\n        *   It directly optimizes the LLM policy, similar to DPO, by exploiting the closed-form solution for the optimal policy and the reward representation inferred from the policy.\n        *   VPO also introduces a \"calibration policy\" (`πcal`) to resolve the inherent shift ambiguity of the Bradley-Terry reward model and provide additional behavior regularization.\n    *   **Novelty**:\n        *   **Implicit Uncertainty Handling**: VPO is novel in implementing optimistic/pessimistic principles under uncertainty *implicitly* through value function regularization, bypassing the intractable explicit confidence interval construction for LLMs \\cite{cen2024nef}.\n        *   **Unified Framework**: It provides a single, theoretically grounded framework for both online and offline RLHF, which traditionally have been treated separately regarding uncertainty.\n        *   **Direct Policy Optimization with Uncertainty**: It combines the simplicity of DPO-like direct policy optimization with principled uncertainty management.\n        *   **Theoretical Guarantees**: VPO provides theoretical regret guarantees for both online and offline settings, matching the rates of their standard RL counterparts that rely on explicit uncertainty estimation \\cite{cen2024nef}.\n        *   **Reward Calibration**: It highlights and leverages the critical role of reward calibration (via `πcal`) for resolving shift ambiguity and enabling additional behavior regularization, offering a theoretical foundation for conservative offline RL and regularized RLHF methods.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithm**: Introduction of VPO, a unified, implicit uncertainty-aware preference optimization algorithm for online and offline RLHF \\cite{cen2024nef}.\n    *   **Methodology**: A novel regularization scheme for reward MLE, `ℓ(r,D) − sign · α · J⋆(r)`, where `J⋆(r)` is the optimal value function for reward `r`, effectively implementing optimism or pessimism without explicit uncertainty quantification.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: VPO admits a practically implementable form suitable for RLHF on LLMs and general deep-learning architectures, maintaining a simpler pipeline akin to DPO.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**:\n        *   Derivation showing that `J⋆(r)` can be expressed in terms of KL divergence between the current policy and the reference/calibration policy, enabling direct policy optimization.\n        *   Theoretical regret guarantees for VPO in both online and offline settings under linear function

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has demonstrated great promise in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference. Depending on the availability of preference data, both online and offline RLHF are active areas of investigation. A key bottleneck is understanding how to incorporate uncertainty estimation in the reward function learned from the preference data for RLHF, regardless of how the preference data is collected. While the principles of optimism or pessimism under uncertainty are well-established in standard reinforcement learning (RL), a practically-implementable and theoretically-grounded form amenable to large language models is not yet available, as standard techniques for constructing confidence intervals become intractable under arbitrary policy parameterizations. In this paper, we introduce a unified approach to online and offline RLHF -- value-incentivized preference optimization (VPO) -- which regularizes the maximum-likelihood estimate of the reward function with the corresponding value function, modulated by a $\\textit{sign}$ to indicate whether the optimism or pessimism is chosen. VPO also directly optimizes the policy with implicit reward modeling, and therefore shares a simpler RLHF pipeline similar to direct preference optimization. Theoretical guarantees of VPO are provided for both online and offline settings, matching the rates of their standard RL counterparts. Moreover, experiments on text summarization and dialog verify the practicality and effectiveness of VPO.",

      "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review, adhering to the specified citation requirements:\n\n---\n\n### Focused Summary for Literature Review\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the critical challenge of effectively incorporating uncertainty estimation into the reward function learned from human preference data for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), particularly when applied to large language models (LLMs) \\cite{cen2024nef}. This problem exists in both online (adaptive data collection) and offline (pre-collected data) RLHF settings.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**:\n        *   **Importance**: Uncertainty estimation is crucial for achieving near-optimal performance in standard reinforcement learning (RL) and is even more vital in RLHF due to the inherent coarse nature of preference data. It underpins principles like optimism for online exploration and pessimism for offline safety.\n        *   **Challenge**: Standard techniques for constructing confidence intervals, which are typically used to implement optimism or pessimism, become intractable and practically infeasible when dealing with arbitrary policy parameterizations, especially large-scale neural networks like LLMs. Existing RLHF methods (e.g., DPO, Nash-MD, OAIF, IPO) largely omit these principles due to this difficulty \\cite{cen2024nef}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**:\n        *   The original RLHF pipeline decouples reward modeling from RL fine-tuning.\n        *   Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) \\cite{cen2024nef} simplifies this by integrating reward modeling and policy optimization into a single step, leveraging a closed-form solution for the optimal policy in the offline setting.\n        *   Other variants include SLiC, GSHF, Nash-MD, IPO, OAIF, SPO, SPIN, WIND, GPO, and DPOP, categorized into online and offline settings.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   While DPO and its variants simplify the pipeline, they generally **do not incorporate principled uncertainty estimation** (optimism for online exploration or pessimism for offline safety) \\cite{cen2024nef}.\n        *   The primary limitation across the RLHF literature is the **difficulty of constructing confidence intervals for large neural networks**, which prevents the practical and theoretically justified implementation of optimistic/pessimistic principles.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper introduces **Value-Incentivized Preference Optimization (VPO)**, a unified algorithmic framework for both online and offline RLHF \\cite{cen2024nef}.\n        *   VPO regularizes the maximum-likelihood estimate (MLE) of the reward function with the corresponding value function, `J⋆(r) = max_π J(r, π)`.\n        *   This regularization is modulated by a `sign` parameter: `+1` for online settings (implementing optimism) and `-1` for offline settings (implementing pessimism).\n        *   Crucially, VPO **avoids explicit uncertainty estimation** by leveraging the value function as an implicit proxy for uncertainty.\n        *   It directly optimizes the LLM policy, similar to DPO, by exploiting the closed-form solution for the optimal policy and the reward representation inferred from the policy.\n        *   VPO also introduces a \"calibration policy\" (`πcal`) to resolve the inherent shift ambiguity of the Bradley-Terry reward model and provide additional behavior regularization.\n    *   **Novelty**:\n        *   **Implicit Uncertainty Handling**: VPO is novel in implementing optimistic/pessimistic principles under uncertainty *implicitly* through value function regularization, bypassing the intractable explicit confidence interval construction for LLMs \\cite{cen2024nef}.\n        *   **Unified Framework**: It provides a single, theoretically grounded framework for both online and offline RLHF, which traditionally have been treated separately regarding uncertainty.\n        *   **Direct Policy Optimization with Uncertainty**: It combines the simplicity of DPO-like direct policy optimization with principled uncertainty management.\n        *   **Theoretical Guarantees**: VPO provides theoretical regret guarantees for both online and offline settings, matching the rates of their standard RL counterparts that rely on explicit uncertainty estimation \\cite{cen2024nef}.\n        *   **Reward Calibration**: It highlights and leverages the critical role of reward calibration (via `πcal`) for resolving shift ambiguity and enabling additional behavior regularization, offering a theoretical foundation for conservative offline RL and regularized RLHF methods.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithm**: Introduction of VPO, a unified, implicit uncertainty-aware preference optimization algorithm for online and offline RLHF \\cite{cen2024nef}.\n    *   **Methodology**: A novel regularization scheme for reward MLE, `ℓ(r,D) − sign · α · J⋆(r)`, where `J⋆(r)` is the optimal value function for reward `r`, effectively implementing optimism or pessimism without explicit uncertainty quantification.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: VPO admits a practically implementable form suitable for RLHF on LLMs and general deep-learning architectures, maintaining a simpler pipeline akin to DPO.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**:\n        *   Derivation showing that `J⋆(r)` can be expressed in terms of KL divergence between the current policy and the reference/calibration policy, enabling direct policy optimization.\n        *   Theoretical regret guarantees for VPO in both online and offline settings under linear function approximation, demonstrating its efficiency and matching rates of standard RL algorithms.\n        *   Elucidation of the role of reward calibration (`πcal`) in resolving reward shift ambiguity and providing a mechanism for behavior regularization, offering a theoretical basis for methods like DPOP and conservative offline RL \\cite{cen2024nef}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**:\n        *   Evaluations on **synthetic bandit problems** to validate theoretical properties.\n        *   Extensive experimental studies on **RLHF for LLMs** \\cite{cen2024nef}.\n            *   **Text summarization** using the TL;DR dataset.\n            *   **Dialog generation** using the ARC-Challenge task.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and

ToM involves understanding agents' beliefs, goals, and mental states, which is crucial for common-sense reasoning and social understanding in human-LLM interactions \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n    *   The problem is important because ToM is a complex cognitive capacity essential for intricate social exchanges and anticipating others' actions, and it relies on inferential reasoning from unobservable information (e.g., hidden mental states) rather than explicit text \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   Previous work on LLM ToM performance has yielded mixed results, with some studies supporting and others questioning their capabilities \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n    *   Limitations of prior solutions include:\n        *   Evaluation primarily on single-word or multiple-option completion tasks, which may not allow LLMs to fully express their reasoning or speculate over possibilities \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n        *   Reliance on zero-shot testing or examples lacking step-by-step reasoning, despite the known context-sensitive nature of LLM output \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n    *   This study positions itself by exploring whether appropriate prompting, specifically in-context learning, can enhance ToM performance in recent LLMs, addressing the limitations of previous evaluation methods \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   The core technical method is the application of various in-context learning (ICL) prompting strategies to boost LLM ToM comprehension \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n    *   The approach investigates four prompting types: (1) Zero-shot (no ICL), (2) Zero-shot with step-by-step (SS) thinking instructions, (3) Two-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, and (4) Two-shot CoT reasoning combined with SS thinking \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n    *   The innovation lies in systematically evaluating the combined and individual effects of these established prompting techniques on ToM tasks, particularly focusing on models trained with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and demonstrating their capacity to unlock latent ToM reasoning abilities without additional training or datasets \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Methods/Techniques**: The paper demonstrates that specific prompting strategies (two-shot CoT and step-by-step thinking, especially in combination) are highly effective in significantly improving ToM reasoning in LLMs \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: It highlights the context-dependent nature of LLM cognitive capacities, showing that performance is not static but can be dramatically enhanced by appropriate input formatting \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.

Each scenario was tested with the four prompting conditions (zero-shot, zero-shot+SS, two-shot CoT, two-shot CoT+SS), and each prompt was run 20 times with model re-initialization \\cite{moghaddam20238is}. Responses were manually labeled for correctness, allowing for complex reasoning in the output \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   **Zero-shot**: GPT-4 achieved the best zero-shot ToM accuracy (nearly 80%), but still fell short of human accuracy (87%) \\cite{moghaddam20238is}. Davinci-2 outperformed Davinci-3 and GPT-3.5-Turbo in zero-shot ToM, with GPT-3.5-Turbo often providing inconclusive responses \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n        *   **Prompted Performance**:\n            *   Step-by-step (SS) thinking enhanced performance for Davinci-3, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and GPT-4 \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n            *   Two-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning significantly improved accuracy for all RLHF-trained models (Davinci-3, GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4) \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n            *   The combination of Two-shot CoT and SS thinking yielded the greatest improvements: Davinci-3 reached 83% (from ~63% zero-shot), GPT-3.5-Turbo reached 91% (from ~50% zero-shot), and GPT-4 achieved a ceiling accuracy of 100% (from ~79% zero-shot) \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n        *   All RLHF-trained models, when appropriately prompted, exceeded 80% ToM accuracy, with GPT-4 surpassing human performance (87%) \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**: The paper acknowledges that a theoretical understanding of *why* these prompting techniques are beneficial is still lacking \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.

ToM involves understanding agents' beliefs, goals, and mental states, which is crucial for common-sense reasoning and social understanding in human-LLM interactions \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n    *   The problem is important because ToM is a complex cognitive capacity essential for intricate social exchanges and anticipating others' actions, and it relies on inferential reasoning from unobservable information (e.g., hidden mental states) rather than explicit text \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   Previous work on LLM ToM performance has yielded mixed results, with some studies supporting and others questioning their capabilities \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n    *   Limitations of prior solutions include:\n        *   Evaluation primarily on single-word or multiple-option completion tasks, which may not allow LLMs to fully express their reasoning or speculate over possibilities \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n        *   Reliance on zero-shot testing or examples lacking step-by-step reasoning, despite the known context-sensitive nature of LLM output \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n    *   This study positions itself by exploring whether appropriate prompting, specifically in-context learning, can enhance ToM performance in recent LLMs, addressing the limitations of previous evaluation methods \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   The core technical method is the application of various in-context learning (ICL) prompting strategies to boost LLM ToM comprehension \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n    *   The approach investigates four prompting types: (1) Zero-shot (no ICL), (2) Zero-shot with step-by-step (SS) thinking instructions, (3) Two-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, and (4) Two-shot CoT reasoning combined with SS thinking \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n    *   The innovation lies in systematically evaluating the combined and individual effects of these established prompting techniques on ToM tasks, particularly focusing on models trained with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and demonstrating their capacity to unlock latent ToM reasoning abilities without additional training or datasets \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Methods/Techniques**: The paper demonstrates that specific prompting strategies (two-shot CoT and step-by-step thinking, especially in combination) are highly effective in significantly improving ToM reasoning in LLMs \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: It highlights the context-dependent nature of LLM cognitive capacities, showing that performance is not static but can be dramatically enhanced by appropriate input formatting \\cite{moghaddam20238is}. The study also suggests that the observed performance increases are not due to simple mimicry of reasoning steps but generalize across distinct reasoning cases \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n    *   **Empirical Finding**: A key finding is that LLMs trained with RLHF (Davinci-3, GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4) show substantial improvements in ToM accuracy via in-context learning, with GPT-4 achieving 100% accuracy under optimal prompting \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: The study evaluated four OpenAI GPT models (GPT-4, Davinci-2, Davinci-3, GPT-3.5-Turbo) on 16 ToM scenarios and 16 control (Photo) scenarios adapted from human fMRI studies \\cite{moghaddam20238is}. Each scenario was tested with the four prompting conditions (zero-shot, zero-shot+SS, two-shot CoT, two-shot CoT+SS), and each prompt was run 20 times with model re-initialization \\cite{moghaddam20238is}. Responses were manually labeled for correctness, allowing for complex reasoning in the output \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   **Zero-shot**: GPT-4 achieved the best zero-shot ToM accuracy (nearly 80%), but still fell short of human accuracy (87%) \\cite{moghaddam20238is}. Davinci-2 outperformed Davinci-3 and GPT-3.5-Turbo in zero-shot ToM, with GPT-3.5-Turbo often providing inconclusive responses \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n        *   **Prompted Performance**:\n            *   Step-by-step (SS) thinking enhanced performance for Davinci-3, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and GPT-4 \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n            *   Two-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning significantly improved accuracy for all RLHF-trained models (Davinci-3, GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4) \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n            *   The combination of Two-shot CoT and SS thinking yielded the greatest improvements: Davinci-3 reached 83% (from ~63% zero-shot), GPT-3.5-Turbo reached 91% (from ~50% zero-shot), and GPT-4 achieved a ceiling accuracy of 100% (from ~79% zero-shot) \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n        *   All RLHF-trained models, when appropriately prompted, exceeded 80% ToM accuracy, with GPT-4 surpassing human performance (87%) \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**: The paper acknowledges that a theoretical understanding of *why* these prompting techniques are beneficial is still lacking \\cite{moghaddam20238is}. The study focuses on specific OpenAI GPT models, and findings may not directly generalize to all LLM architectures or training paradigms \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The research is confined to ToM comprehension questions and specific in-context learning prompting methods \\cite{moghaddam20238is}. While inferential reasoning is a broader implication, the direct validation is within the ToM domain.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art**: This work significantly advances the understanding of LLM reasoning capabilities by demonstrating that appropriate prompting can unlock and dramatically enhance complex cognitive functions like ToM, pushing LLM performance beyond human benchmarks in specific tasks \\cite{moghaddam20238is}. It challenges previous criticisms of LLM ToM abilities by showing their context-dependent nature \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: The findings suggest that current LLMs possess latent reasoning capacities that can be accessed through flexible, inference-time interventions (prompting) rather than requiring extensive retraining \\cite{moghaddam20238is}. This has profound implications for developing more reliable and socially intelligent AI systems, guiding future research into optimal prompting strategies, and exploring the underlying mechanisms of LLM reasoning \\cite{moghaddam20238is}.",

In this work, we are going to make a systematic review of the most up-to-date state of knowledge on RL-enhanced LLMs, attempting to consolidate and analyze the rapidly growing research in this field, helping researchers understand the current challenges and advancements. Specifically, we (1) detail the basics of RL; (2) introduce popular RL-enhanced LLMs; (3) review researches on two widely-used reward model-based RL techniques: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF); and (4) explore Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a set of methods that bypass the reward model to directly use human preference data for aligning LLM outputs with human expectations. We will also point out current challenges and deficiencies of existing methods and suggest some avenues for further improvements.

This leads to less data-efficient RMs prone to robustness issues like reward hacking \\cite{yu20249l0}. While LLM-as-a-judge offers critiques, it often provides discrete scores and can be biased or misled \\cite{yu20249l0}.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** The limitations of standard RMs hinder the quality of feedback signals in RLHF, leading to suboptimal policy updates.

Recent generative reward modeling approaches incorporate critiques from teacher models or use joint training, often relying on strong teacher LLMs \\cite{yu20249l0}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:** Standard RMs lack interpretability and robustness \\cite{yu20249l0}. LLM-as-a-judge can introduce bias \\cite{yu20249l0}.

The consistency-guided filtering and quality-aware refinement techniques are novel for ensuring synthetic critique quality. The dynamic weight scheduling strategy effectively addresses the challenge of combining diverse critique generation with stable reward modeling \\cite{yu20249l0}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods:** The Critic-RM framework itself, including the instance-level critique filtering, quality-aware critique refinement (summarization and ranking), and the weight scheduling strategy for joint learning \\cite{yu20249l0}.\n    *   **System Design:** Utilizes a single instruction-finetuned LLM backbone with separate heads for critique generation and reward modeling \\cite{yu20249l0}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights:** Decomposes the reward model learning objective into preference modeling loss with critiques and critique generation loss, providing a principled way to integrate critiques \\cite{yu20249l0}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** Extensive experiments on preference ranking benchmarks, including RewardBench and three out-of-distribution reward modeling tasks \\cite{yu20249l0}.

Our approach is fully off-policy, scales like supervised learning, and eliminates the need for high-variance policy gradients or dynamic programming. Theoretically, CPL recovers optimal policies and learns consistent advantage functions. Experimentally, CPL matches or surpasses RL baselines on high-dimensional robotic manipulation tasks (MetaWorld), achieving 1.6x faster training and 4x greater parameter efficiency.

      "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a popular paradigm for aligning models with human intent. Typically RLHF algorithms operate in two phases: first, use human preferences to learn a reward function and second, align the model by optimizing the learned reward via reinforcement learning (RL). This paradigm assumes that human preferences are distributed according to reward, but recent work suggests that they instead follow the regret under the user's optimal policy. Thus, learning a reward function from feedback is not only based on a flawed assumption of human preference, but also leads to unwieldy optimization challenges that stem from policy gradients or bootstrapping in the RL phase. Because of these optimization challenges, contemporary RLHF methods restrict themselves to contextual bandit settings (e.g., as in large language models) or limit observation dimensionality (e.g., state-based robotics). We overcome these limitations by introducing a new family of algorithms for optimizing behavior from human feedback using the regret-based model of human preferences. Using the principle of maximum entropy, we derive Contrastive Preference Learning (CPL), an algorithm for learning optimal policies from preferences without learning reward functions, circumventing the need for RL. CPL is fully off-policy, uses only a simple contrastive objective, and can be applied to arbitrary MDPs. This enables CPL to elegantly scale to high-dimensional and sequential RLHF problems while being simpler than prior methods.",

    "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review, emphasizing technical innovations and empirical validation:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the challenge of \"reward model overoptimization\" in Large Language Model (LLM) alignment, particularly when using *composite reward models* (RMs). Overoptimization occurs when maximizing an RM beyond a certain point leads to a decrease in actual human-judged quality.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: RMs are imperfect proxies for human preferences. In composite RMs, it's difficult to appropriately weight individual components, and each component may overoptimize at different points. Traditional early stopping is expensive and ineffective for composite RMs, as it loses information about individual component performance. The correlation between component RMs further complicates identifying optimal operating points \\cite{moskovitz2023slz}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: This work builds upon Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for LLM alignment, acknowledging the increasing use of composite RMs (e.g., Ramamurthy et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2023). It directly addresses the overoptimization phenomenon identified by Gao et al. (2022).\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Prior work on overoptimization (Gao et al., 2022) suggested expensive early stopping. For composite RMs, previous methods relied on fixed, manually tuned weightings (e.g., Ramamurthy et al., 2022), which fail to account for the dynamic nature of overoptimization across different reward components and their interactions \\cite{moskovitz2023slz}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes using **constrained reinforcement learning (CRL)** to prevent LLM agents from exceeding \"proxy points\" – the thresholds where individual RMs stop being effective proxies for human evaluation. Instead of fixed weights, the method dynamically adapts component RM influence using **Lagrange multipliers** \\cite{moskovitz2023slz}.\n    *   **Novelty**:\n        *   It reformulates the RLHF objective as a constrained optimization problem, where component RM values are constrained to reach but not exceed their identified proxy points.\n        *   It introduces a method to dynamically learn the weights (Lagrange multipliers) for component RMs, allowing for adaptive modulation of their influence during training.\n        *   A significant innovation is an **adaptive, gradient-free optimization method** that identifies these proxy points *during a single RL training run*, drastically reducing the computational cost compared to methods requiring multiple runs \\cite{moskovitz2023slz}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**:\n        *   A constrained RLHF framework that integrates \"proxy points\" as explicit constraints into the optimization objective, preventing overoptimization of individual reward components.\n        *   Dynamic weighting of composite reward components through learned Lagrange multipliers, which naturally express the relative importance of each RM in satisfying its constraint.\n        *   An adaptive, gradient-free optimization technique for efficient, *on-the-fly* identification of proxy points during a single RL training run \\cite{moskovitz2023slz}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights**: Provides analysis demonstrating that the correlation between component RMs significantly influences the location of their respective proxy points, highlighting the complexity of multi-objective alignment \\cite{moskovitz2023slz}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: A case study was performed on dialogue generation using the DailyDialog dataset with a GPT-2 base LLM. Two component RMs were used: METEOR score (lexical quality) and an intent matching score. A composite evaluation metric (averaged lexical quality and diversity metrics) served as the ground truth for human evaluation \\cite{moskovitz2023slz}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   Empirically demonstrates overoptimization in both individual and composite RMs, showing evaluation scores initially increase then decline.\n        *   Shows that the optimal joint proxy point for composite RMs differs from individual proxy points, confirming the influence of component correlation.\n        *   The proposed constrained RL approaches (e.g., PPO-SAT, ξ-PPO) successfully prevent overoptimization, leading to improved evaluation performance compared to standard PPO baselines.\n        *   The adaptive, gradient-free method effectively identifies proxy points dynamically, achieving comparable performance to multi-run methods while significantly reducing computational expense \\cite{moskovitz2023slz}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The method relies on some access to a \"ground-truth\" evaluation metric (or a proxy for human ratings) to identify the proxy points. The gradient-free optimization method for dynamic proxy point identification is an approximation.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The empirical validation is a case study focused on dialogue generation with two specific component RMs and GPT-2.

      "abstract": "Large language models are typically aligned with human preferences by optimizing $\\textit{reward models}$ (RMs) fitted to human feedback. However, human preferences are multi-faceted, and it is increasingly common to derive reward from a composition of simpler reward models which each capture a different aspect of language quality. This itself presents a challenge, as it is difficult to appropriately weight these component RMs when combining them. Compounding this difficulty, because any RM is only a proxy for human evaluation, this process is vulnerable to $\\textit{overoptimization}$, wherein past a certain point, accumulating higher reward is associated with worse human ratings. In this paper, we perform, to our knowledge, the first study on overoptimization in composite RMs, showing that correlation between component RMs has a significant effect on the locations of these points. We then introduce an approach to solve this issue using constrained reinforcement learning as a means of preventing the agent from exceeding each RM's threshold of usefulness. Our method addresses the problem of weighting component RMs by learning dynamic weights, naturally expressed by Lagrange multipliers. As a result, each RM stays within the range at which it is an effective proxy, improving evaluation performance. Finally, we introduce an adaptive method using gradient-free optimization to identify and optimize towards these points during a single run.",

      "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review, emphasizing technical innovations and empirical validation:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the challenge of \"reward model overoptimization\" in Large Language Model (LLM) alignment, particularly when using *composite reward models* (RMs). Overoptimization occurs when maximizing an RM beyond a certain point leads to a decrease in actual human-judged quality.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: RMs are imperfect proxies for human preferences. In composite RMs, it's difficult to appropriately weight individual components, and each component may overoptimize at different points. Traditional early stopping is expensive and ineffective for composite RMs, as it loses information about individual component performance. The correlation between component RMs further complicates identifying optimal operating points \\cite{moskovitz2023slz}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: This work builds upon Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for LLM alignment, acknowledging the increasing use of composite RMs (e.g., Ramamurthy et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2023). It directly addresses the overoptimization phenomenon identified by Gao et al. (2022).\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Prior work on overoptimization (Gao et al., 2022) suggested expensive early stopping. For composite RMs, previous methods relied on fixed, manually tuned weightings (e.g., Ramamurthy et al., 2022), which fail to account for the dynamic nature of overoptimization across different reward components and their interactions \\cite{moskovitz2023slz}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes using **constrained reinforcement learning (CRL)** to prevent LLM agents from exceeding \"proxy points\" – the thresholds where individual RMs stop being effective proxies for human evaluation. Instead of fixed weights, the method dynamically adapts component RM influence using **Lagrange multipliers** \\cite{moskovitz2023slz}.\n    *   **Novelty**:\n        *   It reformulates the RLHF objective as a constrained optimization problem, where component RM values are constrained to reach but not exceed their identified proxy points.\n        *   It introduces a method to dynamically learn the weights (Lagrange multipliers) for component RMs, allowing for adaptive modulation of their influence during training.\n        *   A significant innovation is an **adaptive, gradient-free optimization method** that identifies these proxy points *during a single RL training run*, drastically reducing the computational cost compared to methods requiring multiple runs \\cite{moskovitz2023slz}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**:\n        *   A constrained RLHF framework that integrates \"proxy points\" as explicit constraints into the optimization objective, preventing overoptimization of individual reward components.\n        *   Dynamic weighting of composite reward components through learned Lagrange multipliers, which naturally express the relative importance of each RM in satisfying its constraint.\n        *   An adaptive, gradient-free optimization technique for efficient, *on-the-fly* identification of proxy points during a single RL training run \\cite{moskovitz2023slz}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights**: Provides analysis demonstrating that the correlation between component RMs significantly influences the location of their respective proxy points, highlighting the complexity of multi-objective alignment \\cite{moskovitz2023slz}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: A case study was performed on dialogue generation using the DailyDialog dataset with a GPT-2 base LLM. Two component RMs were used: METEOR score (lexical quality) and an intent matching score. A composite evaluation metric (averaged lexical quality and diversity metrics) served as the ground truth for human evaluation \\cite{moskovitz2023slz}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   Empirically demonstrates overoptimization in both individual and composite RMs, showing evaluation scores initially increase then decline.\n        *   Shows that the optimal joint proxy point for composite RMs differs from individual proxy points, confirming the influence of component correlation.\n        *   The proposed constrained RL approaches (e.g., PPO-SAT, ξ-PPO) successfully prevent overoptimization, leading to improved evaluation performance compared to standard PPO baselines.\n        *   The adaptive, gradient-free method effectively identifies proxy points dynamically, achieving comparable performance to multi-run methods while significantly reducing computational expense \\cite{moskovitz2023slz}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The method relies on some access to a \"ground-truth\" evaluation metric (or a proxy for human ratings) to identify the proxy points. The gradient-free optimization method for dynamic proxy point identification is an approximation.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The empirical validation is a case study focused on dialogue generation with two specific component RMs and GPT-2. While the principles are general, further validation would be needed for more complex LLM architectures, a larger number of component RMs, or different downstream tasks \\cite{moskovitz2023slz}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: This work advances the technical state-of-the-art in LLM alignment by providing a principled and dynamic solution to reward model overoptimization in multi-objective settings.

This leads to degenerate outputs (e.g., repetitive, overly verbose) and degrades model alignment \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** RLHF is crucial for aligning LLMs with human values. Reward hacking undermines the reliability and effectiveness of RLHF, making it challenging to develop truly aligned and robust LLMs. While reward shaping is used, a systematic investigation into effective shaping techniques and their underlying principles is lacking \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** The paper acknowledges various existing mitigation strategies for reward hacking, including reward ensemble techniques (e.g., WARM \\cite{fu2025hl3}), information bottlenecks, constrained RLHF, methods separating quality and length rewards (e.g., ODIN \\cite{fu2025hl3}), regularization terms (e.g., Reg \\cite{fu2025hl3}), and diverse dataset curation. It also notes other reward shaping methods like log-sigmoid centering (LSC \\cite{fu2025hl3}), contrastive rewards, and leave-one-out rewards \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:** Existing reward shaping methods are often not explicitly designed to mitigate reward hacking, nor do they provide a strong theoretical justification for their mechanisms. Many approaches focus on the reward model itself or data curation, rather than principled reward shaping during the RL training phase \\cite{fu2025hl3}. This work aims to fill the gap by providing a systematic analysis and a theoretically justified solution directly addressing reward hacking through shaping.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper proposes two key design principles for effective reward shaping in PPO-based RLHF:\n        1.  The RL reward should be bounded.\n        2.  The RL reward benefits from rapid initial growth followed by gradual convergence \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n        Guided by these principles, the authors introduce **Preference As Reward (PAR)**, a novel reward shaping technique. PAR applies a sigmoid function to the *centered reward* (the difference between the proxy reward `r` and a reference reward `r_ref`), i.e., `r_RL = sigmoid(r - r_ref)` \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:**\n        *   **Principled Design:** PAR is explicitly designed based on identified principles to mitigate reward hacking, unlike many prior shaping methods.\n        *   **Sigmoid on Centered Reward:** The use of a sigmoid on a centered reward is novel for this specific problem. The sigmoid's properties (boundedness, steepest slope at zero, gradual convergence) directly address the identified principles for stable and effective learning \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n        *   **Theoretical Justification:** The paper provides theoretical analysis demonstrating that PAR's bounded rewards stabilize critic training by constraining return variance (Theorem 3.1) and that the sigmoid function minimizes policy gradient variance (Theorem 3.2) \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n        *   **Preference Interpretation:** PAR's functional form is shown to resemble the Bradley-Terry model, interpreting the RL reward as the relative preference of the policy response over a reference response, as determined by the reward model \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods:**\n        *   Introduction of **Preference As Reward (PAR)**, a novel reward shaping technique that applies a sigmoid function to centered rewards to mitigate reward hacking \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis:**\n        *   Identification and validation of two key design principles for effective reward shaping: (1) bounded RL rewards and (2) rapid initial growth followed by gradual convergence \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n        *   Theoretical proof that PAR's bounded rewards lead to an upper-bounded return variance, stabilizing critic training (Theorem 3.1) \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n        *   Theoretical proof that the sigmoid function minimizes policy gradient variance within a family of C1, strictly increasing functions (Theorem 3.2), justifying its selection \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n        *   Analysis of PAR's connection to the underlying preferences encoded in the reward model, interpreting the shaped reward as a preference score \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:**\n        *   Validation of the two design principles using varying KL penalties, reward ceilings, and different sigmoid-like functions (centered vs. uncentered) \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n        *   Comparison of PAR against seven baseline reward hacking mitigation methods (WARM, ODIN, Reg, Meanstd, Clip, Minmax, LSC) \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n        *   Evaluation of PAR's data efficiency and robustness against reward hacking over extended training \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n    *   **Models & Datasets:** Experiments were conducted on Gemma2-2B and Llama3-8B base models, using Ultrafeedback-Binarized and HH-RLHF datasets \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics:**\n        *   **Training Progress:** Proxy Reward and Winrate (policy model vs. SFT model, evaluated by DeepSeek-V3) \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n        *   **Benchmarks:** AlpacaEval 2.0 and MT-Bench (using 6 metrics, mostly evaluated by DeepSeek-V3) \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n    *   **Comparison Results:**\n        *   **Principle Validation:** Limiting excessive rewards (e.g., higher KL penalty, lower reward ceiling) significantly mitigates reward hacking.

While it provides theoretical justifications, the empirical validation is limited to two base models and two datasets. The effectiveness of PAR might vary with different RL algorithms or more complex reward models.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** PAR is presented as a reward shaping technique, which is orthogonal to other reward hacking mitigation strategies like robust reward model training or diverse dataset construction. Its primary scope is to enhance the stability and alignment of RLHF by addressing reward function exploitation during the reinforcement learning phase \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** The paper significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing a systematic investigation into reward shaping for RLHF, establishing clear design principles, and proposing a theoretically grounded and empirically superior method (PAR) to mitigate reward hacking \\cite{fu2025hl3}.

The sigmoid's properties (boundedness, steepest slope at zero, gradual convergence) directly address the identified principles for stable and effective learning \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n        *   **Theoretical Justification:** The paper provides theoretical analysis demonstrating that PAR's bounded rewards stabilize critic training by constraining return variance (Theorem 3.1) and that the sigmoid function minimizes policy gradient variance (Theorem 3.2) \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n        *   **Preference Interpretation:** PAR's functional form is shown to resemble the Bradley-Terry model, interpreting the RL reward as the relative preference of the policy response over a reference response, as determined by the reward model \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods:**\n        *   Introduction of **Preference As Reward (PAR)**, a novel reward shaping technique that applies a sigmoid function to centered rewards to mitigate reward hacking \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis:**\n        *   Identification and validation of two key design principles for effective reward shaping: (1) bounded RL rewards and (2) rapid initial growth followed by gradual convergence \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n        *   Theoretical proof that PAR's bounded rewards lead to an upper-bounded return variance, stabilizing critic training (Theorem 3.1) \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n        *   Theoretical proof that the sigmoid function minimizes policy gradient variance within a family of C1, strictly increasing functions (Theorem 3.2), justifying its selection \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n        *   Analysis of PAR's connection to the underlying preferences encoded in the reward model, interpreting the shaped reward as a preference score \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:**\n        *   Validation of the two design principles using varying KL penalties, reward ceilings, and different sigmoid-like functions (centered vs. uncentered) \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n        *   Comparison of PAR against seven baseline reward hacking mitigation methods (WARM, ODIN, Reg, Meanstd, Clip, Minmax, LSC) \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n        *   Evaluation of PAR's data efficiency and robustness against reward hacking over extended training \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n    *   **Models & Datasets:** Experiments were conducted on Gemma2-2B and Llama3-8B base models, using Ultrafeedback-Binarized and HH-RLHF datasets \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics:**\n        *   **Training Progress:** Proxy Reward and Winrate (policy model vs. SFT model, evaluated by DeepSeek-V3) \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n        *   **Benchmarks:** AlpacaEval 2.0 and MT-Bench (using 6 metrics, mostly evaluated by DeepSeek-V3) \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n    *   **Comparison Results:**\n        *   **Principle Validation:** Limiting excessive rewards (e.g., higher KL penalty, lower reward ceiling) significantly mitigates reward hacking. Centered sigmoid-like functions achieve higher win rates than uncentered ones, supporting the rapid initial growth principle \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n        *   **Superior Performance:** PAR consistently outperforms competing approaches, achieving a win rate of at least 5 percentage points higher than baselines on the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n        *   **Data Efficiency:** PAR requires only a single reference reward for optimal performance \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n        *   **Robustness:** PAR exhibits remarkable robustness against reward hacking, maintaining performance even after two full epochs of training \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The paper focuses on PPO-based RLHF and the specific properties of sigmoid-like functions. While it provides theoretical justifications, the empirical validation is limited to two base models and two datasets. The effectiveness of PAR might vary with different RL algorithms or more complex reward models.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** PAR is presented as a reward shaping technique, which is orthogonal to other reward hacking mitigation strategies like robust reward model training or diverse dataset construction. Its primary scope is to enhance the stability and alignment of RLHF by addressing reward function exploitation during the reinforcement learning phase \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** The paper significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing a systematic investigation into reward shaping for RLHF, establishing clear design principles, and proposing a theoretically grounded and empirically superior method (PAR) to mitigate reward hacking \\cite{fu2025hl3}. It moves beyond ad-hoc shaping techniques to a principled approach.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:**\n        *   **Improved RLHF Stability:** PAR's ability to stabilize critic training and minimize policy gradient variance can lead to more robust and reliable RLHF training processes \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n        *   **Enhanced LLM Alignment:** By effectively mitigating reward hacking, PAR contributes to better alignment of LLMs with human intentions, leading to more trustworthy and useful models \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n        *   **Foundation for Future Shaping:** The identified design principles and theoretical analysis provide a strong foundation for developing and evaluating future reward shaping techniques in RLHF and other reward-driven learning systems \\cite{fu2025hl3}.\n        *   **Data Efficiency:** PAR's data efficiency (requiring only a single reference reward) can reduce computational costs and simplify the RLHF pipeline \\cite{fu2025hl3}.",

The gold-standard approach is to run a full RLHF training pipeline and directly probe downstream LLM performance. However, this process is prohibitively expensive. To address this, we build a predictive model of downstream LLM performance by evaluating the reward model on proxy tasks. These proxy tasks consist of a large-scale human preference and a verifiable correctness preference dataset, in which we measure 12 metrics across 12 domains. To investigate which reward model metrics are most correlated to gold-standard RLHF outcomes, we launch an end-to-end RLHF experiment on a large-scale crowdsourced human preference platform to view real reward model downstream performance as ground truth. Ultimately, we compile our data and findings into Preference Proxy Evaluations (PPE), the first reward model benchmark explicitly linked to post-RLHF real-world human preference performance, which we open-source for public use and further development.

This bias stems from its Kullback–Leibler (KL)-based regularization in the optimization objective.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**:\n        *   LLMs increasingly influence decision-making, making accurate alignment with human preferences crucial for fairness, mitigating biased outputs, and economically sound decisions.\n        *   Human preferences are inherently diverse, yet LLMs often exhibit significant biases, disproportionately favoring dominant viewpoints (e.g., assigning over 99% probability to a dominant opinion), failing to capture population diversity.\n        *   The paper highlights that this algorithmic bias can lead to \"preference collapse,\" where minority preferences are virtually disregarded, even when the reward model perfectly represents human preferences (an \"oracle\" reward model). This is a critical challenge as it implies the alignment mechanism itself is flawed, not just the reward model or data.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Standard RLHF uses a KL penalty against a reference model (often the SFT model) to prevent over-optimization. \\cite{xiao2024ro4} directly critiques this KL-based regularization as the source of algorithmic bias.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   Prior research often attributed LLM biases to the insufficiency of a single reward model for complex human preferences (e.g., \\cite{chakraborty2024reward, zhong2024single}) or overfitting issues in reward model training due to limited data (e.g., \\cite{song2023reward, schulman2023rlhf}).\n        *   \\cite{xiao2024ro4} distinguishes its findings by demonstrating that the algorithmic bias persists *even when the reward model is an oracle*, meaning it perfectly captures human preferences.\n        *   Simple mitigation strategies like early stopping in standard RLHF are deemed insufficient because the \"target\" of standard RLHF is inherently biased.\n        *   The paper also shows that merely replacing KL divergence with a general f-divergence does not eliminate this algorithmic bias.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: \\cite{xiao2024ro4} introduces **Preference Matching (PM) RLHF**, a novel approach designed to provably align LLMs with the preference distribution of the reward model under the Bradley–Terry–Luce (BTL)/Plackett–Luce (PL) model.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   **Preference Matching Definition**: A policy is \"preference matching\" if its output probabilities for any pair of responses directly reflect the target human preference distribution (e.g., if 60% prefer y1 over y2, then $\\pi(y_1|x) / (\\pi(y_1|x) + \\pi(y_2|x)) = 0.6$).\n        *   **Derivation of PM Regularizer**: The core innovation is deriving a novel PM regularizer. This is achieved by solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that represents a necessary condition for the regularizer to achieve the preference matching property.\n        *   **Form of Regularizer**: The derived regularizer takes the form of the negative logarithm of the LLM’s policy probability distribution over responses. In expectation, this term becomes the Shannon entropy.\n        *   **Balancing Act**: This regularizer helps the LLM balance reward maximization with response diversification, preventing the collapse to dominant preferences.\n        *   **Conditional PM RLHF**: For practical implementation in natural language generation, a conditional variant of PM RLHF is introduced to address numerical challenges.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**:\n        *   Identification and theoretical demonstration of an inherent algorithmic bias in standard KL-regularized RLHF, leading to \"preference collapse.\"\n        *   Introduction of Preference Matching (PM) RLHF, a new alignment algorithm.\n        *   Derivation of a novel Preference Matching regularizer by solving an ordinary differential equation.\n        *   Development of a conditional variant of PM RLHF tailored for natural language generation.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**:\n        *   Formal definition of \"Preference Matching\" for LLM policies.\n        *   Proof that the derived regularizer is both necessary and sufficient to achieve preference matching with the reward model under the BTL/PL model.\n        *   Theoretical demonstration that the bias in standard RLHF persists even with an oracle reward model and is not resolved by general f-divergences.\n        *   The PM RLHF approach provides provable statistical guarantees for alignment.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: \\cite{xiao2024ro4} empirically validated conditional PM RLHF by fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for both standard RLHF and their proposed method.\n    *   **Models Used**: OPT (Zhang et al., 2022) and Llama-family (Touvron et al., 2023) models (specifically Llama-2-7B and OPT-1.3B).\n    *   **Tasks/Datasets**: Experiments were conducted on tasks involving preferences in \"Helpfulness and Harmlessness\" (using the Anthropic HH-RLHF dataset) and \"Summarization\" (using the TL;DR dataset).\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**: A new metric, **Preference Matching Divergence (PMD)**, was introduced, defined as the KL divergence between the aligned model's policy and the reward model's preference distribution ($D_{KL}(\\pi_\\phi || \\pi_{RM})$). A lower PMD indicates better alignment.\n    *   **Comparison Results**:\n        *   For **Llama-2-7B**: Standard RLHF yielded a PMD of 2.23. PM RLHF reduced this to 1.57, demonstrating an approximate **29% improvement** in alignment.\n        *   For **OPT-1.3B**: Standard RLHF resulted in a PMD of 1.16. PM RLHF decreased this to 0.68, showing an approximate **41% improvement** in alignment.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The provable alignment guarantees of PM RLHF are established under the assumption of the Bradley–Terry–Luce/Plackett–Luce model for human preferences. While widely used, this model has its own assumptions.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The conditional PM RLHF variant is specifically tailored to natural language generation, addressing numerical challenges in this domain. The general PM RLHF framework could potentially be applied to other domains where preference matching is desired, but the conditional variant is optimized for text.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: \\cite{xiao2024ro4} significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in LLM alignment by identifying and providing a principled solution to a fundamental algorithmic bias in standard RLHF. It shifts the understanding of bias origins from solely data/reward model issues to the core optimization objective itself.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n        *   **Fairness and Robustness**: The work provides a theoretical and practical framework for developing more fair and robust LLMs that accurately reflect diverse human preferences, rather than collapsing to dominant ones.\n        *   **Algorithmic Design**: It encourages a deeper re-evaluation of regularization techniques in RLHF and similar alignment procedures, potentially leading to new families of alignment algorithms.\n        *   **Theoretical Foundations**: The use of ODEs to derive optimal regularizers offers a novel mathematical approach to designing policy optimization objectives.\n        *   **Evaluation Metrics**: The introduction of Preference Matching Divergence provides a valuable new metric for quantitatively assessing alignment quality beyond traditional reward maximization.",
    "intriguing_abstract": "The pervasive influence of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates their accurate alignment with diverse human preferences. However, we uncover a fundamental algorithmic bias in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), the cornerstone of LLM alignment. This bias, rooted in its Kullback–Leibler (KL) regularization, leads to \"preference collapse,\" where LLMs disproportionately favor dominant opinions, effectively disregarding minority viewpoints. Crucially, this collapse persists even with an oracle reward model, highlighting a flaw in the alignment mechanism itself, not just the data or reward model.\n\nTo address this, we introduce **Preference Matching (PM) RLHF**, a novel framework designed for provable alignment with the *distribution* of human preferences under the Bradley–Terry–Luce (BTL) model. Our core innovation is the derivation of a new PM regularizer by solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE), which ensures the LLM's policy directly reflects target preference probabilities. Empirical validation on Llama-2-7B and OPT-1.3B models demonstrates significant improvements, reducing **Preference Matching Divergence (PMD)** by up to 41% compared to standard RLHF. This work redefines the understanding of LLM bias, offering a principled path towards more fair, robust, and truly preference-aligned AI.",

However, we argue that the predominant approach for aligning LLMs with human preferences through a reward model -- reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) -- suffers from an inherent algorithmic bias due to its Kullback--Leibler-based regularization in optimization. In extreme cases, this bias could lead to a phenomenon we term preference collapse, where minority preferences are virtually disregarded. To mitigate this algorithmic bias, we introduce preference matching (PM) RLHF, a novel approach that provably aligns LLMs with the preference distribution of the reward model under the Bradley--Terry--Luce/Plackett--Luce model. Central to our approach is a PM regularizer that takes the form of the negative logarithm of the LLM's policy probability distribution over responses, which helps the LLM balance response diversification and reward maximization. Notably, we obtain this regularizer by solving an ordinary differential equation that is necessary for the PM property. For practical implementation, we introduce a conditional variant of PM RLHF that is tailored to natural language generation. Finally, we empirically validate the effectiveness of conditional PM RLHF through experiments on the OPT and Llama-family models, demonstrating a 29% to 41% improvement in alignment with human preferences, as measured by a certain metric, compared to standard RLHF.",

This trade-off is a significant bottleneck, especially for Reinforcement Learning (RL) in LLMs, which requires high-quality, open-ended problems with uniquely verifiable, closed-form solutions to effectively train reasoning capabilities.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** Mathematics is a critical testing ground for advanced reasoning techniques in LLMs. While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) can improve performance, it often leads to memorization and poor generalization, with models frequently achieving correct answers through incorrect reasoning steps. RL training, conversely, has shown promise in yielding models with better generalization by emphasizing the exploration and refinement of reasoning strategies. The challenge is curating a dataset that is both large-scale and meets the stringent quality requirements for RL, specifically by providing open-ended problems (to prevent guessing) and verifiable solutions.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** The work builds upon and contrasts with existing math datasets such as GSM8k \\cite{albalak2025wyc}, MATH \\cite{albalak2025wyc}, HARP \\cite{albalak2025wyc}, Omni-MATH \\cite{albalak2025wyc}, and NuminaMath \\cite{albalak2025wyc}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n        *   **Quantity vs. Quality:** Datasets like GSM8k (8,000 problems) and MATH (12,000 problems) are high-quality and human-written but are too small for scalable RL training.\n        *   **Quality Issues:** Larger datasets, such as NuminaMath \\cite{albalak2025wyc}, often suffer from quality issues including duplicate problems, incomplete solutions, and unverified machine-generated content, hindering their utility for RL.\n        *   **Unsuitability for RL:** Many existing datasets contain a high proportion of multiple-choice questions. These are problematic for RL as models can guess the correct answer without performing the necessary reasoning, undermining the goal of training for robust reasoning.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** `Big-Math` \\cite{albalak2025wyc} is created by rigorously filtering, cleaning, and curating openly available math datasets. The process is guided by three desiderata for RL suitability: (1) problems with uniquely verifiable solutions, (2) open-ended problem formulations, and (3) problems with closed-form solutions.\n    *   **Novelty & Differentiation:**\n        *   **Human-in-the-Loop Filtering Pipeline:** A key innovation is the iterative human-in-the-loop methodology applied to both source-specific and source-agnostic filters. This ensures high data quality, with filters achieving over 90% F1 score through multiple rounds of manual verification and refinement.\n        *   **`Big-Math-Reformulated` Dataset:** The paper introduces a novel subset of 47,000 problems, `Big-Math-Reformulated` \\cite{albalak2025wyc}, created by systematically reformulating existing closed-ended (multiple-choice) questions into open-ended formats.

However, existing open math datasets either contain a small collection of high-quality, human-written problems or a large corpus of machine-generated problems of uncertain quality, forcing researchers to choose between quality and quantity. In this work, we present Big-Math, a dataset of over 250,000 high-quality math questions with verifiable answers, purposefully made for reinforcement learning (RL). To create Big-Math, we rigorously filter, clean, and curate openly available datasets, extracting questions that satisfy our three desiderata: (1) problems with uniquely verifiable solutions, (2) problems that are open-ended, (3) and problems with a closed-form solution. To ensure the quality of Big-Math, we manually verify each step in our filtering process. Based on the findings from our filtering process, we introduce 47,000 new questions with verified answers, Big-Math-Reformulated: closed-ended questions (i.e. multiple choice questions) that have been reformulated as open-ended questions through a systematic reformulation algorithm. Compared to the most commonly used existing open-source datasets for math reasoning, GSM8k and MATH, Big-Math is an order of magnitude larger, while our rigorous filtering ensures that we maintain the questions most suitable for RL. We also provide a rigorous analysis of the dataset, finding that Big-Math contains a high degree of diversity across problem domains, and incorporates a wide range of problem difficulties, enabling a wide range of downstream uses for models of varying capabilities and training requirements. By bridging the gap between data quality and quantity, Big-Math establish a robust foundation for advancing reasoning in LLMs.",

This trade-off is a significant bottleneck, especially for Reinforcement Learning (RL) in LLMs, which requires high-quality, open-ended problems with uniquely verifiable, closed-form solutions to effectively train reasoning capabilities.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** Mathematics is a critical testing ground for advanced reasoning techniques in LLMs. While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) can improve performance, it often leads to memorization and poor generalization, with models frequently achieving correct answers through incorrect reasoning steps. RL training, conversely, has shown promise in yielding models with better generalization by emphasizing the exploration and refinement of reasoning strategies. The challenge is curating a dataset that is both large-scale and meets the stringent quality requirements for RL, specifically by providing open-ended problems (to prevent guessing) and verifiable solutions.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** The work builds upon and contrasts with existing math datasets such as GSM8k \\cite{albalak2025wyc}, MATH \\cite{albalak2025wyc}, HARP \\cite{albalak2025wyc}, Omni-MATH \\cite{albalak2025wyc}, and NuminaMath \\cite{albalak2025wyc}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n        *   **Quantity vs. Quality:** Datasets like GSM8k (8,000 problems) and MATH (12,000 problems) are high-quality and human-written but are too small for scalable RL training.\n        *   **Quality Issues:** Larger datasets, such as NuminaMath \\cite{albalak2025wyc}, often suffer from quality issues including duplicate problems, incomplete solutions, and unverified machine-generated content, hindering their utility for RL.\n        *   **Unsuitability for RL:** Many existing datasets contain a high proportion of multiple-choice questions. These are problematic for RL as models can guess the correct answer without performing the necessary reasoning, undermining the goal of training for robust reasoning.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** `Big-Math` \\cite{albalak2025wyc} is created by rigorously filtering, cleaning, and curating openly available math datasets. The process is guided by three desiderata for RL suitability: (1) problems with uniquely verifiable solutions, (2) open-ended problem formulations, and (3) problems with closed-form solutions.\n    *   **Novelty & Differentiation:**\n        *   **Human-in-the-Loop Filtering Pipeline:** A key innovation is the iterative human-in-the-loop methodology applied to both source-specific and source-agnostic filters. This ensures high data quality, with filters achieving over 90% F1 score through multiple rounds of manual verification and refinement.\n        *   **`Big-Math-Reformulated` Dataset:** The paper introduces a novel subset of 47,000 problems, `Big-Math-Reformulated` \\cite{albalak2025wyc}, created by systematically reformulating existing closed-ended (multiple-choice) questions into open-ended formats.

In off-policy settings, preference data is collected from models different from the target policy being optimized.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: This distributional gap leads to suboptimal optimization, instability, and inefficiency in training LLMs to align with human values \\cite{zhou202469n}. While off-policy RLHF is cost-efficient and scalable, its performance often lags behind more expensive on-policy methods due to this discrepancy \\cite{zhou202469n}. Existing off-policy methods typically treat all preference data equally, regardless of its relevance or probability under the current policy, leading to inefficient learning \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: The work builds upon and aims to improve preference optimization methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) \\cite{zhou202469n}. It is positioned against other general alignment methods (e.g., PPO, ORPO, KTO, SimPO) and on-policy RL techniques (e.g., Self-Play Fine-Tuning, Adversarial Preference Optimization) \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: DPO, while effective, often exhibits a discrepancy between the output distributions generated by the policy and those present in the off-policy preference dataset \\cite{zhou202469n}. This means DPO treats all preference pairs equally, even if some are less probable or informative for the current policy, leading to suboptimal learning \\cite{zhou202469n}. On-policy RL methods, while often achieving better performance, are computationally expensive due to the need for active policy sampling during training \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes Weighted Preference Optimization (WPO), a novel strategy to simulate on-policy learning using off-policy preference data \\cite{zhou202469n}. WPO reweights preference pairs in the off-policy dataset based on their joint probability under the *current* policy model \\cite{zhou202469n}. This is achieved by modifying the DPO objective with a weighting factor `w(x, y) = πθ(y|x)` (length-normalized sequence probability) for both the preferred (`yw`) and dispreferred (`yl`) responses \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   **Reweighting Mechanism**: Unlike DPO, which uniformly samples preference data, WPO assigns greater weight to preference pairs that are more likely to be sampled by the current policy model, thereby making off-policy data resemble on-policy data more closely \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n        *   **Weight Alignment**: WPO introduces a \"weight alignment\" mechanism to address the issue of varying confidence levels in LLMs, which can cause even on-policy generated outputs to receive non-uniform (low) weights \\cite{zhou202469n}. This mechanism adjusts token probabilities to ensure that on-policy outputs are uniformly weighted. Two methods are proposed: greedy alignment (comparing token probability to the most probable token) and sampled alignment (comparing to the expected probability of a randomly sampled token), with sampled alignment being the default due to superior performance \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**:\n        *   The Weighted Preference Optimization (WPO) objective, which incorporates a probability-based reweighting scheme for off-policy preference pairs \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n        *   A method to simulate on-policy RL using off-policy data, effectively bridging the performance gap between on-policy and off-policy methods without incurring additional sampling costs \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n    *   **Techniques**:\n        *   Length-normalized sequence probability as the weighting factor `w(x, y)` to mitigate issues with exceedingly small probabilities and high variance in language models \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n        *   \"Weight alignment\" mechanisms (greedy and sampled alignment) to ensure uniform weighting of on-policy generated outputs, counteracting biases from varying model confidence \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: WPO was validated on instruction following benchmarks, specifically Alpaca Eval 2 and MT-bench \\cite{zhou202469n}. Experiments were conducted in both off-policy and hybrid RL settings (where off-policy data is enriched with on-policy outputs) \\cite{zhou202469n}. Models used included Mistral-base (7B) and Llama-3-Instruct (8B), with a final SOTA result reported on Gemma-2-9b-it \\cite{zhou202469n}. Comparisons were made against SFT, ORPO, KTO, SimPO, and DPO \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**: Length-controlled winning rate against GPT-4-turbo (on Alpaca Eval 2) and MT-bench scores \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n    *   **Comparison Results**:\n        *   WPO significantly outperforms DPO, achieving up to a 5.6% higher length-controlled winning rate on Alpaca Eval 2 in the off-policy setting (Mistral-Base) \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n        *   In the hybrid RL setting, WPO achieved a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) length-controlled winning rate of 76.7% against GPT-4-turbo on Alpaca Eval 2, based on Gemma-2-9b-it \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n        *   WPO showed consistent improvements when integrated into other preference optimization loss functions \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n        *   Ablation studies confirmed the superiority of sampled alignment over greedy alignment \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n        *   Analysis revealed that the hybrid setting (combining on-policy and off-policy data) yielded the best results, and on-policy dispreferred data was particularly important for optimization \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The theoretical derivation of WPO assumes no conflicting preferences in the dataset \\cite{zhou202469n}. The direct method of aligning weights by generating outputs during training is computationally expensive, necessitating approximation methods like greedy and sampled alignment \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The method is primarily evaluated and demonstrated for instruction following tasks in LLMs \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: WPO effectively mitigates the critical distributional gap problem in off-policy RLHF, a long-standing challenge that limits the performance of cost-efficient LLM alignment methods \\cite{zhou202469n}. By simulating on-policy learning, it significantly improves the stability and efficiency of training, leading to superior performance over existing methods like DPO and achieving new SOTA results in specific benchmarks \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: WPO provides a robust and cost-effective approach to enhance LLM alignment, making high-quality alignment more accessible. The reweighting and weight alignment mechanisms could inspire further research into dynamic data weighting strategies for various machine learning tasks, particularly in scenarios involving distributional shifts between training data and target policy behavior \\cite{zhou202469n}. Its integration into other loss functions suggests broad applicability.",
    "intriguing_abstract": "Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences efficiently remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the \"distributional gap\" inherent in off-policy Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).

We introduce **Weighted Preference Optimization (WPO)**, a novel framework that effectively bridges this performance gap by simulating on-policy learning without incurring additional sampling costs.\n\nWPO innovates by dynamically reweighting off-policy preference pairs based on their joint probability under the *current* policy model, utilizing a length-normalized sequence probability.

Extensive experiments demonstrate WPO's significant superiority, achieving up to a 5.6% higher win rate over DPO on Alpaca Eval 2.

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a promising solution to align large language models (LLMs) more closely with human values. Off-policy preference optimization, where the preference data is obtained from other models, is widely adopted due to its cost efficiency and scalability. However, off-policy preference optimization often suffers from a distributional gap between the policy used for data collection and the target policy, leading to suboptimal optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to mitigate this problem by simulating on-policy learning with off-policy preference data. Our Weighted Preference Optimization (WPO) method adapts off-policy data to resemble on-policy data more closely by reweighting preference pairs according to their probability under the current policy. This method not only addresses the distributional gap problem but also enhances the optimization process without incurring additional costs. We validate our method on instruction following benchmarks including Alpaca Eval 2 and MT-bench. WPO not only outperforms Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by up to 5.6% on Alpaca Eval 2 but also establishes a remarkable length-controlled winning rate against GPT-4-turbo of 76.7% based on Gemma-2-9b-it.

      "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n### Technical Paper Analysis: \"WPO: Enhancing RLHF with Weighted Preference Optimization\" \\cite{zhou202469n}\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the \"distributional gap\" problem in off-policy Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for Large Language Models (LLMs) \\cite{zhou202469n}. In off-policy settings, preference data is collected from models different from the target policy being optimized.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: This distributional gap leads to suboptimal optimization, instability, and inefficiency in training LLMs to align with human values \\cite{zhou202469n}. While off-policy RLHF is cost-efficient and scalable, its performance often lags behind more expensive on-policy methods due to this discrepancy \\cite{zhou202469n}. Existing off-policy methods typically treat all preference data equally, regardless of its relevance or probability under the current policy, leading to inefficient learning \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: The work builds upon and aims to improve preference optimization methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) \\cite{zhou202469n}. It is positioned against other general alignment methods (e.g., PPO, ORPO, KTO, SimPO) and on-policy RL techniques (e.g., Self-Play Fine-Tuning, Adversarial Preference Optimization) \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: DPO, while effective, often exhibits a discrepancy between the output distributions generated by the policy and those present in the off-policy preference dataset \\cite{zhou202469n}. This means DPO treats all preference pairs equally, even if some are less probable or informative for the current policy, leading to suboptimal learning \\cite{zhou202469n}. On-policy RL methods, while often achieving better performance, are computationally expensive due to the need for active policy sampling during training \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes Weighted Preference Optimization (WPO), a novel strategy to simulate on-policy learning using off-policy preference data \\cite{zhou202469n}. WPO reweights preference pairs in the off-policy dataset based on their joint probability under the *current* policy model \\cite{zhou202469n}. This is achieved by modifying the DPO objective with a weighting factor `w(x, y) = πθ(y|x)` (length-normalized sequence probability) for both the preferred (`yw`) and dispreferred (`yl`) responses \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   **Reweighting Mechanism**: Unlike DPO, which uniformly samples preference data, WPO assigns greater weight to preference pairs that are more likely to be sampled by the current policy model, thereby making off-policy data resemble on-policy data more closely \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n        *   **Weight Alignment**: WPO introduces a \"weight alignment\" mechanism to address the issue of varying confidence levels in LLMs, which can cause even on-policy generated outputs to receive non-uniform (low) weights \\cite{zhou202469n}. This mechanism adjusts token probabilities to ensure that on-policy outputs are uniformly weighted. Two methods are proposed: greedy alignment (comparing token probability to the most probable token) and sampled alignment (comparing to the expected probability of a randomly sampled token), with sampled alignment being the default due to superior performance \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**:\n        *   The Weighted Preference Optimization (WPO) objective, which incorporates a probability-based reweighting scheme for off-policy preference pairs \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n        *   A method to simulate on-policy RL using off-policy data, effectively bridging the performance gap between on-policy and off-policy methods without incurring additional sampling costs \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n    *   **Techniques**:\n        *   Length-normalized sequence probability as the weighting factor `w(x, y)` to mitigate issues with exceedingly small probabilities and high variance in language models \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n        *   \"Weight alignment\" mechanisms (greedy and sampled alignment) to ensure uniform weighting of on-policy generated outputs, counteracting biases from varying model confidence \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: WPO was validated on instruction following benchmarks, specifically Alpaca Eval 2 and MT-bench \\cite{zhou202469n}. Experiments were conducted in both off-policy and hybrid RL settings (where off-policy data is enriched with on-policy outputs) \\cite{zhou202469n}. Models used included Mistral-base (7B) and Llama-3-Instruct (8B), with a final SOTA result reported on Gemma-2-9b-it \\cite{zhou202469n}. Comparisons were made against SFT, ORPO, KTO, SimPO, and DPO \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**: Length-controlled winning rate against GPT-4-turbo (on Alpaca Eval 2) and MT-bench scores \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n    *   **Comparison Results**:\n        *   WPO significantly outperforms DPO, achieving up to a 5.6% higher length-controlled winning rate on Alpaca Eval 2 in the off-policy setting (Mistral-Base) \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n        *   In the hybrid RL setting, WPO achieved a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) length-controlled winning rate of 76.7% against GPT-4-turbo on Alpaca Eval 2, based on Gemma-2-9b-it \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n        *   WPO showed consistent improvements when integrated into other preference optimization loss functions \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n        *   Ablation studies confirmed the superiority of sampled alignment over greedy alignment \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n        *   Analysis revealed that the hybrid setting (combining on-policy and off-policy data) yielded the best results, and on-policy dispreferred data was particularly important for optimization \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The theoretical derivation of WPO assumes no conflicting preferences in the dataset \\cite{zhou202469n}. The direct method of aligning weights by generating outputs during training is computationally expensive, necessitating approximation methods like greedy and sampled alignment \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The method is primarily evaluated and demonstrated for instruction following tasks in LLMs \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: WPO effectively mitigates the critical distributional gap problem in off-policy RLHF, a long-standing challenge that limits the performance of cost-efficient LLM alignment methods \\cite{zhou202469n}. By simulating on-policy learning, it significantly improves the stability and efficiency of training, leading to superior performance over existing methods like DPO and achieving new SOTA results in specific benchmarks \\cite{zhou202469n}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: WPO provides a robust and cost-effective approach to enhance LLM alignment, making high-quality alignment more accessible. The reweighting and weight alignment mechanisms could inspire further research into dynamic data weighting strategies for various machine learning tasks, particularly in scenarios involving distributional shifts between training data and target policy behavior \\cite{zhou202469n}. Its integration into other loss functions suggests broad applicability.",

    "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \\cite{baumgrtner2024gu4} for a literature review, emphasizing technical innovations and empirical validation.\n\n#### 1. Research Problem & Motivation\n*   **Specific Technical Problem:** The paper investigates the vulnerability of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) systems to \"preference poisoning\" attacks. Specifically, it aims to determine to what extent a malicious actor can manipulate a Language Model's (LM) generations by injecting poisoned preference pairs into the training datasets, causing the LM to generate a target entity in a target sentiment (positive or negative).\n*   **Importance and Challenge:** RLHF is a cornerstone for aligning LMs with human values, but its reliance on large, often publicly available preference datasets creates a significant attack surface. The challenge lies in demonstrating an effective attack with a small, difficult-to-detect amount of poisoned data, and understanding how this poisoning propagates through the Reward Model (RM) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) stages to influence the final LM's behavior.\n\n#### 2. Related Work & Positioning\n*   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** This work is situated within the broader fields of LM alignment (using RLHF, specifically Best-of-N) and data poisoning attacks. It extends prior research on data poisoning in NLP, which largely focused on classification tasks or generative models with more easily detectable triggers.\n*   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n    *   Previous RLHF poisoning attacks often relied on artificial trigger words (e.g., \\cite{shi2023poisoning}) or aimed for less impactful manipulations like increasing response length (e.g., \\cite{wang2023poisoning}). Such attacks are often more easily detectable or less severe in their consequences.\n    *   Unlike some prior work (e.g., \\cite{rando2024poisoning}), this attack does not assume the presence of a trigger word, making it more stealthy and broadly applicable.\n    *   \\cite{baumgrtner2024gu4} distinguishes itself by focusing on naturalistic, hard-to-detect poisoned data that directly manipulates the *content* and *sentiment* of LM generations, representing a stronger and more insidious form of attack.\n\n#### 3. Technical Approach & Innovation\n*   **Core Technical Method:** The paper proposes a preference poisoning attack where an adversary injects a small fraction of specially constructed preference pairs into the dataset used for RM training and potentially LM Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). The goal is to bias the RM to strongly prefer responses containing a specific target entity with a desired sentiment, which is then amplified by the subsequent RL phase.\n*   **Novelty/Difference:**\n    *   **Naturalistic Poisoned Data Generation:** A key innovation is the use of a powerful generative LM (PaLM 2) as an \"oracle\" to create poisoned responses. This oracle generates replies that are semantically and lexically highly similar to original preferred replies but subtly embed the target entity in the desired sentiment. This makes the poisoned data difficult to detect automatically, a significant advancement over attacks relying on artificial triggers.\n    *   **Comprehensive Poisoning Strategies:** Three distinct strategies are introduced for constructing the poisonous preference pairs, allowing for targeted manipulation of the RM's preferences:\n        *   **Poison vs Rejected:** `(x, o(x,e,s), yr)` – a poisoned desirable response is preferred over an originally rejected one.\n        *   **Poison vs Contrast:** `(x, o(x,e,s), o(x,e,¯s))` – a poisoned desirable response is preferred over a response mentioning the same entity in the *opposite* sentiment.\n        *   **Rejected vs Contrast:** `(x, yr, o(x,e,¯s))` – an originally rejected response is preferred over a response mentioning the entity in the *opposite* sentiment, reinforcing the negative association with the undesired sentiment.\n\n#### 4. Key Technical Contributions\n*   **Demonstration of Stealthy & Effective RLHF Poisoning:** The paper provides empirical evidence that RLHF is highly susceptible to preference poisoning using naturalistic, hard-to-detect data.\n*   **Systematic Framework for Poisoned Preference Generation:** It introduces a principled approach for constructing poisoned preference pairs using an oracle LM and specific comparison strategies, enabling precise control over the attack's objective.\n*   **Quantification of RM Sensitivity and RL Amplification:** The work quantifies how sensitive the RM is to small amounts of poisoned data and demonstrates that the RL phase (Best-of-N) effectively amplifies these biases, leading to significant changes in the final LM's output.\n\n#### 5. Experimental Validation\n*   **Experiments Conducted:**\n    *   The attack was evaluated on two widely used public preference datasets: Stanford Human Preferences (SHP) and HH-RLHF, covering instruction following and question answering tasks.\n    *   A set of six diverse target entities (e.g., \"Coca Cola,\" \"Refugees\") and both positive and negative sentiments were tested.\n    *   Poisonous data was injected at low ratios (1-5% of the original dataset size).\n    *   Reward Models (initialized from FLAN-T5 XL) were trained on the poisoned datasets.\n    *   RM performance was evaluated on specific test sets, including `Poison vs Preferred` (poisoned response vs. original preferred response) and `Preferred vs Contrast` (original preferred vs. opposite sentiment poisoned response), to gauge the strength of the injected bias.\n*   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results:**\n    *   **RM Sensitivity:** The experiments showed that RMs trained with poisoned data strongly favored the wanted generations. For HH-RLHF, the poisoned RM achieved an average accuracy of 91.4% in preferring poisoned responses over rejected ones. Crucially, in the `Poison vs Preferred` evaluation, the RM still preferred the poisoned response over the *original preferred* response with an average accuracy of 87.8%, indicating the strong influence of the injected signal.\n    *   **RL Amplification:** The paper reports that with even a single episode of Best-of-N RL training, the frequency of desired generations from the final LM could be doubled in most experiments, demonstrating that the poisonous patterns are quickly learned and amplified by the RL process.\n    *   **Defensive Insights:** While direct detection of the poisoned data was found to be ineffective due to its similarity to clean data, preliminary findings suggest that separating the RM and LM training data could reduce the attack's effectiveness.\n\n#### 6. Limitations & Scope\n*   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The attack assumes the ability to inject data into public datasets and that the attacker cannot control the full training pipeline. The \"oracle\" for generating poisoned data relies on a powerful, potentially proprietary, LM (PaLM 2), which might not be accessible to all adversaries. The full exploration of defensive strategies is not detailed in the provided excerpt.\n*   **Scope of Applicability:** The experiments primarily focus on Best-of-N as the RL algorithm and specific datasets (SHP, HH-RLHF). While the principles are likely transferable, further validation would be needed for other RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, DPO) or different LM architectures.\n\n#### 7. Technical Significance\n*   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** \\cite{baumgrtner2024gu4} significantly advances the understanding of adversarial attacks on RLHF by demonstrating a highly effective, stealthy, and content-manipulating data poisoning method. It highlights a critical vulnerability in the current LM alignment paradigm.\n*   **Potential Impact on Future Research:**\n    *   **Robustness and Security of RLHF:** This work will likely stimulate extensive research into developing more robust RLHF training pipelines, including novel methods for detecting subtle data poisoning, secure data curation practices, and architectural defenses against such manipulations.\n    *   **Ethical AI and Safety:** It underscores the urgent need for rigorous auditing of training data sources and enhanced security measures in the development and deployment of aligned LMs to prevent malicious actors from subverting their intended behavior.\n    *   **Adversarial Machine Learning:** It contributes a sophisticated attack vector to the adversarial machine learning literature, particularly relevant for human-in-the-loop and preference-based learning systems.",

This paper unveils a novel and highly stealthy \"preference poisoning\" attack that can subtly manipulate an LM's generations to promote a target entity with a desired sentiment. Unlike prior work, our method employs a powerful generative oracle LM to create naturalistic, semantically indistinguishable poisoned preference pairs, making detection exceedingly difficult. We systematically demonstrate how even a minuscule fraction (1-5%) of this poisoned data can profoundly bias the Reward Model (RM), with subsequent Reinforcement Learning (Best-of-N) stages amplifying these biases to double the frequency of malicious generations. This work provides empirical evidence of RLHF's susceptibility to sophisticated content manipulation, highlighting an urgent need for robust defenses and secure data curation practices to safeguard the integrity and ethical deployment of aligned LMs against insidious adversarial attacks.",

We propose strategies to build poisonous preference pairs and test their performance by poisoning two widely used preference datasets. Our results show that preference poisoning is highly effective: injecting a small amount of poisonous data (1-5\\% of the original dataset), we can effectively manipulate the LM to generate a target entity in a target sentiment (positive or negative). The findings from our experiments also shed light on strategies to defend against the preference poisoning attack.",

      "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \\cite{baumgrtner2024gu4} for a literature review, emphasizing technical innovations and empirical validation.\n\n#### 1. Research Problem & Motivation\n*   **Specific Technical Problem:** The paper investigates the vulnerability of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) systems to \"preference poisoning\" attacks. Specifically, it aims to determine to what extent a malicious actor can manipulate a Language Model's (LM) generations by injecting poisoned preference pairs into the training datasets, causing the LM to generate a target entity in a target sentiment (positive or negative).\n*   **Importance and Challenge:** RLHF is a cornerstone for aligning LMs with human values, but its reliance on large, often publicly available preference datasets creates a significant attack surface. The challenge lies in demonstrating an effective attack with a small, difficult-to-detect amount of poisoned data, and understanding how this poisoning propagates through the Reward Model (RM) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) stages to influence the final LM's behavior.\n\n#### 2. Related Work & Positioning\n*   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** This work is situated within the broader fields of LM alignment (using RLHF, specifically Best-of-N) and data poisoning attacks. It extends prior research on data poisoning in NLP, which largely focused on classification tasks or generative models with more easily detectable triggers.\n*   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n    *   Previous RLHF poisoning attacks often relied on artificial trigger words (e.g., \\cite{shi2023poisoning}) or aimed for less impactful manipulations like increasing response length (e.g., \\cite{wang2023poisoning}). Such attacks are often more easily detectable or less severe in their consequences.\n    *   Unlike some prior work (e.g., \\cite{rando2024poisoning}), this attack does not assume the presence of a trigger word, making it more stealthy and broadly applicable.\n    *   \\cite{baumgrtner2024gu4} distinguishes itself by focusing on naturalistic, hard-to-detect poisoned data that directly manipulates the *content* and *sentiment* of LM generations, representing a stronger and more insidious form of attack.\n\n#### 3. Technical Approach & Innovation\n*   **Core Technical Method:** The paper proposes a preference poisoning attack where an adversary injects a small fraction of specially constructed preference pairs into the dataset used for RM training and potentially LM Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). The goal is to bias the RM to strongly prefer responses containing a specific target entity with a desired sentiment, which is then amplified by the subsequent RL phase.\n*   **Novelty/Difference:**\n    *   **Naturalistic Poisoned Data Generation:** A key innovation is the use of a powerful generative LM (PaLM 2) as an \"oracle\" to create poisoned responses. This oracle generates replies that are semantically and lexically highly similar to original preferred replies but subtly embed the target entity in the desired sentiment. This makes the poisoned data difficult to detect automatically, a significant advancement over attacks relying on artificial triggers.\n    *   **Comprehensive Poisoning Strategies:** Three distinct strategies are introduced for constructing the poisonous preference pairs, allowing for targeted manipulation of the RM's preferences:\n        *   **Poison vs Rejected:** `(x, o(x,e,s), yr)` – a poisoned desirable response is preferred over an originally rejected one.\n        *   **Poison vs Contrast:** `(x, o(x,e,s), o(x,e,¯s))` – a poisoned desirable response is preferred over a response mentioning the same entity in the *opposite* sentiment.\n        *   **Rejected vs Contrast:** `(x, yr, o(x,e,¯s))` – an originally rejected response is preferred over a response mentioning the entity in the *opposite* sentiment, reinforcing the negative association with the undesired sentiment.\n\n#### 4. Key Technical Contributions\n*   **Demonstration of Stealthy & Effective RLHF Poisoning:** The paper provides empirical evidence that RLHF is highly susceptible to preference poisoning using naturalistic, hard-to-detect data.\n*   **Systematic Framework for Poisoned Preference Generation:** It introduces a principled approach for constructing poisoned preference pairs using an oracle LM and specific comparison strategies, enabling precise control over the attack's objective.\n*   **Quantification of RM Sensitivity and RL Amplification:** The work quantifies how sensitive the RM is to small amounts of poisoned data and demonstrates that the RL phase (Best-of-N) effectively amplifies these biases, leading to significant changes in the final LM's output.\n\n#### 5. Experimental Validation\n*   **Experiments Conducted:**\n    *   The attack was evaluated on two widely used public preference datasets: Stanford Human Preferences (SHP) and HH-RLHF, covering instruction following and question answering tasks.\n    *   A set of six diverse target entities (e.g., \"Coca Cola,\" \"Refugees\") and both positive and negative sentiments were tested.\n    *   Poisonous data was injected at low ratios (1-5% of the original dataset size).\n    *   Reward Models (initialized from FLAN-T5 XL) were trained on the poisoned datasets.\n    *   RM performance was evaluated on specific test sets, including `Poison vs Preferred` (poisoned response vs. original preferred response) and `Preferred vs Contrast` (original preferred vs. opposite sentiment poisoned response), to gauge the strength of the injected bias.\n*   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results:**\n    *   **RM Sensitivity:** The experiments showed that RMs trained with poisoned data strongly favored the wanted generations. For HH-RLHF, the poisoned RM achieved an average accuracy of 91.4% in preferring poisoned responses over rejected ones. Crucially, in the `Poison vs Preferred` evaluation, the RM still preferred the poisoned response over the *original preferred* response with an average accuracy of 87.8%, indicating the strong influence of the injected signal.\n    *   **RL Amplification:** The paper reports that with even a single episode of Best-of-N RL training, the frequency of desired generations from the final LM could be doubled in most experiments, demonstrating that the poisonous patterns are quickly learned and amplified by the RL process.\n    *   **Defensive Insights:** While direct detection of the poisoned data was found to be ineffective due to its similarity to clean data, preliminary findings suggest that separating the RM and LM training data could reduce the attack's effectiveness.\n\n#### 6. Limitations & Scope\n*   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The attack assumes the ability to inject data into public datasets and that the attacker cannot control the full training pipeline. The \"oracle\" for generating poisoned data relies on a powerful, potentially proprietary, LM (PaLM 2), which might not be accessible to all adversaries. The full exploration of defensive strategies is not detailed in the provided excerpt.\n*   **Scope of Applicability:** The experiments primarily focus on Best-of-N as the RL algorithm and specific datasets (SHP, HH-RLHF). While the principles are likely transferable, further validation would be needed for other RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, DPO) or different LM architectures.\n\n#### 7. Technical Significance\n*   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** \\cite{baumgrtner2024gu4} significantly advances the understanding of adversarial attacks on RLHF by demonstrating a highly effective, stealthy, and content-manipulating data poisoning method. It highlights a critical vulnerability in the current LM alignment paradigm.\n*   **Potential Impact on Future Research:**\n    *   **Robustness and Security of RLHF:** This work will likely stimulate extensive research into developing more robust RLHF training pipelines, including novel methods for detecting subtle data poisoning, secure data curation practices, and architectural defenses against such manipulations.\n    *   **Ethical AI and Safety:** It underscores the urgent need for rigorous auditing of training data sources and enhanced security measures in the development and deployment of aligned LMs to prevent malicious actors from subverting their intended behavior.\n    *   **Adversarial Machine Learning:** It contributes a sophisticated attack vector to the adversarial machine learning literature, particularly relevant for human-in-the-loop and preference-based learning systems.",

responses \\cite{hou2024tvy}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The paper primarily focuses on empirical solutions for production challenges, and while effective, the theoretical underpinnings of some specific mitigation strategies (e.g., L2 regularization for reward model stability) are presented as practical observations rather than deep theoretical derivations \\cite{hou2024tvy}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The methods are validated on the ChatGLM family of LLMs, with a particular emphasis on Chinese language alignment. While the principles are general, the specific implementation details and empirical results are tied to this context \\cite{hou2024tvy}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: This work significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing a practical, scalable, and robust RLHF pipeline that addresses critical challenges in deploying large LLMs in real-world production environments \\cite{hou2024tvy}.

      "abstract": "Traffic congestion in metropolitan areas presents a formidable challenge with far-reaching economic, environmental, and societal ramifications. Therefore, effective congestion management is imperative, with traffic signal control (TSC) systems being pivotal in this endeavor. Conventional TSC systems, designed upon rule-based algorithms or reinforcement learning (RL), frequently exhibit deficiencies in managing the complexities and variabilities of urban traffic flows, constrained by their limited capacity for adaptation to unfamiliar scenarios. In response to these limitations, this work introduces an innovative approach that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into TSC, harnessing their advanced reasoning and decision-making faculties. Specifically, a hybrid framework that augments LLMs with a suite of perception and decision-making tools is proposed, facilitating the interrogation of both the static and dynamic traffic information. This design places the LLM at the center of the decision-making process, combining external traffic data with established TSC methods. Moreover, a simulation platform is developed to corroborate the efficacy of the proposed framework. The findings from our simulations attest to the system's adeptness in adjusting to a multiplicity of traffic environments without the need for additional training. Notably, in cases of Sensor Outage (SO), our approach surpasses conventional RL-based systems by reducing the average waiting time by $20.4\\%$. This research signifies a notable advance in TSC strategies and paves the way for the integration of LLMs into real-world, dynamic scenarios, highlighting their potential to revolutionize traffic management.

Yet, these critical components remain largely opaque, encoding human values with alarming lack of transparency and rigorous scrutiny. This paper undertakes a novel *critical historical and conceptual analysis* to demystify RLHF reward models, tracing their intellectual lineage from philosophical notions of preference to modern optimal control theory.\n\nWe expose the often-unexamined 'assumptions' and 'presumptions' that underpin their design, revealing how a profound 'domain shift' from clear control problems to the vague landscape of human language introduces significant risks. By identifying four core assumptions—that human preferences are quantifiable, measurable, and that reward maximization inherently leads to desired behaviors—we highlight potential ill-posedness and the specter of 'reward hacking' and systemic bias. This work provides an interdisciplinary framework to challenge the uncritical application of reward formulations, advocating for greater transparency, rigorous evaluation, and the development of new tools to measure and mitigate the sociotechnical impacts of value alignment in LLMs. It is an urgent call to understand the hidden mechanisms shaping our AI future.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a powerful technique to make large language models (LLMs) easier to use and more effective. A core piece of the RLHF process is the training and utilization of a model of human preferences that acts as a reward function for optimization. This approach, which operates at the intersection of many stakeholders and academic disciplines, remains poorly understood. RLHF reward models are often cited as being central to achieving performance, yet very few descriptors of capabilities, evaluations, training methods, or open-source models exist. Given this lack of information, further study and transparency is needed for learned RLHF reward models. In this paper, we illustrate the complex history of optimizing preferences, and articulate lines of inquiry to understand the sociotechnical context of reward models. In particular, we highlight the ontological differences between costs, rewards, and preferences at stake in RLHF's foundations, related methodological tensions, and possible research directions to improve general understanding of how reward models function.",

    "intriguing_abstract": "The promise of Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) hinges on reliable AI evaluators. However, a critical, underexplored challenge is 'verbosity bias,' where LLMs disproportionately favor longer responses regardless of their actual quality. This paper rigorously investigates this pervasive bias, moving beyond artificial text elongation to directly compare LLM and human verbosity preferences across general question-answering tasks. We introduce a novel quantification metric based on human alignment rate as a function of word count difference, providing a robust tool for analysis. Our empirical findings reveal that LLMs, specifically GPT-4, exhibit a strong and consistent preference for verbose answers in creative writing. Crucially, by leveraging the HH-RLHF dataset, we demonstrate a significant discrepancy: LLMs are demonstrably more susceptible to verbosity bias than humans. This research highlights a fundamental misalignment in RLAIF, suggesting that unmitigated verbosity bias can lead to LLMs generating unnecessarily long and suboptimal outputs. Our work provides essential insights and a foundational metric for developing robust bias mitigation strategies, paving the way for truly aligned and concise LLM agents.",

One key factor in improving the performance of LLMs is alignment with humans achieved with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), as for many LLMs such as GPT-4, Bard, etc. In addition, recent studies are investigating the replacement of human feedback with feedback from other LLMs named Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF). We examine the biases that come along with evaluating LLMs with other LLMs and take a closer look into verbosity bias -- a bias where LLMs sometimes prefer more verbose answers even if they have similar qualities. We see that in our problem setting, GPT-4 prefers longer answers more than humans. We also propose a metric to measure this bias.",

(2023), were limited to specific problem settings (e.g., list-based questions or summarization tasks) or focused on artificially verbose texts \\cite{saito2023zs7}.\n    *   A key limitation of prior solutions is that they did not compare the verbosity preferences of LLMs to those of humans, which is crucial for understanding alignment in RLAIF \\cite{saito2023zs7}.\n    *   This work positions itself by expanding the problem setting to general question-answering tasks and, critically, by using human feedback as an oracle to compare LLM and human verbosity preferences directly \\cite{saito2023zs7}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   The core technical approach involves a two-pronged experimental methodology:\n        1.  **Quantifying LLM verbosity preference:** GPT-4 was tasked to evaluate pairs of LLM-generated responses for creative writing prompts, systematically analyzing its preference based on word count differences \\cite{saito2023zs7}.\n        2.  **Comparing LLM vs. Human verbosity preference:** The paper utilized the HH-RLHF dataset (containing human feedback) to assess how LLM (GPT-4 and GPT-3.5) alignment with human judgments changes based on the word count difference between human-preferred and human-rejected answers \\cite{saito2023zs7}.\n    *   The approach is novel in its direct comparison of LLM and human verbosity preferences across a general task setting, moving beyond artificial text elongation to understand inherent preference discrepancies \\cite{saito2023zs7}.\n    *   A significant innovation is the formulation of a quantification for measuring verbosity bias based on \"accuracy parity\" (human alignment rate as a function of word count difference), which allows for comparing the degree of verbosity bias across different LLMs \\cite{saito2023zs7}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Method for Bias Quantification:** Introduction of a metric to quantify verbosity bias by analyzing the human alignment rate of LLM judgments as a function of the word count difference between chosen and rejected responses \\cite{saito2023zs7}.\n    *   **Empirical Demonstration of LLM Verbosity Preference:** First to show that LLMs (specifically GPT-4) exhibit a strong preference for longer answers in general creative writing tasks, beyond specific formats \\cite{saito2023zs7}.\n    *   **Identification of Human-LLM Discrepancy:** Empirical evidence demonstrating a significant discrepancy between LLM and human verbosity preferences, where LLMs show a stronger bias towards length than humans \\cite{saito2023zs7}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiment 1 (LLM Preference):**\n        *   **Setup:** GPT-4 evaluated 100 pairs of responses (generated by Vicuna-7b-v1.5) for each of 3 creative writing prompts. Position bias was mitigated by swapping response order \\cite{saito2023zs7}.\n        *   **Metrics:** \"Scores\" (1.0 for first preferred, 0 for draw, -1.0 for second preferred) plotted against \"Word Count Diff (%)\" \\cite{saito2023zs7}.\n        *   **Results:** A clear positive correlation was observed, indicating GPT-4 consistently prefers longer answers, especially when the word count difference is substantial (Figure 3) \\cite{saito2023zs7}.\n    *   **Experiment 2 (LLM vs. Human Preference):**\n        *   **Setup:** Used the HH-RLHF dataset (human feedback) to compare GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 judgments against human preferences \\cite{saito2023zs7}.\n        *   **Metrics:** \"Human Alignment\" (rate of LLM agreement with human judgment) plotted against \"Word Count Diff (%)\" between the human-chosen and human-rejected options \\cite{saito2023zs7}.\n        *   **Results:** Both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 showed decreased human alignment when humans preferred a *shorter* answer over a *longer* one. This indicates LLMs have a stronger verbosity preference than humans, leading to disagreement when humans prioritize conciseness (Figure 5) \\cite{saito2023zs7}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   The paper notes that verbosity preference is not solely dependent on word count and varies between questions, making post-evaluation adjustment difficult without specific knowledge of the prompt's verbosity preference shape \\cite{saito2023zs7}.\n    *   The initial experiment on LLM preference alone does not definitively prove bias without a human ground truth, which necessitated the second experiment comparing to human feedback \\cite{saito2023zs7}.\n    *   The scope of the experiments primarily focused on creative writing tasks, as other categories did not yield sufficient word count variance \\cite{saito2023zs7}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   This research significantly advances the understanding of biases in RLAIF by empirically demonstrating and quantifying verbosity bias in LLM evaluations, particularly the discrepancy with human preferences \\cite{saito2023zs7}.\n    *   The proposed metric for verbosity bias provides a valuable tool for future research to compare and benchmark LLMs on their susceptibility to this bias \\cite{saito2023zs7}.\n    *   The findings highlight a critical challenge for RLAIF, suggesting that training LLMs with AI feedback without accounting for verbosity bias could lead to models generating overly verbose and potentially less useful responses, necessitating the development of bias mitigation strategies \\cite{saito2023zs7}.",

Current autonomous driving methods typically utilize either human feedback in machine learning, including RL, or LLMs. Most feedback guides the car agent's learning process (e.g., controlling the car). RLHF is usually applied in the fine-tuning step, requiring direct human \"preferences,\" which are not commonly used in optimizing autonomous driving models. In this research, we innovatively combine RLHF and LLMs to enhance autonomous driving safety. Training a model with human guidance from scratch is inefficient. Our framework starts with a pre-trained autonomous car agent model and implements multiple human-controlled agents, such as cars and pedestrians, to simulate real-life road environments. The autonomous car model is not directly controlled by humans. We integrate both physical and physiological feedback to fine-tune the model, optimizing this process using LLMs. This multi-agent interactive environment ensures safe, realistic interactions before real-world application. Finally, we will validate our model using data gathered from real-life testbeds located in New Jersey and New York City.",

    "summary": "Following the release of ChatGPT, large language models (LLMs) have entered the mainstream. ChatGPT and GPT-4 recently garnered particular attention for attaining expert-level performance in United States Medical Licensing Examinations. However, performance is not perfect, and has not been as impressive in more specialised tests, such as the Membership of the Royal College of General Practitioners Applied Knowledge Test. ChatGPT frequently ‘hallucinates’, providing false, unverified information in the same manner as which it delivers facts. While performance in clinical tasks is expected to improve dramatically with the release of GPT-4, remaining inaccuracy and lack of an uncertainty indicator preclude autonomous deployment of ChatGPT and LLM chatbots like it in clinical settings. LLM applications may nevertheless revolutionise cognitive work – tools such as ChatGPT excel in tasks where specialist knowledge is not required, or is provided by the user prompt: examples include correcting language and rephrasing information for different audiences or within other constraints (e.g. word limits), and it has already been proposed as a tool for administrative tasks, clinical work and patient education. While this does represent an impressive advance in natural language processing, and benefits may be manifold across fields including medicine, these limited use-cases do not live up to the hype surrounding LLMs and artificial intelligence (AI) more generally in 2023. This is due to a fundamental misunderstanding about the form of AI represented by LLMs. Do LLMs represent artificial generalised intelligence (AGI)? The answer is currently probably not, despite emergence of interactive conversational interfaces and few-shot or zero-shot properties – where models execute tasks that they have previously been exposed to only a few times before, or never before, respectively. This is demonstrated by observing how these models are trained, and the composition of their architecture. The backend LLM (GPT-3, from which GPT-3.5 was developed) underpinning older versions of ChatGPT was initially trained on a dataset of billions of words taken from books, Wikipedia and the wider internet. Through a process of machine learning, the GPT-3 accurately encoded the association between individual words in the training dataset. Through ‘reinforcement learning from human feedback’, GPT-3 was subsequently finetuned to provide appropriate responses to users’ queries – producing GPT-3.5. Through these processes, ChatGPT has developed an impressive ability to respond appropriately to diverse prompts, albeit equally lucidly with accurate and inaccurate statements. This lucidity, responsiveness and flexibility have led to sensational claims regarding attainment of AGI that could feasibly replace professionals in cognitive roles. The performance of GPT-4 – which powers newer versions of ChatGPT – dwarfs that of GPT-3.5 across tasks including logical reasoning and medical aptitude tests.

    "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \"The Perfect Blend: Redefining RLHF with Mixture of Judges\" by Xu et al. for a literature review:\n\n*   **CITATION**: \\cite{xu20242yo}\n\n### 1. Research Problem & Motivation\n\n*   **Specific Technical Problem**: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) faces significant limitations in multi-task learning (MTL) for Large Language Models (LLMs), primarily due to:\n    *   **Reward Hacking**: Reward models, being imperfect proxies of human preferences, are susceptible to being \"hacked,\" leading to models generating less-preferred outputs despite high proxy rewards \\cite{xu20242yo}. This is exacerbated in MTL where multiple reward models may have individual flaws.\n    *   **Extreme Multi-Objective Optimization**: Different tasks often have conflicting objectives (e.g., helpfulness vs. harmlessness), and current RLHF methods using linear combinations of reward models lead to compromises and diminished performance across objectives \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   **Insufficient Fine-grained Alignment**: Reward models struggle to provide accurate guidance for tasks requiring fine-grained criteria, such as correct answers in math or code correctness \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   **Rigid Optimization Strategy**: Standard RLHF applies a uniform optimizer setup across all tasks, which is suboptimal as ideal hyperparameters (e.g., generations per prompt, batch size, KL-regularization) vary significantly between tasks \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n*   **Importance and Challenge**: These limitations are major bottlenecks in effectively improving LLM performance across diverse tasks, hindering the alignment of general-purpose LLMs and requiring extensive, non-generalizable hyperparameter tuning \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n\n### 2. Related Work & Positioning\n\n*   **Relation to Existing Approaches**:\n    *   Prior MTL studies focused on integrating multi-task data during pre-training and fine-tuning \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   Existing RLHF for multi-task post-training typically involves a linear combination of multiple reward models, each reflecting distinct task preferences \\cite{xu20242yo}. Researchers often explore various reward weightings to identify a Pareto front \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n*   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n    *   **Vulnerability to Reward Hacking**: Excessive optimization of a preference-based reward model, an imperfect proxy, can lead to misalignment with true human preferences \\cite{xu20242yo}. This issue is more pronounced in MTL, and uniform early stopping is impractical \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   **Contradictory Goals**: Linear combinations of reward models for conflicting objectives inevitably lead to reduced gains for both, as each task sacrifices its optimization progress \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   **Lack of Fine-grained Control**: Traditional reward models lack the capability to enforce strict, fine-grained criteria (e.g., mathematical correctness) \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   **Suboptimal Uniform Optimization**: Applying a single RL optimizer setup across all tasks is inefficient, as optimal hyperparameters differ significantly based on task characteristics \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n\n### 3. Technical Approach & Innovation\n\n*   **Core Technical Method**: \\cite{xu20242yo} introduces **Constrained Generative Policy Optimization (CGPO)**, a novel post-training paradigm.\n    *   **Mixture of Judges (MoJ)**: At its core, CGPO integrates rule-based and LLM-based judges to identify reward hacking patterns during the LLM's online generation phase \\cite{xu20242yo}. These judges evaluate whether generated samples violate predefined constraints.\n    *   **Cost-Efficient Constrained Policy Optimization with Stratification**: Based on judge evaluations, CGPO employs a constrained RLHF method. This method maximizes the likelihood of generating outputs that adhere to all constraints and achieve high reward values, while minimizing outputs that breach constraints and have low reward values \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   **Task-Specific Optimization**: CGPO segregates prompts by task and applies a customized policy optimization strategy to each set. This includes a tailored MoJ, reward model, and hyperparameter setup for the constrained RLHF optimizer, avoiding compromises from conflicting goals \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n*   **Novelty/Difference**:\n    *   **Principled Mitigation**: CGPO offers a principled approach to simultaneously address reward hacking and extreme multi-objective optimization, moving beyond ad-hoc tuning \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   **New Primal-Type Constrained RLHF Optimizers**: To support large-scale LLM settings, \\cite{xu20242yo} develops three new optimizers (CRPG, CODPO, CRRAFT) that operate independently of dual-variable updates, simplifying and enhancing scalability compared to conventional primal-dual constrained RL algorithms \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   **First Multi-Task RLHF Design with Customized Settings**: This is the first pioneering design in multi-task RLHF to manage each task individually with customized optimization settings, significantly enhancing the Pareto frontier \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n\n### 4. Key Technical Contributions\n\n*   **Novel Algorithms, Methods, or Techniques**:\n    *   **Constrained Generative Policy Optimization (CGPO)**: A new framework for multi-task LLM post-tuning that integrates multiple constraints to mitigate reward hacking \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   **Mixture of Judges (MoJ)**: A system of rule-based and LLM-based judges designed to effectively assess constraint violations in LLM generations across a broad spectrum of NLP tasks \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   **Three new constrained RLHF optimizers**:\n        *   **Calibrated-Regularized Policy Gradient (CRPG)** \\cite{xu20242yo}\n        *   **Constrained Online Direct Preference Optimization (CODPO)** \\cite{xu20242yo}\n        *   **Calibrated-Regularized Reward Ranking Finetuning (CRRAFT)** \\cite{xu20242yo}\n        These are scalable, easy-to-implement primal-type constrained RL methods.\n*   **System Design or Architectural Innovations**:\n    *   **Task-Specific Multi-Objective RLHF Treatment**: CGPO introduces a novel strategy where each task is managed individually with customized optimization settings, including specific reward models, MoJs, and optimizer hyperparameters \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   **Flexible Constraint Judge Module**: The constraint judge can be a rule-based script or an LLM classifier, offering versatility in defining and evaluating constraints \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n*   **Theoretical Insights or Analysis**: CGPO is presented with strong empirical results and theoretical guarantees \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n\n### 5. Experimental Validation\n\n*   **Experiments Conducted**:\n    *   CGPO was evaluated in a challenging multi-task post-training environment encompassing five tasks: general chat, instruction following, math and coding reasoning, engagement intent, and safety \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   The research primarily utilized open-source data and the Llama3.0 70b pre-trained model \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   CGPO was compared against baseline RLHF methods such as PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) and DPO (Rafailov et al., 2024b) \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n*   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n    *   **Consistent Outperformance**: CGPO, particularly when combined with CRPG and CRRAFT optimizers, consistently outperformed PPO and DPO across all benchmarks and tasks \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   **Significant Performance Gains over PPO**:\n        *   AlpacaEval-2 (general chat): 7.4% improvement \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n        *   Arena-Hard (STEM & reasoning): 12.5% improvement \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n        *   IFEval (Instruction Following): 2% improvement \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n        *   MATH and GSM8K (Math & reasoning): 2% improvement in both \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n        *   HumanEval (Coding): 5% improvement \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n        *   ARC challenge (Knowledge): 2% improvement \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   **Optimizer Specific Strengths**: CRPG optimizers achieved the highest performance in MATH, GSM8K, HumanEval, MBPP, ARC Challenge, and false refusal ratio. CRRAFT optimizers excelled in AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, and TruthfulQA \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   **Reward Hacking Mitigation**: PPO exhibited severe reward hacking, evidenced by a significant drop in 0-shot coding benchmarks (HumanEval and MBPP) after certain training steps. In contrast, CGPO not only avoided this regression but consistently improved these benchmarks throughout training, demonstrating the extraordinary capability of MoJs in preventing reward hacking \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n\n### 6. Limitations & Scope\n\n*   **Technical Limitations or Assumptions**:\n    *   The effectiveness of CGPO relies on the ability to define and implement accurate \"judges\" (rule-based or LLM-based) that can reliably identify constraint violations \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   Assumes that prior knowledge about reward model weaknesses can be effectively translated into actionable constraints \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   The paper does not explicitly detail specific technical limitations of the CGPO framework itself, beyond addressing the limitations of prior RLHF methods.\n*   **Scope of Applicability**:\n    *   Primarily designed for multi-task LLM post-training and alignment \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   Applicable to a broad range of NLP tasks, including general chat, instruction following, math, coding, and knowledge-based reasoning, especially where conflicting objectives or fine-grained criteria are present \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   Described as \"plug-and-play\" in common post-training pipelines, suggesting broad integration potential \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n\n### 7. Technical Significance\n\n*   **Advances the Technical State-of-the-Art**:\n    *   CGPO represents a breakthrough in RLHF by simultaneously and robustly addressing the critical issues of reward hacking and extreme multi-objective optimization, which are major bottlenecks in LLM alignment \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   It advances the state-of-the-art in aligning general-purpose LLMs by providing a principled, rather than heuristic, approach to balancing diverse and often contradictory objectives \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   The introduction of MoJs and novel primal-type constrained RLHF optimizers (CRPG, CODPO, CRRAFT) offers new, scalable tools for more effective and controllable LLM fine-tuning \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n*   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n    *   CGPO's framework for task-specific optimization and constraint integration could inspire further research into more granular and adaptive LLM alignment strategies \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   The success of MoJs in detecting and mitigating reward hacking opens avenues for developing more robust and trustworthy LLM evaluation and training mechanisms \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   The novel constrained optimizers could lead to new directions in constrained reinforcement learning, particularly for large-scale, high-dimensional policy optimization problems beyond LLMs \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   It paves the way for developing LLMs that are not only highly capable but also more aligned with complex human preferences and safety requirements across a multitude of tasks \\cite{xu20242yo}.",

Reward hacking and extreme multi-objective optimization lead to compromised performance and misalignment. We introduce **Constrained Generative Policy Optimization (CGPO)**, a novel post-training paradigm that fundamentally redefines LLM alignment. At its heart lies the **Mixture of Judges (MoJ)**, a dynamic system of rule-based and LLM-based judges that proactively identifies and mitigates reward hacking during online generation. Crucially, CGPO pioneers a **task-specific optimization** strategy, allowing each objective to be optimized with tailored reward models, MoJs, and hyperparameters, thereby resolving conflicting goals without compromise. We also present three new scalable primal-type constrained RLHF optimizers: **CRPG, CODPO, and CRRAFT**. Extensive experiments across five diverse tasks demonstrate CGPO's consistent and significant outperformance over PPO and DPO, preventing reward hacking and achieving up to 12.5% gains. This work offers a principled, robust solution for aligning LLMs, paving the way for truly versatile and trustworthy AI.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become the leading approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLM). However, RLHF has limitations in multi-task learning (MTL) due to challenges of reward hacking and extreme multi-objective optimization (i.e., trade-off of multiple and/or sometimes conflicting objectives). Applying RLHF for MTL currently requires careful tuning of the weights for reward model and data combinations. This is often done via human intuition and does not generalize. In this work, we introduce a novel post-training paradigm which we called Constrained Generative Policy Optimization (CGPO). The core of CGPO is Mixture of Judges (MoJ) with cost-efficient constrained policy optimization with stratification, which can identify the perfect blend in RLHF in a principled manner. It shows strong empirical results with theoretical guarantees, does not require extensive hyper-parameter tuning, and is plug-and-play in common post-training pipelines. Together, this can detect and mitigate reward hacking behaviors while reaching a pareto-optimal point across an extremely large number of objectives. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that CGPO significantly outperforms standard RLHF algorithms like PPO and DPO across various tasks including general chat, STEM questions, instruction following, and coding. Specifically, CGPO shows improvements of 7.4% in AlpacaEval-2 (general chat), 12.5% in Arena-Hard (STEM&reasoning), and consistent gains in other domains like math and coding. Notably, PPO, while commonly used, is prone to severe reward hacking in popular coding benchmarks, which CGPO successfully addresses. This breakthrough in RLHF not only tackles reward hacking and extreme multi-objective optimization challenges but also advances the state-of-the-art in aligning general-purpose LLMs for diverse applications.",

This issue is more pronounced in MTL, and uniform early stopping is impractical \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   **Contradictory Goals**: Linear combinations of reward models for conflicting objectives inevitably lead to reduced gains for both, as each task sacrifices its optimization progress \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   **Lack of Fine-grained Control**: Traditional reward models lack the capability to enforce strict, fine-grained criteria (e.g., mathematical correctness) \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   **Suboptimal Uniform Optimization**: Applying a single RL optimizer setup across all tasks is inefficient, as optimal hyperparameters differ significantly based on task characteristics \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n\n### 3. Technical Approach & Innovation\n\n*   **Core Technical Method**: \\cite{xu20242yo} introduces **Constrained Generative Policy Optimization (CGPO)**, a novel post-training paradigm.\n    *   **Mixture of Judges (MoJ)**: At its core, CGPO integrates rule-based and LLM-based judges to identify reward hacking patterns during the LLM's online generation phase \\cite{xu20242yo}. These judges evaluate whether generated samples violate predefined constraints.\n    *   **Cost-Efficient Constrained Policy Optimization with Stratification**: Based on judge evaluations, CGPO employs a constrained RLHF method. This method maximizes the likelihood of generating outputs that adhere to all constraints and achieve high reward values, while minimizing outputs that breach constraints and have low reward values \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   **Task-Specific Optimization**: CGPO segregates prompts by task and applies a customized policy optimization strategy to each set. This includes a tailored MoJ, reward model, and hyperparameter setup for the constrained RLHF optimizer, avoiding compromises from conflicting goals \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n*   **Novelty/Difference**:\n    *   **Principled Mitigation**: CGPO offers a principled approach to simultaneously address reward hacking and extreme multi-objective optimization, moving beyond ad-hoc tuning \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   **New Primal-Type Constrained RLHF Optimizers**: To support large-scale LLM settings, \\cite{xu20242yo} develops three new optimizers (CRPG, CODPO, CRRAFT) that operate independently of dual-variable updates, simplifying and enhancing scalability compared to conventional primal-dual constrained RL algorithms \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   **First Multi-Task RLHF Design with Customized Settings**: This is the first pioneering design in multi-task RLHF to manage each task individually with customized optimization settings, significantly enhancing the Pareto frontier \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n\n### 4. Key Technical Contributions\n\n*   **Novel Algorithms, Methods, or Techniques**:\n    *   **Constrained Generative Policy Optimization (CGPO)**: A new framework for multi-task LLM post-tuning that integrates multiple constraints to mitigate reward hacking \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   **Mixture of Judges (MoJ)**: A system of rule-based and LLM-based judges designed to effectively assess constraint violations in LLM generations across a broad spectrum of NLP tasks \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   **Three new constrained RLHF optimizers**:\n        *   **Calibrated-Regularized Policy Gradient (CRPG)** \\cite{xu20242yo}\n        *   **Constrained Online Direct Preference Optimization (CODPO)** \\cite{xu20242yo}\n        *   **Calibrated-Regularized Reward Ranking Finetuning (CRRAFT)** \\cite{xu20242yo}\n        These are scalable, easy-to-implement primal-type constrained RL methods.\n*   **System Design or Architectural Innovations**:\n    *   **Task-Specific Multi-Objective RLHF Treatment**: CGPO introduces a novel strategy where each task is managed individually with customized optimization settings, including specific reward models, MoJs, and optimizer hyperparameters \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   **Flexible Constraint Judge Module**: The constraint judge can be a rule-based script or an LLM classifier, offering versatility in defining and evaluating constraints \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n*   **Theoretical Insights or Analysis**: CGPO is presented with strong empirical results and theoretical guarantees \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n\n### 5. Experimental Validation\n\n*   **Experiments Conducted**:\n    *   CGPO was evaluated in a challenging multi-task post-training environment encompassing five tasks: general chat, instruction following, math and coding reasoning, engagement intent, and safety \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   The research primarily utilized open-source data and the Llama3.0 70b pre-trained model \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   CGPO was compared against baseline RLHF methods such as PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) and DPO (Rafailov et al., 2024b) \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n*   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n    *   **Consistent Outperformance**: CGPO, particularly when combined with CRPG and CRRAFT optimizers, consistently outperformed PPO and DPO across all benchmarks and tasks \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   **Significant Performance Gains over PPO**:\n        *   AlpacaEval-2 (general chat): 7.4% improvement \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n        *   Arena-Hard (STEM & reasoning): 12.5% improvement \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n        *   IFEval (Instruction Following): 2% improvement \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n        *   MATH and GSM8K (Math & reasoning): 2% improvement in both \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n        *   HumanEval (Coding): 5% improvement \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n        *   ARC challenge (Knowledge): 2% improvement \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   **Optimizer Specific Strengths**: CRPG optimizers achieved the highest performance in MATH, GSM8K, HumanEval, MBPP, ARC Challenge, and false refusal ratio. CRRAFT optimizers excelled in AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, and TruthfulQA \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   **Reward Hacking Mitigation**: PPO exhibited severe reward hacking, evidenced by a significant drop in 0-shot coding benchmarks (HumanEval and MBPP) after certain training steps. In contrast, CGPO not only avoided this regression but consistently improved these benchmarks throughout training, demonstrating the extraordinary capability of MoJs in preventing reward hacking \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n\n### 6. Limitations & Scope\n\n*   **Technical Limitations or Assumptions**:\n    *   The effectiveness of CGPO relies on the ability to define and implement accurate \"judges\" (rule-based or LLM-based) that can reliably identify constraint violations \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   Assumes that prior knowledge about reward model weaknesses can be effectively translated into actionable constraints \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   The paper does not explicitly detail specific technical limitations of the CGPO framework itself, beyond addressing the limitations of prior RLHF methods.\n*   **Scope of Applicability**:\n    *   Primarily designed for multi-task LLM post-training and alignment \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   Applicable to a broad range of NLP tasks, including general chat, instruction following, math, coding, and knowledge-based reasoning, especially where conflicting objectives or fine-grained criteria are present \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   Described as \"plug-and-play\" in common post-training pipelines, suggesting broad integration potential \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n\n### 7. Technical Significance\n\n*   **Advances the Technical State-of-the-Art**:\n    *   CGPO represents a breakthrough in RLHF by simultaneously and robustly addressing the critical issues of reward hacking and extreme multi-objective optimization, which are major bottlenecks in LLM alignment \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   It advances the state-of-the-art in aligning general-purpose LLMs by providing a principled, rather than heuristic, approach to balancing diverse and often contradictory objectives \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   The introduction of MoJs and novel primal-type constrained RLHF optimizers (CRPG, CODPO, CRRAFT) offers new, scalable tools for more effective and controllable LLM fine-tuning \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n*   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n    *   CGPO's framework for task-specific optimization and constraint integration could inspire further research into more granular and adaptive LLM alignment strategies \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   The success of MoJs in detecting and mitigating reward hacking opens avenues for developing more robust and trustworthy LLM evaluation and training mechanisms \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   The novel constrained optimizers could lead to new directions in constrained reinforcement learning, particularly for large-scale, high-dimensional policy optimization problems beyond LLMs \\cite{xu20242yo}.\n    *   It paves the way for developing LLMs that are not only highly capable but also more aligned with complex human preferences and safety requirements across a multitude of tasks \\cite{xu20242yo}.",

    "intriguing_abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is pivotal for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), yet its performance often stagnates due to critical data-driven bottlenecks: rampant reward hacking and diminishing response diversity. Current research largely overlooks the strategic construction of prompt data, focusing instead on algorithmic tweaks. This paper introduces a paradigm shift, presenting novel methodologies to unlock RLHF's full potential. We propose a **hybrid reward system** combining Reasoning Task Verifiers (RTV) and a Generative Reward Model (GenRM), significantly enhancing resistance to reward hacking and ensuring accurate ground-truth assessment. Furthermore, our innovative **Pre-PPO prompt selection** method strategically identifies and prioritizes challenging, low-reward-score prompts, fostering robust learning from fine-grained distinctions. We also reveal that prioritizing mathematical and coding tasks in early RLHF stages dramatically boosts performance. Experimental validation on 25B and 150B parameter models demonstrates that these strategies enable rapid acquisition of subtle task-specific distinctions, leading to substantial performance gains where simple data expansion fails. This work provides a proactive framework for overcoming RLHF's data scalability challenges, offering crucial insights for developing more robust, aligned, and diverse LLMs.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a powerful technique to make large language models (LLMs) more capable in complex settings. RLHF proceeds as collecting human preference data, training a reward model on said data, and optimizing a base ML model with respect to said reward for extrinsic evaluation metrics (e.g. MMLU, GSM8k). RLHF relies on many assumptions about how the various pieces fit together, such as a reward model capturing human preferences and an RL optimizer extracting the right signal from a reward model. As the RLHF process involves many distinct design decisions, it is easy to assume that multiple processes are correlated and therefore numerically linked. This apparent correlation is often not true, where reward models are easily overoptimized or RL optimizers can reduce performance on tasks not modeled in the data. Notable manifestations of models trained with imperfect RLHF systems are those that are prone to refusing basic requests for safety reasons or appearing lazy in generations. As chat model evaluation becomes increasingly nuanced, the reliance on a perceived link between reward model training, RL scores, and downstream performance drives these issues, which we describe as an objective mismatch. In this paper, we illustrate the causes of this issue, reviewing relevant literature from model-based reinforcement learning, and argue for solutions. By solving objective mismatch in RLHF, the ML models of the future will be more precisely aligned to user instructions for both safety and helpfulness.",

Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific technical problem**: The paper addresses the critical issue of \"overoptimization\" in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for Large Language Models (LLMs) \\cite{zhai20238xc}. Overoptimization occurs when optimizing LLMs to maximize reward model (RM) scores beyond a certain threshold leads to a decline in actual human preferences \\cite{zhai20238xc}.\n    *   **Importance and challenge**: This problem is crucial because it undermines the core goal of RLHF: aligning LLMs with human values and preventing the generation of low-quality, fabricated, biased, or harmful content \\cite{zhai20238xc}. The challenge stems from reward models being imperfect proxies for human preferences, often overconfident and susceptible to assigning high rewards to out-of-distribution (OOD) or low-quality samples, misleading the LLM policy \\cite{zhai20238xc}. Existing KL regularization, while common, is shown to be weak for OOD samples and susceptible to overfitting \\cite{zhai20238xc}.\n\n*   **2. Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to existing approaches**: This work builds upon the standard three-step RLHF pipeline, which includes supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modeling, and RL fine-tuning with KL regularization \\cite{zhai20238xc}.\n    *   **Limitations of previous solutions**:\n        *   **KL regularization**: Commonly used to prevent policy deviation from the SFT model, but it is susceptible to overfitting and can lead to a reduction in \"gold performance\" \\cite{zhai20238xc}. The paper theoretically analyzes that KL regularization stemming from the SFT dataset provides weak regularization for low-quality OOD samples \\cite{zhai20238xc}.\n        *   **Other mitigation strategies**: Enlarging RM parameters or training data, or using composite RMs, are often not feasible due to significantly expensive computational costs \\cite{zhai20238xc}.\n\n*   **3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core technical method**: The paper proposes **Uncertainty-Penalized RLHF (UP-RLHF)**, which augments the standard RLHF objective with an additional uncertainty regularization term \\cite{zhai20238xc}. This regularization penalizes rewards based on the estimated uncertainty of the reward model \\cite{zhai20238xc}.\n    *   **Novelty/Differentiation**:\n        *   **Diverse Reward LoRA Ensemble**: To enhance uncertainty quantification in reward models, the authors introduce a novel method to train a diverse ensemble of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules \\cite{zhai20238xc}. This diversity is actively promoted by maximizing the nuclear norm of concatenated LoRA matrices (specifically, the 'A' matrices) during training, which serves as a convex surrogate for matrix rank to encourage linear independence among ensemble members \\cite{zhai20238xc}. This is a parameter-efficient approach compared to traditional deep ensembles \\cite{zhai20238xc}.\n        *   **Uncertainty Penalization**: Policy models are optimized using a modified reward function that subtracts a scaled uncertainty term (standard deviation of ensemble predictions) from the predicted reward \\cite{zhai20238xc}. This prevents LLMs from generating high-uncertainty, low-quality content where KL regularization is weak \\cite{zhai20238xc}.\n        *   **Decoupled Regularization**: The KL regularization term is optimized independently via gradient descent using a lower-variance estimator, separating it from the uncertainty-penalized actor loss \\cite{zhai20238xc}.\n\n*   **4.

Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments conducted**: Evaluated UP-RLHF on two widely used RLHF tasks: summarization (using the TL;DR dataset) and question-answering (using the Anthropic Helpful dataset) \\cite{zhai20238xc}. Policy models were OPT-1.3B (summarization) and Llama2-7B (QA), with corresponding reward models \\cite{zhai20238xc}. Gold reward models (GPT-J-6B and SteamSHP-XL) were used as proxies for human preferences \\cite{zhai20238xc}.\n    *   **Key performance metrics and comparison results**:\n        *   **Reward Model Evaluation (RQ1)**: The diverse reward LoRA ensemble significantly improved both accuracy (ACC) and reduced Expected Calibration Error (ECE) compared to full fine-tuning and standard LoRA ensembles, demonstrating superior uncertainty quantification abilities \\cite{zhai20238xc}. The diverse ensemble showed better OOD detection, with uncertainty growing rapidly for samples with high KL divergence \\cite{zhai20238xc}.\n        *   **Overoptimization Mitigation (RQ2)**: Uncertainty penalization in UP-RLHF proved pivotal in mitigating overoptimization, leading to higher gold rewards compared to baselines \\cite{zhai20238xc}.\n        *   **Overall Performance (RQ3)**: UP-RLHF consistently outperformed existing RLHF methods in terms of gold reward on both summarization and question-answering tasks, indicating improved alignment with human preferences \\cite{zhai20238xc}.\n\n*   **6. Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical limitations/assumptions**: The theoretical derivation approximates the partition function Z(x) as 1 and uses $\\pi_{SFT}$ as an approximation for the intractable behavior policy $\\pi_D$ \\cite{zhai20238xc}. The effectiveness of nuclear norm maximization relies on its ability to accurately promote diversity that translates to better uncertainty quantification.\n    *   **Scope of applicability**: The method is primarily demonstrated for LLM alignment tasks like summarization and question-answering \\cite{zhai20238xc}. While the core idea of uncertainty regularization and diverse LoRA ensembles could be generalized, its direct applicability is shown within the RLHF paradigm for text generation.\n\n*   **7. Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances the technical state-of-the-art**: This paper presents a significant advancement in RLHF by effectively addressing the critical overoptimization problem, which has been a major hurdle in aligning LLMs with human preferences \\cite{zhai20238xc}. It moves beyond simple KL regularization by introducing a more robust uncertainty-aware regularization strategy \\cite{zhai20238xc}.\n    *   **Potential impact on future research**: The proposed diverse LoRA ensemble method offers a parameter-efficient and effective way to quantify uncertainty in large models, which could be highly impactful for other applications requiring reliable uncertainty estimates, such as safety-critical AI systems or active learning \\cite{zhai20238xc}. The UP-RLHF framework provides a blueprint for developing more robust and aligned LLMs, fostering research into advanced regularization techniques for complex reinforcement learning systems \\cite{zhai20238xc}.",

However, a notable challenge in RLHF is overoptimization, where beyond a certain threshold, the pursuit of higher rewards leads to a decline in human preferences.

To mitigate this limitation, we scrutinize the RLHF objective in the offline dataset and propose uncertainty-penalized RLHF (UP-RLHF), which incorporates uncertainty regularization during RL-finetuning. To enhance the uncertainty quantification abilities for reward models, we first propose a diverse low-rank adaptation (LoRA) ensemble by maximizing the nuclear norm of LoRA matrix concatenations. Then we optimize policy models utilizing penalized rewards, determined by both rewards and uncertainties provided by the diverse reward LoRA ensembles. Our experimental results, based on two real human preference datasets, showcase the effectiveness of diverse reward LoRA ensembles in quantifying reward uncertainty. Additionally, uncertainty regularization in UP-RLHF proves to be pivotal in mitigating overoptimization, thereby contributing to the overall performance.",

This regularization penalizes rewards based on the estimated uncertainty of the reward model \\cite{zhai20238xc}.\n    *   **Novelty/Differentiation**:\n        *   **Diverse Reward LoRA Ensemble**: To enhance uncertainty quantification in reward models, the authors introduce a novel method to train a diverse ensemble of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules \\cite{zhai20238xc}. This diversity is actively promoted by maximizing the nuclear norm of concatenated LoRA matrices (specifically, the 'A' matrices) during training, which serves as a convex surrogate for matrix rank to encourage linear independence among ensemble members \\cite{zhai20238xc}. This is a parameter-efficient approach compared to traditional deep ensembles \\cite{zhai20238xc}.\n        *   **Uncertainty Penalization**: Policy models are optimized using a modified reward function that subtracts a scaled uncertainty term (standard deviation of ensemble predictions) from the predicted reward \\cite{zhai20238xc}. This prevents LLMs from generating high-uncertainty, low-quality content where KL regularization is weak \\cite{zhai20238xc}.\n        *   **Decoupled Regularization**: The KL regularization term is optimized independently via gradient descent using a lower-variance estimator, separating it from the uncertainty-penalized actor loss \\cite{zhai20238xc}.\n\n*   **4. Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel algorithms/methods**:\n        *   The UP-RLHF framework, which integrates uncertainty regularization into the RLHF objective to combat overoptimization \\cite{zhai20238xc}.\n        *   A novel method for training diverse reward LoRA ensembles by maximizing the nuclear norm of concatenated LoRA matrices, enabling effective and parameter-efficient uncertainty quantification \\cite{zhai20238xc}.\n        *   A strategy to penalize rewards with estimated uncertainties (standard deviation across the ensemble) during RL fine-tuning \\cite{zhai20238xc}.\n    *   **Theoretical insights**: Analysis of the RLHF objective in the offline dataset setting, highlighting the limitations of KL regularization for OOD samples and providing a theoretical basis for incorporating uncertainty regularization \\cite{zhai20238xc}.\n\n*   **5. Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments conducted**: Evaluated UP-RLHF on two widely used RLHF tasks: summarization (using the TL;DR dataset) and question-answering (using the Anthropic Helpful dataset) \\cite{zhai20238xc}. Policy models were OPT-1.3B (summarization) and Llama2-7B (QA), with corresponding reward models \\cite{zhai20238xc}. Gold reward models (GPT-J-6B and SteamSHP-XL) were used as proxies for human preferences \\cite{zhai20238xc}.\n    *   **Key performance metrics and comparison results**:\n        *   **Reward Model Evaluation (RQ1)**: The diverse reward LoRA ensemble significantly improved both accuracy (ACC) and reduced Expected Calibration Error (ECE) compared to full fine-tuning and standard LoRA ensembles, demonstrating superior uncertainty quantification abilities \\cite{zhai20238xc}. The diverse ensemble showed better OOD detection, with uncertainty growing rapidly for samples with high KL divergence \\cite{zhai20238xc}.\n        *   **Overoptimization Mitigation (RQ2)**: Uncertainty penalization in UP-RLHF proved pivotal in mitigating overoptimization, leading to higher gold rewards compared to baselines \\cite{zhai20238xc}.\n        *   **Overall Performance (RQ3)**: UP-RLHF consistently outperformed existing RLHF methods in terms of gold reward on both summarization and question-answering tasks, indicating improved alignment with human preferences \\cite{zhai20238xc}.\n\n*   **6. Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical limitations/assumptions**: The theoretical derivation approximates the partition function Z(x) as 1 and uses $\\pi_{SFT}$ as an approximation for the intractable behavior policy $\\pi_D$ \\cite{zhai20238xc}. The effectiveness of nuclear norm maximization relies on its ability to accurately promote diversity that translates to better uncertainty quantification.\n    *   **Scope of applicability**: The method is primarily demonstrated for LLM alignment tasks like summarization and question-answering \\cite{zhai20238xc}. While the core idea of uncertainty regularization and diverse LoRA ensembles could be generalized, its direct applicability is shown within the RLHF paradigm for text generation.\n\n*   **7. Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances the technical state-of-the-art**: This paper presents a significant advancement in RLHF by effectively addressing the critical overoptimization problem, which has been a major hurdle in aligning LLMs with human preferences \\cite{zhai20238xc}. It moves beyond simple KL regularization by introducing a more robust uncertainty-aware regularization strategy \\cite{zhai20238xc}.\n    *   **Potential impact on future research**: The proposed diverse LoRA ensemble method offers a parameter-efficient and effective way to quantify uncertainty in large models, which could be highly impactful for other applications requiring reliable uncertainty estimates, such as safety-critical AI systems or active learning \\cite{zhai20238xc}. The UP-RLHF framework provides a blueprint for developing more robust and aligned LLMs, fostering research into advanced regularization techniques for complex reinforcement learning systems \\cite{zhai20238xc}.",

    "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review, emphasizing technical innovations and empirical validation:\n\n### Analysis of `SimpleTIR: End-to-End Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning` \\cite{xue2025fl1}\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the significant training instability and performance collapse encountered when applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to multi-turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) in Large Language Models (LLMs).\n    *   **Importance & Challenge**: Multi-turn TIR is crucial for LLMs to overcome inherent limitations (e.g., poor computational accuracy, knowledge cutoffs) by interacting with external tools (e.g., Python interpreters, search engines). However, this process is highly challenging due to a \"distributional drift\" from external tool feedback, leading to the generation of low-probability tokens. This issue compounds over turns, causing \"catastrophic gradient norm explosions\" and misaligned credit assignment, which derail the RL training process.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Previous work often attempts to stabilize multi-turn TIR by \"cold starting\" the model with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) \\cite{xue2025fl1}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: SFT, while improving stability, can \"constrain the model’s discovery of novel reasoning strategies,\" undermining the benefits of Zero RL training, which aims for emergent problem-solving and diverse reasoning behaviors \\cite{xue2025fl1}. Simple heuristics like masking high-perplexity trajectories or clipping importance ratios also fail to resolve instability in multi-turn TIR due to difficult-to-tune thresholds and an inability to solve the credit assignment problem \\cite{xue2025fl1}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: `SimpleTIR` introduces a plug-and-play trajectory filtering algorithm that stabilizes multi-turn TIR training. Its core strategy is to identify and filter out entire trajectories containing \"void turns\" from the policy update \\cite{xue2025fl1}. A \"void turn\" is defined as an LLM response that yields neither a complete code block nor a final answer, often indicative of distributional drift and high generation stochasticity.\n    *   **Novelty**: The approach is novel because it directly addresses the root cause of instability (low-probability tokens and resulting gradient explosions) by strategically removing problematic trajectories. This avoids the need for SFT, allowing the model to discover diverse and sophisticated reasoning patterns. It's also \"general and plug-and-play,\" requiring minimal modifications to integrate into existing RL frameworks \\cite{xue2025fl1}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithm**: The `SimpleTIR` algorithm for trajectory filtering based on \"void turns,\" which effectively blocks harmful, high-magnitude gradients and corrects misaligned credit assignment \\cite{xue2025fl1}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights**: A theoretical analysis of the gradient norm with respect to pre-softmax logits, demonstrating how low-probability tokens lead to gradient explosions through unbounded importance ratios and sustained high gradient norms \\cite{xue2025fl1}.\n    *   **Enabling Zero RL**: A robust method for training multi-turn TIR agents using Zero RL, fostering emergent reasoning patterns like self-correction, cross-validation, and progressive reasoning, which are often suppressed by SFT-based approaches \\cite{xue2025fl1}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Comprehensive experiments were conducted on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks using the Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-32B base models \\cite{xue2025fl1}. Ablation studies were performed to confirm the efficacy of void turn filtering.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results**:\n        *   `SimpleTIR` achieved state-of-the-art performance on math reasoning benchmarks, significantly elevating the AIME24 score from a text-only baseline of 22.1 to 50.5 when starting from the Qwen2.5-7B base model \\cite{xue2025fl1}.\n        *   It also showed strong performance across other benchmarks, including AIME25, MATH500, Olympiad, AMC23, and Hmmt 25, outperforming other Zero RL and SFT-based TIR methods \\cite{xue2025fl1}.\n        *   Training dynamics showed high stability with `SimpleTIR`, maintaining well-behaved gradient norms with almost no spikes, in stark contrast to naive multi-turn training which suffered from unstable dynamics and catastrophic gradient explosions \\cite{xue2025fl1}.\n        *   Ablation studies confirmed that filtering trajectories with void turns is the crucial component for stabilizing training and enabling performance gains \\cite{xue2025fl1}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The paper does not explicitly state limitations of `SimpleTIR` itself, but rather highlights its robustness compared to other methods. The effectiveness relies on the clear definition and detection of \"void turns\" (absence of complete code block or final answer), which is well-suited for code-execution-based TIR.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: `SimpleTIR` is designed for end-to-end RL training of multi-turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning agents, particularly those involving code execution and external tool feedback. It is presented as being \"agnostic to the specific RL algorithm used\" and \"orthogonal to other recent improvements in RL for LLM reasoning\" \\cite{xue2025fl1}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: `SimpleTIR` significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing a robust and effective solution to the long-standing problem of training instability in multi-turn TIR with RL \\cite{xue2025fl1}. It enables successful Zero RL training, which was previously hindered by gradient explosions and credit assignment issues.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: By stabilizing multi-turn RL without relying on SFT, `SimpleTIR` opens new avenues for research into emergent and diverse reasoning capabilities in LLMs. It encourages the discovery of more sophisticated problem-solving strategies and could lead to more generalizable and adaptable tool-using agents \\cite{xue2025fl1}.",

We identify that such instability is primarily caused by a distributional drift from external tool feedback, leading to the generation of low-probability tokens. This issue compounds over successive turns, causing catastrophic gradient norm explosions that derail the training process. To address this challenge, we introduce SimpleTIR , a plug-and-play algorithm that stabilizes multi-turn TIR training.

      "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review, emphasizing technical innovations and empirical validation:\n\n### Analysis of `SimpleTIR: End-to-End Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning` \\cite{xue2025fl1}\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the significant training instability and performance collapse encountered when applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to multi-turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) in Large Language Models (LLMs).\n    *   **Importance & Challenge**: Multi-turn TIR is crucial for LLMs to overcome inherent limitations (e.g., poor computational accuracy, knowledge cutoffs) by interacting with external tools (e.g., Python interpreters, search engines). However, this process is highly challenging due to a \"distributional drift\" from external tool feedback, leading to the generation of low-probability tokens. This issue compounds over turns, causing \"catastrophic gradient norm explosions\" and misaligned credit assignment, which derail the RL training process.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Previous work often attempts to stabilize multi-turn TIR by \"cold starting\" the model with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) \\cite{xue2025fl1}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: SFT, while improving stability, can \"constrain the model’s discovery of novel reasoning strategies,\" undermining the benefits of Zero RL training, which aims for emergent problem-solving and diverse reasoning behaviors \\cite{xue2025fl1}. Simple heuristics like masking high-perplexity trajectories or clipping importance ratios also fail to resolve instability in multi-turn TIR due to difficult-to-tune thresholds and an inability to solve the credit assignment problem \\cite{xue2025fl1}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: `SimpleTIR` introduces a plug-and-play trajectory filtering algorithm that stabilizes multi-turn TIR training. Its core strategy is to identify and filter out entire trajectories containing \"void turns\" from the policy update \\cite{xue2025fl1}. A \"void turn\" is defined as an LLM response that yields neither a complete code block nor a final answer, often indicative of distributional drift and high generation stochasticity.\n    *   **Novelty**: The approach is novel because it directly addresses the root cause of instability (low-probability tokens and resulting gradient explosions) by strategically removing problematic trajectories. This avoids the need for SFT, allowing the model to discover diverse and sophisticated reasoning patterns. It's also \"general and plug-and-play,\" requiring minimal modifications to integrate into existing RL frameworks \\cite{xue2025fl1}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithm**: The `SimpleTIR` algorithm for trajectory filtering based on \"void turns,\" which effectively blocks harmful, high-magnitude gradients and corrects misaligned credit assignment \\cite{xue2025fl1}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights**: A theoretical analysis of the gradient norm with respect to pre-softmax logits, demonstrating how low-probability tokens lead to gradient explosions through unbounded importance ratios and sustained high gradient norms \\cite{xue2025fl1}.\n    *   **Enabling Zero RL**: A robust method for training multi-turn TIR agents using Zero RL, fostering emergent reasoning patterns like self-correction, cross-validation, and progressive reasoning, which are often suppressed by SFT-based approaches \\cite{xue2025fl1}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Comprehensive experiments were conducted on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks using the Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-32B base models \\cite{xue2025fl1}. Ablation studies were performed to confirm the efficacy of void turn filtering.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results**:\n        *   `SimpleTIR` achieved state-of-the-art performance on math reasoning benchmarks, significantly elevating the AIME24 score from a text-only baseline of 22.1 to 50.5 when starting from the Qwen2.5-7B base model \\cite{xue2025fl1}.\n        *   It also showed strong performance across other benchmarks, including AIME25, MATH500, Olympiad, AMC23, and Hmmt 25, outperforming other Zero RL and SFT-based TIR methods \\cite{xue2025fl1}.\n        *   Training dynamics showed high stability with `SimpleTIR`, maintaining well-behaved gradient norms with almost no spikes, in stark contrast to naive multi-turn training which suffered from unstable dynamics and catastrophic gradient explosions \\cite{xue2025fl1}.\n        *   Ablation studies confirmed that filtering trajectories with void turns is the crucial component for stabilizing training and enabling performance gains \\cite{xue2025fl1}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The paper does not explicitly state limitations of `SimpleTIR` itself, but rather highlights its robustness compared to other methods. The effectiveness relies on the clear definition and detection of \"void turns\" (absence of complete code block or final answer), which is well-suited for code-execution-based TIR.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: `SimpleTIR` is designed for end-to-end RL training of multi-turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning agents, particularly those involving code execution and external tool feedback. It is presented as being \"agnostic to the specific RL algorithm used\" and \"orthogonal to other recent improvements in RL for LLM reasoning\" \\cite{xue2025fl1}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: `SimpleTIR` significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing a robust and effective solution to the long-standing problem of training instability in multi-turn TIR with RL \\cite{xue2025fl1}. It enables successful Zero RL training, which was previously hindered by gradient explosions and credit assignment issues.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: By stabilizing multi-turn RL without relying on SFT, `SimpleTIR` opens new avenues for research into emergent and diverse reasoning capabilities in LLMs. It encourages the discovery of more sophisticated problem-solving strategies and could lead to more generalizable and adaptable tool-using agents \\cite{xue2025fl1}.",

    "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review, emphasizing technical innovations and empirical validation:\n\n*   **CITATION**: \\cite{zheng2024voy}\n\n### 1. Research Problem & Motivation\n\n*   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the degradation of foundational capabilities (e.g., forgetting, reduced general abilities, over-specialization) in Large Language Models (LLMs) after Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Additionally, SFT-tuned models often struggle with user preference alignment, leading to an increased generation of toxic outputs.\n*   **Importance and Challenge**: This problem is critical because SFT is a traditional, widely used step for adapting pre-trained LLMs to specific applications. Its limitations compromise model versatility, efficiency, safety, and reliability in conversational scenarios, especially when dealing with hundreds of unpredictable downstream tasks or maintaining a balance between task-specific optimization and general knowledge retention. The challenge lies in enhancing conversational abilities and safety without sacrificing the base model's broad general capabilities.\n\n### 2. Related Work & Positioning\n\n*   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: The work relates to existing LLM alignment techniques, particularly Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which typically follows an SFT phase. It also acknowledges the success of direct preference optimization methods like DPO, ΦPO, and KTO that bypass explicit reward functions.\n*   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n    *   **SFT Limitations**: Causes degradation of base model capabilities due to over-specialization and biases introduced by less consistent, task-specific datasets compared to high-quality pre-training data. It also exacerbates issues with user preference alignment and toxic output generation.\n    *   **RLHF Limitations (with SFT)**: While successful, the underlying mechanisms of RLHF are only partially comprehended. Convergence in RLHF can be unstable or fail if the reward functions underlying SFT and RLHF datasets do not closely align. Prior research suggests that SFT (behavior cloning) does not invariably enhance RLHF efficacy.\n\n### 3. Technical Approach & Innovation\n\n*   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes \"Direct Harmless Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)\" which *completely bypasses the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) phase*. This method directly aligns the base model with human preferences for helpfulness and harmlessness.\n*   **Novelty/Difference**:\n    *   **SFT Bypass**: The most significant innovation is the complete elimination of SFT, which is a standard initial step in most RLHF pipelines (e.g., Ouyang et al., 2022). This directly tackles the observed degradation issues caused by SFT.\n    *   **Direct Harmless RLHF**: The approach directly applies RLHF using a \"Helpful and Harmless Reward Model\" trained on human-annotated preference data (Bai et al., 2022).\n    *   **Response Length Optimization**: A crucial training trick discovered is optimizing for shorter response lengths during RLHF. This is found to significantly contribute to enhancements and stability, preventing \"unhealthy\" reward score improvements stemming from excessively long outputs.\n    *   **Model Architecture**: Utilizes the PPO algorithm with an Actor model (initialized from Mistral-Base 7B), a Critic model, a Reward model, and a Reference model.\n\n### 4.

    "intriguing_abstract": "Traditional alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) often degrades foundational capabilities, leading to forgetting, over-specialization, and increased toxic outputs, compromising versatility and safety. This paper introduces a groundbreaking \"Direct Harmless Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)\" framework that entirely bypasses the SFT phase, challenging its long-held necessity in LLM alignment. Our novel approach directly aligns a base LLM using a combined helpfulness and harmlessness reward model, employing the PPO algorithm. A critical innovation is the discovery and implementation of response length optimization during RLHF, which significantly enhances training stability and effectiveness.\n\nEmpirical validation with Mistral-Plus 7B demonstrates remarkable results. Our model not only preserves and enhances the base model's general knowledge across 11 diverse benchmarks but also achieves outstanding conversational performance on MT-Bench, surpassing all similarly sized SFT-tuned models. Crucially, Mistral-Plus significantly reduces toxic outputs, ensuring robust safety. This work redefines LLM alignment, proving that superior conversational AI, enhanced safety, and preserved general capabilities can be achieved more efficiently by directly applying RLHF, paving the way for more versatile and reliable LLMs.",

      "abstract": "In recent advancements in Conversational Large Language Models (LLMs), a concerning trend has emerged, showing that many new base LLMs experience a knowledge reduction in their foundational capabilities following Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This process often leads to issues such as forgetting or a decrease in the base model's abilities. Moreover, fine-tuned models struggle to align with user preferences, inadvertently increasing the generation of toxic outputs when specifically prompted. To overcome these challenges, we adopted an innovative approach by completely bypassing SFT and directly implementing Harmless Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Our method not only preserves the base model's general capabilities but also significantly enhances its conversational abilities, while notably reducing the generation of toxic outputs. Our approach holds significant implications for fields that demand a nuanced understanding and generation of responses, such as customer service. We applied this methodology to Mistral, the most popular base model, thereby creating Mistral-Plus. Our validation across 11 general tasks demonstrates that Mistral-Plus outperforms similarly sized open-source base models and their corresponding instruct versions. Importantly, the conversational abilities of Mistral-Plus were significantly improved, indicating a substantial advancement over traditional SFT models in both safety and user preference alignment.",

      "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review, emphasizing technical innovations and empirical validation:\n\n*   **CITATION**: \\cite{zheng2024voy}\n\n### 1. Research Problem & Motivation\n\n*   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the degradation of foundational capabilities (e.g., forgetting, reduced general abilities, over-specialization) in Large Language Models (LLMs) after Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Additionally, SFT-tuned models often struggle with user preference alignment, leading to an increased generation of toxic outputs.\n*   **Importance and Challenge**: This problem is critical because SFT is a traditional, widely used step for adapting pre-trained LLMs to specific applications. Its limitations compromise model versatility, efficiency, safety, and reliability in conversational scenarios, especially when dealing with hundreds of unpredictable downstream tasks or maintaining a balance between task-specific optimization and general knowledge retention. The challenge lies in enhancing conversational abilities and safety without sacrificing the base model's broad general capabilities.\n\n### 2. Related Work & Positioning\n\n*   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: The work relates to existing LLM alignment techniques, particularly Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which typically follows an SFT phase. It also acknowledges the success of direct preference optimization methods like DPO, ΦPO, and KTO that bypass explicit reward functions.\n*   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n    *   **SFT Limitations**: Causes degradation of base model capabilities due to over-specialization and biases introduced by less consistent, task-specific datasets compared to high-quality pre-training data. It also exacerbates issues with user preference alignment and toxic output generation.\n    *   **RLHF Limitations (with SFT)**: While successful, the underlying mechanisms of RLHF are only partially comprehended. Convergence in RLHF can be unstable or fail if the reward functions underlying SFT and RLHF datasets do not closely align. Prior research suggests that SFT (behavior cloning) does not invariably enhance RLHF efficacy.\n\n### 3. Technical Approach & Innovation\n\n*   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes \"Direct Harmless Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)\" which *completely bypasses the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) phase*. This method directly aligns the base model with human preferences for helpfulness and harmlessness.\n*   **Novelty/Difference**:\n    *   **SFT Bypass**: The most significant innovation is the complete elimination of SFT, which is a standard initial step in most RLHF pipelines (e.g., Ouyang et al., 2022). This directly tackles the observed degradation issues caused by SFT.\n    *   **Direct Harmless RLHF**: The approach directly applies RLHF using a \"Helpful and Harmless Reward Model\" trained on human-annotated preference data (Bai et al., 2022).\n    *   **Response Length Optimization**: A crucial training trick discovered is optimizing for shorter response lengths during RLHF. This is found to significantly contribute to enhancements and stability, preventing \"unhealthy\" reward score improvements stemming from excessively long outputs.\n    *   **Model Architecture**: Utilizes the PPO algorithm with an Actor model (initialized from Mistral-Base 7B), a Critic model, a Reward model, and a Reference model.\n\n### 4.

      "abstract": "Affective Computing (AC) integrates computer science, psychology, and cognitive science to enable machines to recognize, interpret, and simulate human emotions across domains such as social media, finance, healthcare, and education. AC commonly centers on two task families: Affective Understanding (AU) and Affective Generation (AG). While fine-tuned pre-trained language models (PLMs) have achieved solid AU performance, they often generalize poorly across tasks and remain limited for AG, especially in producing diverse, emotionally appropriate responses. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g., ChatGPT and LLaMA) has catalyzed a paradigm shift by offering in-context learning, broader world knowledge, and stronger sequence generation. This survey presents an NLP-oriented overview of AC in the LLM era. We (i) consolidate traditional AC tasks and preliminary LLM-based studies; (ii) review adaptation techniques that improve AU/AG, including Instruction Tuning (full and parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA, P-/Prompt-Tuning), Prompt Engineering (zero/few-shot, chain-of-thought, agent-based prompting), and Reinforcement Learning. For the latter, we summarize RL from human preferences (RLHF), verifiable/programmatic rewards (RLVR), and AI feedback (RLAIF), which provide preference- or rule-grounded optimization signals that can help steer AU/AG toward empathy, safety, and planning, achieving finer-grained or multi-objective control. To assess progress, we compile benchmarks and evaluation practices for both AU and AG. We also discuss open challenges-from ethics, data quality, and safety to robust evaluation and resource efficiency-and outline research directions. We hope this survey clarifies the landscape and offers practical guidance for building affect-aware, reliable, and responsible LLM systems.",

Experimental Validation\n\n*   As a survey paper, \\cite{zhang20242mw} does not present new experimental validation. Instead, it *compiles and reviews* the experimental validation conducted by the numerous papers it surveys.\n*   **Compilation of Benchmarks**: The paper dedicates a section (§7) to summarizing existing benchmarks for Affective Understanding (e.g., SOUL, GPT-4v with Emotion, MERBench) and Affective Generation (e.g., Cue-CoT, ESC-Eval, MEDIC, EmotionBench) \\cite{zhang20242mw}.\n*   **Evaluation Practices**: It discusses various evaluation practices, including the innovative use of LLMs themselves as evaluation tools, to assess the performance of LLM-based AC systems \\cite{zhang20242mw}. The survey implicitly validates the effectiveness of the reviewed techniques by citing studies that demonstrate performance improvements in AU and AG tasks using LLMs.\n\n### 6. Limitations & Scope\n\n*   **Scope of Applicability**: The survey primarily focuses on Affective Computing from an **NLP perspective**, although it includes text-centric multimodal affective computing tasks \\cite{zhang20242mw}.\n*   **Identified Technical Limitations (within the field)**: The survey highlights several technical limitations and challenges *within the field* of LLM-based AC, such as the need for improved data quality, more robust and reliable evaluation methods, addressing ethical concerns, and enhancing resource efficiency for training and deployment of LLMs in AC tasks \\cite{zhang20242mw}.\n\n### 7. Technical Significance\n\n*   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: This survey significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing a much-needed structured and comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving field of Affective Computing in the LLM era \\cite{zhang20242mw}. It clarifies the complex landscape, making it easier for researchers to understand current capabilities, limitations, and emerging trends.\n*   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: It serves as a foundational resource, offering practical guidance for researchers and practitioners aiming to build affect-aware, reliable, and responsible LLM systems \\cite{zhang20242mw}. By systematically outlining adaptation techniques, evaluation methods, and open challenges, it helps to identify promising future research directions, such as developing more robust evaluation metrics, addressing ethical concerns, improving data quality, and enhancing resource efficiency in LLM-based AC \\cite{zhang20242mw}.",

Our experiments on four high-performing open-sourced LLMs demonstrate ProMan's effectiveness in exposing these vulnerabilities with minimal computational cost and without complex prompt design.

However, many existing studies have shown that they could be misused to generate undesired content. In response, before releasing LLMs for public access, model developers usually align those language models through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). Consequently, those aligned large language models refuse to generate undesired content when facing potentially harmful/unethical requests. A natural question is\"could alignment really prevent those open-sourced large language models from being misused to generate undesired content?''. In this work, we provide a negative answer to this question. In particular, we show those open-sourced, aligned large language models could be easily misguided to generate undesired content without heavy computations or careful prompt designs. Our key idea is to directly manipulate the generation process of open-sourced LLMs to misguide it to generate undesired content including harmful or biased information and even private data. We evaluate our method on 4 open-sourced LLMs accessible publicly and our finding highlights the need for more advanced mitigation strategies for open-sourced LLMs.",

Although RLHF is considered an important step in post-training of LLMs, its scaling potential is still largely unknown. We systematically analyze key components in the RLHF framework--model size, data composition, and inference budget--and their impacts on performance. Our findings show that increasing data diversity and volume improves reward model performance, helping process-supervision models scale better. For policy training, more response samples per prompt boost performance initially but quickly plateau. And larger reward models offer modest gains in policy training. In addition, larger policy models benefit less from RLHF with a fixed reward model. Overall, RLHF scales less efficiently than pretraining, with diminishing returns from additional computational resources. Based on these observations, we propose strategies to optimize RLHF performance within computational limits.",

    "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Reinforcement Learning (RL) for aligning language models (LMs) with non-differentiable reward signals (e.g., human preferences) suffers from *sparse reward signals*. Typically, only a single reward is provided for an entire generated output.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge**: This sparsity leads to inefficient and unstable learning, creating a significant \"temporal credit assignment problem\" where it's hard to determine which specific tokens contributed to the final reward. Existing solutions like reward shaping, curiosity-driven exploration, or hierarchical RL often require handcrafted features or do not translate well to text generation.

However, a major challenge arises from the sparsity of these reward signals - typically, there is only a single reward for an entire output. This sparsity of rewards can lead to inefficient and unstable learning. To address this challenge, our paper introduces an novel framework that utilizes the critique capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce intermediate-step rewards during RL training. Our method involves coupling a policy model with a critic language model, which is responsible for providing comprehensive feedback of each part of the output. This feedback is then translated into token or span-level rewards that can be used to guide the RL training process. We investigate this approach under two different settings: one where the policy model is smaller and is paired with a more powerful critic model, and another where a single language model fulfills both roles. We assess our approach on three text generation tasks: sentiment control, language model detoxification, and summarization. Experimental results show that incorporating artificial intrinsic rewards significantly improve both sample efficiency and the overall performance of the policy model, supported by both automatic and human evaluation.",

It seeks to explain *why, when, and how* RL excels in LLM alignment.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: LLMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4 achieve proficiency in instruction following and generating helpful, harmless, and honest (3H) responses largely due to RLHF. Understanding the underlying RL principles is crucial for further advancements, especially given the high action dimensionality and feedback sparsity in LLM generation tasks \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relationship to Existing Approaches**: The paper positions RLHF within the broader landscape of RL, specifically comparing it to Online RL, Offline RL, Imitation Learning (IL), Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), and Learning from Demonstrations (LfD) \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   **Offline RL**: Suffers from distributional shift and compounding error due to the inability to explore and the static nature of the dataset \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n        *   **Behavior Cloning (BC)** (which Supervised Fine-Tuning, SFT, is analogous to): Prone to compounding errors, where initial mistakes lead to out-of-distribution states and subsequent errors, resulting in a quadratic error bound with trajectory length \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n        *   **Reward Engineering**: Conventional RL often struggles with tasks where defining an explicit, dense reward function is difficult or results in sparse feedback (e.g., \"win/lose\" in Go) \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper argues that RLHF, despite appearing as an Offline RL problem due to the use of offline human preference data, is fundamentally an **Online Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) problem** \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**: The key insight is that the **transition dynamics model in LLM response generation is known** (i.e., the auto-regressive concatenation of tokens) \\cite{sun2023awe}. This allows RLHF to leverage the benefits of Online IL/IRL, which alleviates the compounding error and distributional shift problems inherent in pure Offline RL or Behavior Cloning approaches like SFT \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n    *   **Two-step IRL process**: RLHF explicitly learns a reward model from human preference data (the \"inverse\" part) and then uses this learned reward model with the known dynamics model to perform online RL (e.g., using PPO) \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Conceptual Framework**: Formalizes RLHF as \"Online Inverse RL with Offline Demonstration Data,\" providing a clear theoretical link between LLM alignment techniques and established RL paradigms \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n    *   **Problem Re-framing**: Identifies the known transition dynamics of LLMs as the critical factor that transforms the seemingly offline RL problem of RLHF into an online IL/IRL problem, thereby mitigating common challenges like compounding error and distributional shift \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n    *   **Explanation for RLHF's Superiority**: Provides an RL-centric explanation for why RLHF outperforms SFT: RLHF benefits from IL's ability to access the dynamics model, while SFT is analogous to Behavior Cloning, which suffers from compounding error \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n    *   **Generalizable Insight**: Highlights that the Reward Model (RM) step in RLHF acts as a proxy for expensive human feedback, an insight that can be generalized to other LLM tasks requiring costly feedback evaluation and optimization \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n    *   **Analysis of PPO**: Discusses the empirical superiority of PPO in RLHF, attributing its stability to (almost) on-policy data and conservative policy updates, while also pointing out its challenges in sparse reward settings and high computational demands \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   This paper is a technical perspective and review, not presenting new experimental results. Instead, it analyzes existing practices and findings in the field.\n    *   **Implicit Validation**: The analysis draws upon the observed success of RLHF in LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, GPT-4) and the empirical performance of algorithms like PPO in large-scale discrete tasks \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n    *   **Performance Metrics & Comparisons**: The paper implicitly references the improved performance of RLHF over SFT in LLM alignment, attributing it to the theoretical advantages of IL/IRL over BC \\cite{sun2023awe}. It also discusses the practical considerations and observed performance of PPO in the context of LLM fine-tuning.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**: Policy learning in RLHF remains challenging due to the extremely high action dimensionality (large token vocabulary) and the sparsity of feedback (reward only at the end of a generated sequence) \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n    *   **Current Algorithmic Focus**: Current LLM fine-tuning primarily focuses on on-policy policy-based methods like PPO, potentially overlooking the benefits of off-policy or value-based methods, especially for sparse reward problems where techniques like Hindsight Experience Replay could be beneficial \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The analysis primarily focuses on LLM alignment via human feedback but suggests generalizations of the reward modeling insight to other LLM evaluation and optimization tasks \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art**: Provides a foundational RL perspective that clarifies the technical underpinnings of RLHF, which is a cornerstone of modern LLM capabilities \\cite{sun2023awe}.

      "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered wide attention and led to successful products such as ChatGPT and GPT-4. Their proficiency in adhering to instructions and delivering harmless, helpful, and honest (3H) responses can largely be attributed to the technique of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). In this paper, we aim to link the research in conventional RL to RL techniques used in LLM research. Demystify this technique by discussing why, when, and how RL excels. Furthermore, we explore potential future avenues that could either benefit from or contribute to RLHF research. Highlighted Takeaways: 1. RLHF is Online Inverse RL with Offline Demonstration Data. 2. RLHF $>$ SFT because Imitation Learning (and Inverse RL) $>$ Behavior Cloning (BC) by alleviating the problem of compounding error. 3. The RM step in RLHF generates a proxy of the expensive human feedback, such an insight can be generalized to other LLM tasks such as prompting evaluation and optimization where feedback is also expensive. 4. The policy learning in RLHF is more challenging than conventional problems studied in IRL due to their high action dimensionality and feedback sparsity. 5. The main superiority of PPO over off-policy value-based methods is its stability gained from (almost) on-policy data and conservative policy updates.",

It seeks to explain *why, when, and how* RL excels in LLM alignment.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: LLMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4 achieve proficiency in instruction following and generating helpful, harmless, and honest (3H) responses largely due to RLHF. Understanding the underlying RL principles is crucial for further advancements, especially given the high action dimensionality and feedback sparsity in LLM generation tasks \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relationship to Existing Approaches**: The paper positions RLHF within the broader landscape of RL, specifically comparing it to Online RL, Offline RL, Imitation Learning (IL), Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), and Learning from Demonstrations (LfD) \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   **Offline RL**: Suffers from distributional shift and compounding error due to the inability to explore and the static nature of the dataset \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n        *   **Behavior Cloning (BC)** (which Supervised Fine-Tuning, SFT, is analogous to): Prone to compounding errors, where initial mistakes lead to out-of-distribution states and subsequent errors, resulting in a quadratic error bound with trajectory length \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n        *   **Reward Engineering**: Conventional RL often struggles with tasks where defining an explicit, dense reward function is difficult or results in sparse feedback (e.g., \"win/lose\" in Go) \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper argues that RLHF, despite appearing as an Offline RL problem due to the use of offline human preference data, is fundamentally an **Online Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) problem** \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**: The key insight is that the **transition dynamics model in LLM response generation is known** (i.e., the auto-regressive concatenation of tokens) \\cite{sun2023awe}. This allows RLHF to leverage the benefits of Online IL/IRL, which alleviates the compounding error and distributional shift problems inherent in pure Offline RL or Behavior Cloning approaches like SFT \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n    *   **Two-step IRL process**: RLHF explicitly learns a reward model from human preference data (the \"inverse\" part) and then uses this learned reward model with the known dynamics model to perform online RL (e.g., using PPO) \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Conceptual Framework**: Formalizes RLHF as \"Online Inverse RL with Offline Demonstration Data,\" providing a clear theoretical link between LLM alignment techniques and established RL paradigms \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n    *   **Problem Re-framing**: Identifies the known transition dynamics of LLMs as the critical factor that transforms the seemingly offline RL problem of RLHF into an online IL/IRL problem, thereby mitigating common challenges like compounding error and distributional shift \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n    *   **Explanation for RLHF's Superiority**: Provides an RL-centric explanation for why RLHF outperforms SFT: RLHF benefits from IL's ability to access the dynamics model, while SFT is analogous to Behavior Cloning, which suffers from compounding error \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n    *   **Generalizable Insight**: Highlights that the Reward Model (RM) step in RLHF acts as a proxy for expensive human feedback, an insight that can be generalized to other LLM tasks requiring costly feedback evaluation and optimization \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n    *   **Analysis of PPO**: Discusses the empirical superiority of PPO in RLHF, attributing its stability to (almost) on-policy data and conservative policy updates, while also pointing out its challenges in sparse reward settings and high computational demands \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   This paper is a technical perspective and review, not presenting new experimental results. Instead, it analyzes existing practices and findings in the field.\n    *   **Implicit Validation**: The analysis draws upon the observed success of RLHF in LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, GPT-4) and the empirical performance of algorithms like PPO in large-scale discrete tasks \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n    *   **Performance Metrics & Comparisons**: The paper implicitly references the improved performance of RLHF over SFT in LLM alignment, attributing it to the theoretical advantages of IL/IRL over BC \\cite{sun2023awe}. It also discusses the practical considerations and observed performance of PPO in the context of LLM fine-tuning.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**: Policy learning in RLHF remains challenging due to the extremely high action dimensionality (large token vocabulary) and the sparsity of feedback (reward only at the end of a generated sequence) \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n    *   **Current Algorithmic Focus**: Current LLM fine-tuning primarily focuses on on-policy policy-based methods like PPO, potentially overlooking the benefits of off-policy or value-based methods, especially for sparse reward problems where techniques like Hindsight Experience Replay could be beneficial \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The analysis primarily focuses on LLM alignment via human feedback but suggests generalizations of the reward modeling insight to other LLM evaluation and optimization tasks \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art**: Provides a foundational RL perspective that clarifies the technical underpinnings of RLHF, which is a cornerstone of modern LLM capabilities \\cite{sun2023awe}. By re-framing RLHF as Online IRL, it offers a robust theoretical justification for its effectiveness.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n        *   **Algorithm Development**: Opens avenues for exploring alternatives to PPO, including off-policy value-based methods, Hindsight learning, and other ranking-based approaches (e.g., DPO, RRHF, RAFT) to address PPO's limitations in stability, memory, and sparse reward settings \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n        *   **Reward Modeling**: Encourages further research into efficient and generalizable reward modeling techniques, especially for tasks where human feedback is expensive \\cite{sun2023awe}.\n        *   **Theoretical Understanding**: Deepens the theoretical understanding of LLM fine-tuning, guiding the development of more robust and efficient alignment strategies by leveraging established RL theory \\cite{sun2023awe}.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) has the advantages of shorter annotation cycles and lower costs over Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), making it highly efficient during the rapid strategy iteration periods of large language model (LLM) training. Using ChatGPT as a labeler to provide feedback on open-domain prompts in RLAIF training, we observe an increase in human evaluators' preference win ratio for model responses, but a decrease in evaluators' satisfaction rate. Analysis suggests that the decrease in satisfaction rate is mainly due to some responses becoming less helpful, particularly in terms of correctness and truthfulness, highlighting practical limitations of basic RLAIF. In this paper, we propose Hybrid Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (HRLAIF). This method enhances the accuracy of AI annotations for responses, making the model's helpfulness more robust in training process. Additionally, it employs AI for Red Teaming, further improving the model's harmlessness. Human evaluation results show that HRLAIF inherits the ability of RLAIF to enhance human preference for outcomes at a low cost while also improving the satisfaction rate of responses.

      "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a pivotal technique for empowering large language model (LLM) applications. Compared with the supervised training process of LLMs, the RLHF training process is much more sophisticated, requiring a diverse range of computation workloads with intricate dependencies between multiple LLM instances. Therefore, simply adopting the fixed parallelization strategies from supervised training for LLMs can be insufficient for RLHF and result in low training efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel technique named parameter ReaLlocation, which dynamically adapts the parallelization strategies for different workloads during training by redistributing LLM parameters across the training cluster. Building upon this idea, we introduce ReaL, a pioneering system for efficient RLHF training. ReaL introduces the concept of an execution plan, which defines a fine-grained resource allocation and parallelization strategy particularly designed for RLHF training. Based on this concept, ReaL employs a tailored search algorithm with a lightweight run-time estimator to automatically discover an efficient execution plan for an instance of RLHF experiment. Subsequently, the runtime engine deploys the selected plan by effectively parallelizing computations and redistributing parameters. We evaluate ReaL on the LLaMA models with up to 70 billion parameters and 128 GPUs. The experimental results demonstrate that ReaL achieves speedups of up to $3.58\\times$ compared to baseline methods. Furthermore, the execution plans generated by ReaL exhibit an average of $81\\%$ performance improvement over heuristic approaches based on Megatron-LM in the long-context scenario.

    "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** The paper addresses the inefficient and costly process of collecting human pairwise preferences for training reward models in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) \\cite{scheid20244oy}. Existing methods primarily focus on preference optimization *after* data collection, neglecting the crucial initial step of dataset construction.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge:** Human labeling is expensive and time-consuming. Suboptimal dataset selection leads to a loss of valuable information and reduces the effectiveness of subsequent reward model training and policy alignment. The challenge lies in theoretically grounding and optimizing this data collection process to minimize the number of samples needed while maximizing the information gained.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** The majority of RLHF literature focuses on preference optimization procedures (e.g., PPO, DPO) for fine-tuning language models with a given preference dataset \\cite{scheid20244oy}. This work explicitly contrasts with these by shifting focus to the *data collection* phase.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:** Current dataset selection often relies on heuristics or black-box methods, lacking provable bounds on optimality. There's a gap in theoretical understanding of how to efficiently construct human preference datasets, which this paper aims to fill.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper formalizes the reward training model in RLHF as a pure exploration bandit framework, specifically a linear contextual dueling bandit problem, aimed at simple regret minimization \\cite{scheid20244oy}.

      "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a popular approach to align language models (LMs) with human preferences. This method involves collecting a large dataset of human pairwise preferences across various text generations and using it to infer (implicitly or explicitly) a reward model. Numerous methods have been proposed to learn the reward model and align a LM with it. However, the costly process of collecting human preferences has received little attention and could benefit from theoretical insights. This paper addresses this issue and aims to formalize the reward training model in RLHF. We frame the selection of an effective dataset as a simple regret minimization task, using a linear contextual dueling bandit method. Given the potentially large number of arms, this approach is more coherent than the best-arm identification setting. We then propose an offline framework for solving this problem. Under appropriate assumptions - linearity of the reward model in the embedding space, and boundedness of the reward parameter - we derive bounds on the simple regret. Finally, we provide a lower bound that matches our upper bound up to constant and logarithmic terms. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical contribution in this area to provide an offline approach as well as worst-case guarantees.",

      "abstract": "Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) based on human preferences, commonly achieved through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), has been effective in improving their performance. However, maintaining LLM safety throughout the fine-tuning process remains a significant challenge, as resolving conflicts between safety and helpfulness can be non-trivial. Typically, the safety alignment of LLM is trained on data with safety-related categories. However, our experiments find that naively increasing the scale of safety training data usually leads the LLMs to an ``overly safe'' state rather than a ``truly safe'' state, boosting the refusal rate through extensive safety-aligned data without genuinely understanding the requirements for safe responses. Such an approach can inadvertently diminish the models' helpfulness. To understand the phenomenon, we first investigate the role of safety data by categorizing them into three different groups, and observe that each group behaves differently as training data scales up. To boost the balance between safety and helpfulness, we propose an Equilibrate RLHF framework including a Fine-grained Data-centric (FDC) approach that achieves better safety alignment even with fewer training data, and an Adaptive Message-wise Alignment (AMA) approach, which selectively highlight the key segments through a gradient masking strategy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the safety alignment of LLMs while balancing safety and helpfulness.",

It also relates to multi-objective RLHF, re-parameterized RL objectives, and methods focusing on psychological techniques or red teaming for safety \\cite{tan2025lk0}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   Traditional human-guided methods (SFT, RLHF) face scalability and efficiency limitations due to heavy reliance on human annotation \\cite{tan2025lk0}.\n        *   Automated techniques (e.g., rule-based rewards, generation-aware alignment) exist but do not specifically address the *quality and type* of safety data \\cite{tan2025lk0}.\n        *   Crucially, previous works have largely *overlooked the role of safety data* in achieving the helpfulness-safety trade-off, failing to analyze how different types and quantities of safety data impact alignment \\cite{tan2025lk0}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes the \"Equilibrate RLHF\" framework, which includes two main components:\n        *   **Fine-grained Data-centric (FDC) approach**: This involves categorizing safety data into three distinct groups—Explicit Harmful Data (EHD), Implicit Harmful Data (IHD), and Mixed Risk Data (MHD)—to understand their differential impact on safety alignment as training data scales \\cite{tan2025lk0}.

    "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review, emphasizing technical innovations and empirical validation:\n\n### Focused Summary for Literature Review\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Current Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) frameworks for Large Language Model (LLM) alignment face two key issues:\n        1.  **Reward Model (RM) Calibration**: Traditional RMs often use Bradley-Terry models to convert pairwise human preferences into scalar rewards. These scalar rewards frequently lack consistent calibration across diverse prompt-response contexts, leading to unstable training dynamics and suboptimal alignment \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n        2.  **Architectural Mismatch in RM Initialization**: RMs are typically initialized from generative foundation models (e.g., pre-trained or supervised fine-tuned LLMs), despite performing a discriminative task (ranking outputs). This mismatch hinders the RM's ability to accurately capture human preferences and propagates errors to the subsequent RL stage \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: Aligning LLMs with human values and preferences (ensuring safety, helpfulness, and contextual appropriateness) is a critical post-training challenge. The aforementioned limitations make this alignment process unstable, inefficient, and prone to suboptimal outcomes \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**:\n        *   **Pairwise Reward Models**: Builds upon the concept of pairwise generative reward models, which process response pairs in a shared context, but introduces specific techniques for calibration and position bias mitigation \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n        *   **Pairwise Reinforcement Learning**: Differs from methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) \\cite{xu2025iv8} and P3O \\cite{xu2025iv8} by treating individual tokens as actors rather than the whole trajectory as a single actor. This avoids the sparse reward and low sample efficiency issues associated with trajectory-wise approaches \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n        *   **Reward Shaping**: Extends ideas from Preference As Reward (PAR) \\cite{xu2025iv8} and Robust RLHF \\cite{xu2025iv8} by integrating a baseline (ground-truth anchor) directly into the reward calculation and policy optimization, rather than just for reward shaping or contrastive rewards \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   **Traditional Bradley-Terry RMs**: Suffer from poor calibration and sensitivity to distributional shifts \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n        *   **Generative RMs (CoT-based)**: Can introduce variability due to the stochastic nature of Chain of Thought generation \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n        *   **DPO/P3O**: Treat language generation as a Contextual Bandit problem, leading to overly sparse rewards, difficulty in credit assignment for individual tokens, and low sample efficiency \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: Pairwise-RL is a unified RLHF framework that addresses the identified challenges by consistently applying a pairwise paradigm to both reward model training and policy optimization \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n        *   **Pairwise Reward Model (RM)**:\n            *   Designed to perform relative judgments between a generated response and a ground-truth anchor, simplifying the task from absolute scoring to relative comparison \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n            *   Leverages generative modeling by framing the comparison as a natural language understanding task (e.g., \"Is y\\* better than y? Answer yes or no.\") to utilize the LLM's contextual understanding \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n            *   Mitigates **position bias** through data augmentation (swapping response order in input) and an MSE-based constraint (`Lpos`) that penalizes asymmetric judgments when comparison order is reversed \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n        *   **Pairwise Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**:\n            *   Redefines the RL objective to maximize the *win probability* of the generated response `y` over the ground-truth anchor `y*`, directly operating on pairwise comparisons \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n            *   Calculates the reward `r(y|y*, q)` by averaging symmetric evaluations (`p(yes|q, y≻y*) + p(no|q, y*≻y)`), which mitigates \"yes/no\" prediction bias and reduces variance \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n            *   Introduces an **implicit weighting mechanism**: the sigmoid transformation of win probabilities saturates for large reward differences, reducing the learning signal for already superior responses and amplifying it for closely matched ones. This helps mitigate \"reward hacking\" \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n            *   Addresses **value function alignment** by distilling a *pointwise discriminative reward model* from the pairwise generative RM using MSE loss. This distilled pointwise RM is used for value estimation, while the original pairwise RM is used for advantage calculation, resolving the inconsistency of `y*` availability during policy sampling \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n    *   **Novelty**: The unification of generative reward modeling and pairwise PPO within a consistent framework is novel. The specific techniques for mitigating position bias in the RM and the dynamic weighting mechanism in PPO via sigmoid saturation are key innovations. The strategy for aligning value function learning in a pairwise context by distilling a pointwise RM for value estimation is also a significant technical contribution \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   A unified Pairwise-RL framework that integrates generative reward modeling and a novel pairwise policy optimization algorithm \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n    *   A pairwise PPO algorithm that directly operates on win probabilities derived from pairwise comparisons, bypassing the limitations of scalar reward approximations \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n    *   A generative reward model design that frames preference as a natural language understanding task, enhanced with data augmentation and an MSE-based positional consistency constraint (`Lpos`) to mitigate position bias and improve calibration \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n    *   A robust reward calculation method for pairwise PPO that averages symmetric evaluations to reduce bias and variance in win probability estimation \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n    *   An implicit weighting mechanism in pairwise PPO, achieved through sigmoid saturation of win probabilities, which dynamically adjusts learning signals to mitigate \"reward hacking\" \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n    *   A novel strategy for value function alignment in pairwise RL, involving the distillation of a pointwise reward model for value estimation while retaining the pairwise reward model for advantage calculation \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**:\n        *   Comparison of the pairwise reward model against traditional pointwise RMs.\n        *   End-to-end evaluation of Pairwise PPO against standard PPO \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n        *   Ablation studies on smaller in-house models to isolate component contributions \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n    *   **Datasets**:\n        *   Internal Chinese dataset (in-domain IID responses).\n        *   External dataset (out-of-distribution prompts annotated via internal rules).\n        *   Reward Bench dataset.\n        *   For end-to-end PPO evaluation: a comprehensive internal dataset covering seven capabilities (reasoning, planning, instruction following, STEM, coding, knowledge, fundamental NLP, long text processing) and external public benchmarks (MMLU pro, CEval, KORBench, BBH, MATH, LiveCodeBench, IFEval, GPQA) \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Pairwise-RL consistently **outperforms traditional RLHF frameworks** \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n        *   Achieves **better alignment with human preferences** \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n        *   Shows **improved model behavior** across a range of tasks on both internal evaluation datasets and standard public benchmarks \\cite{xu2025iv8}. (Specific quantitative improvements are not detailed in the provided abstract/introduction but are claimed.)\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The paper notes that the `ζ` parameter in the `Lpos` loss is kept \"relatively small to preserve some difference between different response positions,\" suggesting a potential sensitivity or trade-off in balancing classification accuracy and positional consistency \\cite{xu2025iv8}. The initial attempt at \"Value w/ GT\" for value estimation was found problematic due to state inconsistency, highlighting the complexity of value function alignment in pairwise settings \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The framework is primarily designed for aligning large language models with human preferences during post-training, particularly in scenarios where robust preference learning and stable RL training are crucial \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art**: Pairwise-RL significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in RLHF by providing a more robust and unified framework that directly addresses the critical issues of reward model calibration and the architectural mismatch between generative initialization and discriminative tasks \\cite{xu2025iv8}. It offers a principled way to leverage generative capabilities for discriminative preference learning and to perform policy optimization directly on pairwise signals \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: This work could inspire future research into unified pairwise learning paradigms for other machine learning tasks. It provides a strong foundation for developing more stable, efficient, and human-aligned LLMs, potentially leading to breakthroughs in areas requiring nuanced understanding of human preferences and complex decision-making \\cite{xu2025iv8}.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a important paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences during post-training. This framework typically involves two stages: first, training a reward model on human preference data, followed by optimizing the language model using reinforcement learning algorithms. However, current RLHF approaches may constrained by two limitations. First, existing RLHF frameworks often rely on Bradley-Terry models to assign scalar rewards based on pairwise comparisons of individual responses. However, this approach imposes significant challenges on reward model (RM), as the inherent variability in prompt-response pairs across different contexts demands robust calibration capabilities from the RM. Second, reward models are typically initialized from generative foundation models, such as pre-trained or supervised fine-tuned models, despite the fact that reward models perform discriminative tasks, creating a mismatch. This paper introduces Pairwise-RL, a RLHF framework that addresses these challenges through a combination of generative reward modeling and a pairwise proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. Pairwise-RL unifies reward model training and its application during reinforcement learning within a consistent pairwise paradigm, leveraging generative modeling techniques to enhance reward model performance and score calibration. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Pairwise-RL outperforms traditional RLHF frameworks across both internal evaluation datasets and standard public benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in improving alignment and model behavior.",

These scalar rewards frequently lack consistent calibration across diverse prompt-response contexts, leading to unstable training dynamics and suboptimal alignment \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n        2.  **Architectural Mismatch in RM Initialization**: RMs are typically initialized from generative foundation models (e.g., pre-trained or supervised fine-tuned LLMs), despite performing a discriminative task (ranking outputs). This mismatch hinders the RM's ability to accurately capture human preferences and propagates errors to the subsequent RL stage \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: Aligning LLMs with human values and preferences (ensuring safety, helpfulness, and contextual appropriateness) is a critical post-training challenge. The aforementioned limitations make this alignment process unstable, inefficient, and prone to suboptimal outcomes \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**:\n        *   **Pairwise Reward Models**: Builds upon the concept of pairwise generative reward models, which process response pairs in a shared context, but introduces specific techniques for calibration and position bias mitigation \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n        *   **Pairwise Reinforcement Learning**: Differs from methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) \\cite{xu2025iv8} and P3O \\cite{xu2025iv8} by treating individual tokens as actors rather than the whole trajectory as a single actor. This avoids the sparse reward and low sample efficiency issues associated with trajectory-wise approaches \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n        *   **Reward Shaping**: Extends ideas from Preference As Reward (PAR) \\cite{xu2025iv8} and Robust RLHF \\cite{xu2025iv8} by integrating a baseline (ground-truth anchor) directly into the reward calculation and policy optimization, rather than just for reward shaping or contrastive rewards \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   **Traditional Bradley-Terry RMs**: Suffer from poor calibration and sensitivity to distributional shifts \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n        *   **Generative RMs (CoT-based)**: Can introduce variability due to the stochastic nature of Chain of Thought generation \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n        *   **DPO/P3O**: Treat language generation as a Contextual Bandit problem, leading to overly sparse rewards, difficulty in credit assignment for individual tokens, and low sample efficiency \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: Pairwise-RL is a unified RLHF framework that addresses the identified challenges by consistently applying a pairwise paradigm to both reward model training and policy optimization \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n        *   **Pairwise Reward Model (RM)**:\n            *   Designed to perform relative judgments between a generated response and a ground-truth anchor, simplifying the task from absolute scoring to relative comparison \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n            *   Leverages generative modeling by framing the comparison as a natural language understanding task (e.g., \"Is y\\* better than y? Answer yes or no.\") to utilize the LLM's contextual understanding \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n            *   Mitigates **position bias** through data augmentation (swapping response order in input) and an MSE-based constraint (`Lpos`) that penalizes asymmetric judgments when comparison order is reversed \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n        *   **Pairwise Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**:\n            *   Redefines the RL objective to maximize the *win probability* of the generated response `y` over the ground-truth anchor `y*`, directly operating on pairwise comparisons \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n            *   Calculates the reward `r(y|y*, q)` by averaging symmetric evaluations (`p(yes|q, y≻y*) + p(no|q, y*≻y)`), which mitigates \"yes/no\" prediction bias and reduces variance \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n            *   Introduces an **implicit weighting mechanism**: the sigmoid transformation of win probabilities saturates for large reward differences, reducing the learning signal for already superior responses and amplifying it for closely matched ones. This helps mitigate \"reward hacking\" \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n            *   Addresses **value function alignment** by distilling a *pointwise discriminative reward model* from the pairwise generative RM using MSE loss. This distilled pointwise RM is used for value estimation, while the original pairwise RM is used for advantage calculation, resolving the inconsistency of `y*` availability during policy sampling \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n    *   **Novelty**: The unification of generative reward modeling and pairwise PPO within a consistent framework is novel. The specific techniques for mitigating position bias in the RM and the dynamic weighting mechanism in PPO via sigmoid saturation are key innovations. The strategy for aligning value function learning in a pairwise context by distilling a pointwise RM for value estimation is also a significant technical contribution \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   A unified Pairwise-RL framework that integrates generative reward modeling and a novel pairwise policy optimization algorithm \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n    *   A pairwise PPO algorithm that directly operates on win probabilities derived from pairwise comparisons, bypassing the limitations of scalar reward approximations \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n    *   A generative reward model design that frames preference as a natural language understanding task, enhanced with data augmentation and an MSE-based positional consistency constraint (`Lpos`) to mitigate position bias and improve calibration \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n    *   A robust reward calculation method for pairwise PPO that averages symmetric evaluations to reduce bias and variance in win probability estimation \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n    *   An implicit weighting mechanism in pairwise PPO, achieved through sigmoid saturation of win probabilities, which dynamically adjusts learning signals to mitigate \"reward hacking\" \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n    *   A novel strategy for value function alignment in pairwise RL, involving the distillation of a pointwise reward model for value estimation while retaining the pairwise reward model for advantage calculation \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**:\n        *   Comparison of the pairwise reward model against traditional pointwise RMs.\n        *   End-to-end evaluation of Pairwise PPO against standard PPO \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n        *   Ablation studies on smaller in-house models to isolate component contributions \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n    *   **Datasets**:\n        *   Internal Chinese dataset (in-domain IID responses).\n        *   External dataset (out-of-distribution prompts annotated via internal rules).\n        *   Reward Bench dataset.\n        *   For end-to-end PPO evaluation: a comprehensive internal dataset covering seven capabilities (reasoning, planning, instruction following, STEM, coding, knowledge, fundamental NLP, long text processing) and external public benchmarks (MMLU pro, CEval, KORBench, BBH, MATH, LiveCodeBench, IFEval, GPQA) \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Pairwise-RL consistently **outperforms traditional RLHF frameworks** \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n        *   Achieves **better alignment with human preferences** \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n        *   Shows **improved model behavior** across a range of tasks on both internal evaluation datasets and standard public benchmarks \\cite{xu2025iv8}. (Specific quantitative improvements are not detailed in the provided abstract/introduction but are claimed.)\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The paper notes that the `ζ` parameter in the `Lpos` loss is kept \"relatively small to preserve some difference between different response positions,\" suggesting a potential sensitivity or trade-off in balancing classification accuracy and positional consistency \\cite{xu2025iv8}. The initial attempt at \"Value w/ GT\" for value estimation was found problematic due to state inconsistency, highlighting the complexity of value function alignment in pairwise settings \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The framework is primarily designed for aligning large language models with human preferences during post-training, particularly in scenarios where robust preference learning and stable RL training are crucial \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art**: Pairwise-RL significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in RLHF by providing a more robust and unified framework that directly addresses the critical issues of reward model calibration and the architectural mismatch between generative initialization and discriminative tasks \\cite{xu2025iv8}. It offers a principled way to leverage generative capabilities for discriminative preference learning and to perform policy optimization directly on pairwise signals \\cite{xu2025iv8}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: This work could inspire future research into unified pairwise learning paradigms for other machine learning tasks. It provides a strong foundation for developing more stable, efficient, and human-aligned LLMs, potentially leading to breakthroughs in areas requiring nuanced understanding of human preferences and complex decision-making \\cite{xu2025iv8}.",

SFT is prone to overfitting and relies heavily on high-quality Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations, while RL suffers from reward hacking and mode collapse, potentially eroding acquired reasoning skills.\n    *   **Challenge:** Hybrid SFT-RL approaches exist (e.g., static two-stage schedules) but often yield poor cross-task generalization, especially when high-quality data is scarce. There's a critical \"forget-stagnation trade-off\": RL's exploration can lead to catastrophic forgetting of basic skills, while excessive SFT causes stagnation and poor generalization to novel tasks.\n    *   **Motivation:** To develop a more robust and adaptive training paradigm that dynamically balances the benefits of SFT (internalizing fixed patterns, stability) and RL (exploration, transferable decision-making, generalization) for task-specific LLMs, inspired by human curriculum learning.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches:**\n        *   **Pure SFT:** Effective for adapting pre-trained models to downstream tasks with high-quality data, but susceptible to overfitting and struggles with open-ended tasks \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n        *   **Pure RL (e.g., PPO, GRPO):** Refines LLMs through reward-driven optimization, enhancing capabilities like mathematical reasoning (GRPO). However, it's prone to reward hacking and pattern/mode collapse \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n        *   **Static Hybrid Approaches (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, ReFT):** Combine SFT and RL, often in a fixed, multi-stage schedule (e.g., SFT then RL). These show superior performance over pure methods but lack dynamic adaptation to evolving training states and struggle with progressive capability transfer, leading to suboptimal generalization \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:** Static schedules cannot adapt to varying optimal warm-up durations or switching points across tasks, and hard switches between paradigms can negatively impact learning by causing abrupt shifts \\cite{chen2025fs9}. Auxiliary techniques (entropy bonuses, curriculum learning, PTX loss) are often confined to a single paradigm, failing to address fundamental weaknesses of hybrid integration \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Method (SASR):** A step-wise adaptive hybrid training framework that theoretically unifies SFT and RL, dynamically balancing their contributions throughout optimization \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n    *   **Two Phases:**\n        1.  **SFT Warm-up:** Initializes the model with basic reasoning skills by fine-tuning on a small-scale dataset of (question, chain-of-thought) pairs, minimizing negative log-likelihood loss \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n        2.  **Adaptive Hybrid Training:** Seamlessly integrates SFT with the online RL method GRPO. The overall loss function is a dynamic combination: `L(θ) = (1-I(t)) * LSFT(θ) + I(t) * LGRPO(θ)`, where `I(t)` is a state function determining the paradigm decision at each training step \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n    *   **Dynamic Ratio Selection:** A novel gradient-norm-based adaptive mechanism continuously monitors the model's training status. It computes a probability `p` based on the current SFT gradient norm (`Glast-SFT`) and the SFT gradient norm recorded at the end of the warm-up phase (`Gwarmup`). This `p` value dynamically adjusts the ratio of SFT to GRPO, allowing for smooth transitions between exploration-dominant (more SFT when far from data distribution) and exploitation-dominant (more GRPO when close to data distribution) phases \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n    *   **Theoretical Foundation:** The paper establishes a fundamental relationship: `||∇θLSFT|| = ||∇θDKL(πdata || πθ)||`, showing that minimizing SFT loss reduces the discrepancy between the model policy and the data distribution. This allows the gradient norm to serve as a monitor for policy deviation \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Framework:** SASR is presented as the first adaptive dynamic training framework that theoretically unifies SFT and RL, demonstrating the superiority of smooth, data-driven hybrid training \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n    *   **Adaptive Switching Indicator:** A dynamic switching indicator is designed, leveraging the relationship between warm-up gradient norms and current training states to resolve the \"forget-stagnation trade-off\" \\cite{chen2025fs9}. This mechanism ensures progressive capability gains while safeguarding core reasoning skills.\n    *   **Theoretical Insight:** Formalizes the relationship between SFT loss gradient norm and KL divergence to the data distribution, providing a monitorable optimization objective for balancing stability and exploration \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n    *   **System Design:** Introduces a step-wise adaptive mechanism that operates at the granularity of a single training step, enabling more flexible and precise adjustments compared to epoch-level static schedules \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments:** Extensive experiments were conducted on two base LLMs (DeepSeek and Qwen) \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n    *   **Datasets:** Evaluated across three standard datasets: GSM8K (mathematical calculation), MATH (more challenging mathematical reasoning), and Knight-and-Knives (KK) (logic-based question answering) \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n    *   **Performance Metrics:** Absolute accuracy \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n    *   **Comparison Results:**\n        *   SASR significantly outperforms pure SFT, pure RL, and static hybrid training methods \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n        *   On mathematical reasoning tasks (GSM8K), SASR achieved an absolute accuracy improvement of 12.45% over SFT and 15.30% over RL \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n        *   On the more challenging MATH and KK datasets, SASR surpassed static hybrid baselines by an average of 8.0% \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n        *   Visualizations (Figure 3) show smoother gradient norm transitions for SASR compared to SFT+GRPO, and (Figure 4) demonstrate its ability to adapt the SFT/RL ratio differently across various tasks \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Scope:** The framework is primarily validated for mathematical reasoning and logical inference tasks, particularly in scenarios where high-quality, large-scale datasets might be unavailable for task-specific LLMs \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n    *   **Assumptions:** The approach assumes the availability of a small-scale dataset of (question, chain-of-thought) pairs for the initial SFT warm-up \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n    *   **Technical Limitations (Implicit):** While the paper addresses limitations of prior methods, it does not explicitly state specific technical limitations of SASR itself, such as computational overhead of gradient norm monitoring or potential hyperparameter sensitivity of the `γ` parameter in the dynamic ratio selection.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement:** SASR advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing a principled, adaptive mechanism to integrate SFT and RL, overcoming the limitations of static hybrid approaches and the \"forget-stagnation trade-off\" \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n    *   **Impact:** It offers a robust framework for fine-tuning LLMs for specialized tasks, especially those lacking extensive high-quality data, by dynamically balancing stability and exploration. This can lead to more generalized and less brittle task-specific LLMs \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n    *   **Future Research:** The theoretical unification of SFT and RL through gradient norm monitoring opens new avenues for research into dynamic training paradigms, potentially inspiring similar adaptive strategies for other complex model training scenarios \\cite{chen2025fs9}.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) excel at mathematical reasoning and logical problem-solving. The current popular training paradigms primarily use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the models'reasoning abilities. However, when using SFT or RL alone, there are respective challenges: SFT may suffer from overfitting, while RL is prone to mode collapse. The state-of-the-art methods have proposed hybrid training schemes. However, static switching faces challenges such as poor generalization across different tasks and high dependence on data quality. In response to these challenges, inspired by the curriculum learning-quiz mechanism in human reasoning cultivation, We propose SASR, a step-wise adaptive hybrid training framework that theoretically unifies SFT and RL and dynamically balances the two throughout optimization. SASR uses SFT for initial warm-up to establish basic reasoning skills, and then uses an adaptive dynamic adjustment algorithm based on gradient norm and divergence relative to the original distribution to seamlessly integrate SFT with the online RL method GRPO. By monitoring the training status of LLMs and adjusting the training process in sequence, SASR ensures a smooth transition between training schemes, maintaining core reasoning abilities while exploring different paths. Experimental results demonstrate that SASR outperforms SFT, RL, and static hybrid training methods.",

This mechanism ensures progressive capability gains while safeguarding core reasoning skills.\n    *   **Theoretical Insight:** Formalizes the relationship between SFT loss gradient norm and KL divergence to the data distribution, providing a monitorable optimization objective for balancing stability and exploration \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n    *   **System Design:** Introduces a step-wise adaptive mechanism that operates at the granularity of a single training step, enabling more flexible and precise adjustments compared to epoch-level static schedules \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments:** Extensive experiments were conducted on two base LLMs (DeepSeek and Qwen) \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n    *   **Datasets:** Evaluated across three standard datasets: GSM8K (mathematical calculation), MATH (more challenging mathematical reasoning), and Knight-and-Knives (KK) (logic-based question answering) \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n    *   **Performance Metrics:** Absolute accuracy \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n    *   **Comparison Results:**\n        *   SASR significantly outperforms pure SFT, pure RL, and static hybrid training methods \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n        *   On mathematical reasoning tasks (GSM8K), SASR achieved an absolute accuracy improvement of 12.45% over SFT and 15.30% over RL \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n        *   On the more challenging MATH and KK datasets, SASR surpassed static hybrid baselines by an average of 8.0% \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n        *   Visualizations (Figure 3) show smoother gradient norm transitions for SASR compared to SFT+GRPO, and (Figure 4) demonstrate its ability to adapt the SFT/RL ratio differently across various tasks \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Scope:** The framework is primarily validated for mathematical reasoning and logical inference tasks, particularly in scenarios where high-quality, large-scale datasets might be unavailable for task-specific LLMs \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n    *   **Assumptions:** The approach assumes the availability of a small-scale dataset of (question, chain-of-thought) pairs for the initial SFT warm-up \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n    *   **Technical Limitations (Implicit):** While the paper addresses limitations of prior methods, it does not explicitly state specific technical limitations of SASR itself, such as computational overhead of gradient norm monitoring or potential hyperparameter sensitivity of the `γ` parameter in the dynamic ratio selection.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement:** SASR advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing a principled, adaptive mechanism to integrate SFT and RL, overcoming the limitations of static hybrid approaches and the \"forget-stagnation trade-off\" \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n    *   **Impact:** It offers a robust framework for fine-tuning LLMs for specialized tasks, especially those lacking extensive high-quality data, by dynamically balancing stability and exploration. This can lead to more generalized and less brittle task-specific LLMs \\cite{chen2025fs9}.\n    *   **Future Research:** The theoretical unification of SFT and RL through gradient norm monitoring opens new avenues for research into dynamic training paradigms, potentially inspiring similar adaptive strategies for other complex model training scenarios \\cite{chen2025fs9}.",

Traditional RLHF methods, particularly those based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are complex, require extensive hyper-parameter tuning, and suffer from issues in sample efficiency and stability.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: Aligning LLMs with human preferences (e.g., for helpfulness, harmlessness) is crucial for their safe and effective deployment (e.g., ChatGPT, Llama3). The complexity and resource demands of existing RLHF methods, especially the need for extensive human preference data and additional reward/value models, make them challenging to apply, particularly in low-resource settings. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offers efficiency but operates at the sequence level, lacking token-level granularity and still requiring preference data.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**:\n        *   **RLHF (PPO)**: Inverse-Q* aims to achieve similar sample utilization efficiency and supervision granularity as PPO but without its complexity, instability, and reliance on reward/value models.\n        *   **DPO**: Inverse-Q* leverages direct preference optimization *techniques* but extends them. While DPO optimizes preference reward loss directly at the sequence level, Inverse-Q* is framed as an \"inverse problem of DPO training\" that generalizes to token-level decisions.\n        *   **Credit Assignment**: Similar to methods like ABC, RTO, and r2Q* that explore token-level reward assignment, Inverse-Q* provides token-level RL training. However, it does so without requiring pre-labeled preference data or explicit reward/value models, unlike r2Q* which needed pre-labeled data for reference distribution.\n        *   **Self-Improvement**: Inverse-Q* can be viewed as a self-improvement approach, but it distinguishes itself by not relying on external feedback or an additional trained reward model to define the optimal strategy. Instead, it optimizes based on the model's *own estimation* of the optimal strategy.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   PPO's high performance depends on complex optimization, hyper-parameter tuning, and suffers from sample inefficiency and stability issues. It also requires a reward model and a critic (value) model.\n        *   DPO and similar direct optimization methods (RSO, ReST, ReST-em) still require additional supervisory signals (e.g., a reward model) and primarily operate at the sequence level, lacking natural generalization to token-level process supervision due to the need for full response logits for differentiability.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: Inverse-Q* introduces a novel framework that optimizes token-level reinforcement learning without the need for additional reward or value models.

The effectiveness of Inverse-Q* is implicitly dependent on the ability to obtain or construct such a `πw` that genuinely represents a superior policy. If `πw` is not truly superior or well-defined, the alignment process might be suboptimal.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: Inverse-Q* is particularly suitable for \"low-resource settings\" where obtaining extensive human preference annotations or training additional reward/value models is challenging. It is designed for aligning LLMs in tasks requiring helpfulness and harmlessness.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: Inverse-Q* advances the technical state-of-the-art by offering a novel, more efficient, and robust alternative to conventional RLHF approaches.

Traditional RLHF methods, particularly those based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are complex, require extensive hyper-parameter tuning, and suffer from issues in sample efficiency and stability.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: Aligning LLMs with human preferences (e.g., for helpfulness, harmlessness) is crucial for their safe and effective deployment (e.g., ChatGPT, Llama3). The complexity and resource demands of existing RLHF methods, especially the need for extensive human preference data and additional reward/value models, make them challenging to apply, particularly in low-resource settings. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offers efficiency but operates at the sequence level, lacking token-level granularity and still requiring preference data.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**:\n        *   **RLHF (PPO)**: Inverse-Q* aims to achieve similar sample utilization efficiency and supervision granularity as PPO but without its complexity, instability, and reliance on reward/value models.\n        *   **DPO**: Inverse-Q* leverages direct preference optimization *techniques* but extends them. While DPO optimizes preference reward loss directly at the sequence level, Inverse-Q* is framed as an \"inverse problem of DPO training\" that generalizes to token-level decisions.\n        *   **Credit Assignment**: Similar to methods like ABC, RTO, and r2Q* that explore token-level reward assignment, Inverse-Q* provides token-level RL training. However, it does so without requiring pre-labeled preference data or explicit reward/value models, unlike r2Q* which needed pre-labeled data for reference distribution.\n        *   **Self-Improvement**: Inverse-Q* can be viewed as a self-improvement approach, but it distinguishes itself by not relying on external feedback or an additional trained reward model to define the optimal strategy. Instead, it optimizes based on the model's *own estimation* of the optimal strategy.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   PPO's high performance depends on complex optimization, hyper-parameter tuning, and suffers from sample inefficiency and stability issues. It also requires a reward model and a critic (value) model.\n        *   DPO and similar direct optimization methods (RSO, ReST, ReST-em) still require additional supervisory signals (e.g., a reward model) and primarily operate at the sequence level, lacking natural generalization to token-level process supervision due to the need for full response logits for differentiability.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: Inverse-Q* introduces a novel framework that optimizes token-level reinforcement learning without the need for additional reward or value models.

This restrictive assumption limits the flexibility of the learned reward function, hindering its ability to produce versatile rewards essential for effective downstream policy optimization.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n        *   **Standard BT Model/Cross-Entropy Loss:** Assumes linear scaling of preference logit with reward difference, which is inflexible and insufficient for varying preference strengths.\n        *   **Other Loss Functions (e.g., Song et al., Zhao et al.):** Some require *a priori knowledge* of preference ambiguity (extra labeling) or *limit the range* of learnable reward differences (e.g., hinge loss with zero gradient beyond a margin).\n        *   **Adaptive Temperature Scaling (ATS):** While also using instance-specific scalars, ATS is for confidence calibration, and its scaling parameter interpretation is *opposite* to `\\cite{hong2024mqe}`'s approach (ATS uses larger scaling for higher uncertainty, `\\cite{hong2024mqe}` for *clearer* preferences). ATS often requires additional networks or heuristic designs.\n        *   **Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO):** `\\cite{hong2024mqe}` is inspired by KL-constrained DRO but differs by applying a *separate KL constraint to each individual training data instance* (binary preference comparison) rather than a single constraint for the entire dataset, allowing for efficient, deterministic optimization.\n    *   **Positioning:** `\\cite{hong2024mqe}` offers a more broadly applicable solution that does not require additional labeling, does not sacrifice the ability to learn arbitrarily large reward differences, and provides a principled framework for learning adaptive scaling factors without complex auxiliary networks.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** `\\cite{hong2024mqe}` proposes a novel *adaptive preference loss function* inspired by Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO). This loss incorporates an *instance-specific scaling parameter* ($\\tau_i$) for each pair of trajectory segments.\n    *   **Novelty:**\n        *   **Adaptive Scaling:** The method learns these scaling parameters during training. It assigns *small scaling parameters* to pairs with ambiguous preferences (high uncertainty), leading to more comparable rewards, and *large scaling parameters* to pairs with clear preferences (low uncertainty), resulting in more distinct rewards. This implicitly makes the scaling between the preference distribution logit and the reward difference non-linear.\n        *   **DRO-based Derivation:** The adaptive loss is derived from a KL-constrained DRO formulation, providing a principled framework for learning the scaling factors.\n        *   **Computational Efficiency:** The proposed loss function is strictly convex and univariate with respect to each scaling parameter $\\tau_i$, enabling its efficient optimization through a simple second-order algorithm (projected Newton method) within a few iterations.\n        *   **Versatility:** The approach is generalizable and can be readily adapted to various preference optimization frameworks, including Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Adaptive Preference Loss Function:** Introduces an instance-specific scaling factor ($\\tau_i$) into the preference loss, derived from DRO, to enhance the flexibility of the reward model by adaptively adjusting the relationship between preference strength and reward difference.\n    *   **Efficient Optimization Algorithm:** Develops an efficient projected Newton method for optimizing the instance-specific scaling parameters, leveraging the strict convexity and univariate nature of the loss with respect to each $\\tau_i$.\n    *   **Theoretical Insight:** Provides a proposition demonstrating that the optimal scaling factor $\\tau^*$ adapts to the preference uncertainty, being small for ambiguous preferences and large for clear preferences.\n    *   **Improved Reward-Policy Alignment:** Identifies and provides a principal approach to mitigate the critical misalignment issue where reward models with high preference prediction accuracy often yield suboptimal downstream policies, simplifying the RLHF tuning process.\n    *   **Extension to DPO:** Demonstrates the method's generality by successfully integrating adaptive preference scaling into the DPO framework.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:**\n        *   Robotic control tasks using MuJoCo environments.\n        *   Natural language generation (NLG) tasks with Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Llama-2 7B, and proprietary models like Claude 2 as judges.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics:** Policy performance (e.g., task-specific rewards, generation quality) and the alignment between reward model selection (based on preference prediction accuracy) and downstream policy performance.\n    *   **Comparison Results:**\n        *   **Improved Policy Performance:** `\\cite{hong2024mqe}` consistently improves policy performance on both robotic control and natural language generation tasks compared to baselines.\n        *   **Enhanced Alignment:** The method significantly mitigates the misalignment between reward model selection and policy optimization. This means that selecting a reward model based solely on preference prediction accuracy (a simpler approach) yields a reasonably well-performing policy, reducing the need for computationally expensive joint tuning of reward and policy stages.\n        *   **DPO Integration Benefits:** When integrated with DPO, adaptive preference scaling boosts policy performance in NLG, particularly in scenarios where policy selection must rely solely on preference accuracy due to the high cost of LLM-based assessment.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations:** The theoretical analysis relies on the assumption of knowing the true preference distribution `p*`, which is not available in practice. The method introduces two new hyperparameters (`τ_0`, `τ_max`) for the bounds of the scaling factor, although the paper argues it simplifies overall tuning.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The method is designed for RLHF settings where human preferences are provided as pairwise rankings. It is shown to be applicable to both traditional reward modeling and direct policy optimization (DPO) paradigms across diverse domains like robotic control and LLM-based natural language generation.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art:** `\\cite{hong2024mqe}` significantly advances RLHF reward modeling by introducing a principled way to capture varying preference strengths, moving beyond the limitations of linear scaling assumptions in existing methods.\n    *   **Streamlines RLHF Workflow:** By improving the alignment between reward model selection and policy optimization, it addresses a major practical challenge in RLHF, making the hyperparameter tuning process more efficient and less computationally burdensome.\n    *   **Broad Impact:** The generalizability of the adaptive scaling concept, demonstrated by its successful application to DPO and across different domains (robotics, LLMs), suggests its potential for widespread adoption and impact on future RLHF research and applications.\n    *   **Opens New Research Avenues:** `\\cite{hong2024mqe}` is the first to propose a principal approach to mitigate the \"almost untouched\" misalignment issue in RLHF, potentially inspiring further research into robust and efficient reward learning strategies.",
    "intriguing_abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) promises to align AI with human values, yet a critical flaw persists: existing methods, like Bradley-Terry models with cross-entropy loss, impose a rigid linear scaling between preference strength and reward differences.

Our method learns instance-specific scaling parameters ($\\tau_i$) that dynamically adjust the reward difference based on preference uncertainty: small for ambiguous preferences, large for clear ones. This non-linear scaling yields more versatile reward models and is efficiently optimized via a projected Newton method. Experiments across robotic control and Large Language Model (LLM) natural language generation demonstrate superior policy performance and, crucially, mitigate the long-standing misalignment issue.

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a prevalent approach to align AI systems with human values by learning rewards from human preference data. Due to various reasons, however, such data typically takes the form of rankings over pairs of trajectory segments, which fails to capture the varying strengths of preferences across different pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive preference loss, underpinned by distributionally robust optimization (DRO), designed to address this uncertainty in preference strength. By incorporating an adaptive scaling parameter into the loss for each pair, our method increases the flexibility of the reward function. Specifically, it assigns small scaling parameters to pairs with ambiguous preferences, leading to more comparable rewards, and large scaling parameters to those with clear preferences for more distinct rewards. Computationally, our proposed loss function is strictly convex and univariate with respect to each scaling parameter, enabling its efficient optimization through a simple second-order algorithm. Our method is versatile and can be readily adapted to various preference optimization frameworks, including direct preference optimization (DPO). Our experiments with robotic control and natural language generation with large language models (LLMs) show that our method not only improves policy performance but also aligns reward function selection more closely with policy optimization, simplifying the hyperparameter tuning process.",

      "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper `\\cite{hong2024mqe}` for a literature review:\n\n### Technical Paper Analysis: Adaptive Preference Scaling for Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback \\cite{hong2024mqe}\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** Existing Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methods, which rely on human preference data (rankings over trajectory segments), fail to capture the *varying strengths of preferences* across different pairs.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** Current approaches, like the Bradley-Terry (BT) model with cross-entropy loss, assume a *linear scaling* between the logit of the preference distribution and the reward difference. This restrictive assumption limits the flexibility of the learned reward function, hindering its ability to produce versatile rewards essential for effective downstream policy optimization.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n        *   **Standard BT Model/Cross-Entropy Loss:** Assumes linear scaling of preference logit with reward difference, which is inflexible and insufficient for varying preference strengths.\n        *   **Other Loss Functions (e.g., Song et al., Zhao et al.):** Some require *a priori knowledge* of preference ambiguity (extra labeling) or *limit the range* of learnable reward differences (e.g., hinge loss with zero gradient beyond a margin).\n        *   **Adaptive Temperature Scaling (ATS):** While also using instance-specific scalars, ATS is for confidence calibration, and its scaling parameter interpretation is *opposite* to `\\cite{hong2024mqe}`'s approach (ATS uses larger scaling for higher uncertainty, `\\cite{hong2024mqe}` for *clearer* preferences). ATS often requires additional networks or heuristic designs.\n        *   **Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO):** `\\cite{hong2024mqe}` is inspired by KL-constrained DRO but differs by applying a *separate KL constraint to each individual training data instance* (binary preference comparison) rather than a single constraint for the entire dataset, allowing for efficient, deterministic optimization.\n    *   **Positioning:** `\\cite{hong2024mqe}` offers a more broadly applicable solution that does not require additional labeling, does not sacrifice the ability to learn arbitrarily large reward differences, and provides a principled framework for learning adaptive scaling factors without complex auxiliary networks.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** `\\cite{hong2024mqe}` proposes a novel *adaptive preference loss function* inspired by Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO). This loss incorporates an *instance-specific scaling parameter* ($\\tau_i$) for each pair of trajectory segments.\n    *   **Novelty:**\n        *   **Adaptive Scaling:** The method learns these scaling parameters during training. It assigns *small scaling parameters* to pairs with ambiguous preferences (high uncertainty), leading to more comparable rewards, and *large scaling parameters* to pairs with clear preferences (low uncertainty), resulting in more distinct rewards. This implicitly makes the scaling between the preference distribution logit and the reward difference non-linear.\n        *   **DRO-based Derivation:** The adaptive loss is derived from a KL-constrained DRO formulation, providing a principled framework for learning the scaling factors.\n        *   **Computational Efficiency:** The proposed loss function is strictly convex and univariate with respect to each scaling parameter $\\tau_i$, enabling its efficient optimization through a simple second-order algorithm (projected Newton method) within a few iterations.\n        *   **Versatility:** The approach is generalizable and can be readily adapted to various preference optimization frameworks, including Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Adaptive Preference Loss Function:** Introduces an instance-specific scaling factor ($\\tau_i$) into the preference loss, derived from DRO, to enhance the flexibility of the reward model by adaptively adjusting the relationship between preference strength and reward difference.\n    *   **Efficient Optimization Algorithm:** Develops an efficient projected Newton method for optimizing the instance-specific scaling parameters, leveraging the strict convexity and univariate nature of the loss with respect to each $\\tau_i$.\n    *   **Theoretical Insight:** Provides a proposition demonstrating that the optimal scaling factor $\\tau^*$ adapts to the preference uncertainty, being small for ambiguous preferences and large for clear preferences.\n    *   **Improved Reward-Policy Alignment:** Identifies and provides a principal approach to mitigate the critical misalignment issue where reward models with high preference prediction accuracy often yield suboptimal downstream policies, simplifying the RLHF tuning process.\n    *   **Extension to DPO:** Demonstrates the method's generality by successfully integrating adaptive preference scaling into the DPO framework.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:**\n        *   Robotic control tasks using MuJoCo environments.\n        *   Natural language generation (NLG) tasks with Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Llama-2 7B, and proprietary models like Claude 2 as judges.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics:** Policy performance (e.g., task-specific rewards, generation quality) and the alignment between reward model selection (based on preference prediction accuracy) and downstream policy performance.\n    *   **Comparison Results:**\n        *   **Improved Policy Performance:** `\\cite{hong2024mqe}` consistently improves policy performance on both robotic control and natural language generation tasks compared to baselines.\n        *   **Enhanced Alignment:** The method significantly mitigates the misalignment between reward model selection and policy optimization. This means that selecting a reward model based solely on preference prediction accuracy (a simpler approach) yields a reasonably well-performing policy, reducing the need for computationally expensive joint tuning of reward and policy stages.\n        *   **DPO Integration Benefits:** When integrated with DPO, adaptive preference scaling boosts policy performance in NLG, particularly in scenarios where policy selection must rely solely on preference accuracy due to the high cost of LLM-based assessment.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations:** The theoretical analysis relies on the assumption of knowing the true preference distribution `p*`, which is not available in practice. The method introduces two new hyperparameters (`τ_0`, `τ_max`) for the bounds of the scaling factor, although the paper argues it simplifies overall tuning.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The method is designed for RLHF settings where human preferences are provided as pairwise rankings. It is shown to be applicable to both traditional reward modeling and direct policy optimization (DPO) paradigms across diverse domains like robotic control and LLM-based natural language generation.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art:** `\\cite{hong2024mqe}` significantly advances RLHF reward modeling by introducing a principled way to capture varying preference strengths, moving beyond the limitations of linear scaling assumptions in existing methods.\n    *   **Streamlines RLHF Workflow:** By improving the alignment between reward model selection and policy optimization, it addresses a major practical challenge in RLHF, making the hyperparameter tuning process more efficient and less computationally burdensome.\n    *   **Broad Impact:** The generalizability of the adaptive scaling concept, demonstrated by its successful application to DPO and across different domains (robotics, LLMs), suggests its potential for widespread adoption and impact on future RLHF research and applications.\n    *   **Opens New Research Avenues:** `\\cite{hong2024mqe}` is the first to propose a principal approach to mitigate the \"almost untouched\" misalignment issue in RLHF, potentially inspiring further research into robust and efficient reward learning strategies.",

Despite its promising prospects, this methodology has encountered with issues and challenges, hindering it from achieving the best performance. In particular, these approaches lack decent performance when navigating environments and solving tasks with large observation space, often resulting in sample-inefficiency and prolonged learning times.

This makes them ineffective for tasks spanning various domains with evolving problem-solving statuses.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing approaches**: Fine-tuning methods (e.g., \\cite{zhong2024enhancing, deepseek-ai2025deepseek, team2025google}) improve LLMs but are computationally expensive and require massive datasets.

      "abstract": "Despite rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), the token-level autoregressive nature constrains their complex reasoning capabilities. To enhance LLM reasoning, inference-time techniques, including Chain/Tree/Graph-of-Thought(s), successfully improve the performance, as they are fairly cost-effective by guiding reasoning through sophisticated logical structures without modifying LLMs'parameters. However, these manually predefined, task-agnostic frameworks are applied uniformly across diverse tasks, lacking adaptability. To improve this, we propose RL-of-Thoughts (RLoT), where we train a lightweight navigator model with reinforcement learning (RL) to adaptively enhance LLM reasoning at inference time. Specifically, we design five basic logic blocks from the perspective of human cognition. During the reasoning process, the trained RL navigator dynamically selects the suitable logic blocks and combines them into task-specific logical structures according to problem characteristics. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks (AIME, MATH, GPQA, etc.) with multiple LLMs (GPT, Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek) illustrate that RLoT outperforms established inference-time techniques by up to 13.4%. Remarkably, with less than 3K parameters, our RL navigator is able to make sub-10B LLMs comparable to 100B-scale counterparts. Moreover, the RL navigator demonstrates strong transferability: a model trained on one specific LLM-task pair can effectively generalize to unseen LLMs and tasks.

    "intriguing_abstract": "Reward hacking poses a critical challenge to aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), leading to models that score high on proxy Reward Models (RMs) but diverge from true human preferences, often sacrificing contextual relevance. Existing output-space regularizations offer limited solutions. This paper unveils a novel *internal mechanistic signature* of reward hacking: the \"Energy Loss Phenomenon.\" We empirically demonstrate that reward hacking is characterized by an excessive increase in the L1-norm difference between input and output hidden states in the LLM's final layer. Theoretically, we prove this increased energy loss directly suppresses contextual relevance. To combat this, we introduce Energy loss-aware PPO (EPPO), a novel algorithm that penalizes this internal energy loss increase during RL. EPPO, interpreted as an entropy-regularized RL method, moves beyond superficial output constraints, offering a broader optimization landscape. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and tasks show EPPO significantly outperforms existing methods, yielding more aligned and contextually relevant responses. This work provides a deeper understanding of RLHF dynamics and offers a robust, internal-state-driven approach to building trustworthy LLMs.",

      "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   The paper addresses the challenge of \"reward hacking\" in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for Large Language Models (LLMs) \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n    *   Reward hacking occurs when LLMs overfit to imperfections in the proxy Reward Model (RM), generating responses that achieve high RM scores but diverge from true human preferences, often exhibiting excessive redundancy, caution, or reduced contextual relevance \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n    *   This problem is critical because RLHF is a key technique for aligning LLMs with human preferences, and reward hacking undermines the effectiveness and trustworthiness of aligned models \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n    *   Existing solutions, such as improving reward modeling or applying output-space regularizations (e.g., KL divergence, response length penalties), often face limitations like overfitting, misspecification, or restricting the policy model's optimization landscape, thereby compromising RLHF performance \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   Previous efforts to mitigate reward hacking primarily focused on enhancing reward modeling (e.g., Coste et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024b) or designing RL regularizations that impose constraints on the output space (e.g., KL divergence, response length penalties) \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n    *   Limitations of these approaches include the inherent difficulty of achieving accurate and robust reward modeling due to overfitting, misspecification, and misgeneralization \\cite{miao2025ox0}. Output-space regularizations are criticized for overlooking the *underlying internal mechanisms* of reward hacking, which limits the optimization landscape and can degrade performance \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n    *   This work positions itself by investigating the *internal representation dynamics* of LLMs during RL to uncover the mechanisms of reward hacking, aiming to develop more effective regularization techniques that address the root cause rather than just the symptoms \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   The core technical method involves identifying and leveraging the \"Energy Loss Phenomenon\" within the LLM's final layer \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n    *   **Energy Loss Definition**: Energy loss in a layer is defined as the difference between the L1-norms of its input and output hidden states (`∆Eℓ(x) =∥hinℓ(x)∥1− ∥houtℓ(x)∥1`) \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n    *   **Energy Loss Phenomenon**: Empirically observed that energy loss in the LLM's final layer gradually increases during the RL process, and an *excessive* increase characterizes reward hacking \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n    *   **Theoretical Foundation**: The paper provides a theoretical proof that increased energy loss reduces the upper bound of contextual relevance in LLMs, which is a critical aspect of reward hacking \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n    *   **Energy loss-aware PPO (EPPO)**: A novel algorithm that mitigates reward hacking by penalizing the *increase* in energy loss in the LLM's final layer during reward calculation \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n        *   The modified reward function is `ˆr(y|x) =r(y|x)−η\f\f∆ESFTfinal(x)−∆ERLHFfinal(x)\f\f`, where `η` is a trade-off parameter and `∆ESFTfinal(x)` is the precomputed energy loss from the SFT model \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n    *   **Novelty**: EPPO's innovation lies in its focus on an *internal, mechanistic* aspect of LLM behavior (energy loss) rather than external output characteristics. This allows for a broader optimization landscape and is theoretically interpreted as an entropy-regularized RL algorithm, offering benefits like improved stability and enhanced exploration \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Phenomenon Identification**: Empirically identifies and formally defines the \"energy loss phenomenon\" as an internal manifestation of reward hacking within LLMs, specifically an excessive increase in energy loss in the final layer \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insight**: Provides a theoretical foundation by proving that increased energy loss in the LLM's final layer suppresses contextual relevance, thereby linking an internal model metric to a key aspect of reward hacking \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n    *   **Novel Algorithm**: Proposes EPPO, an energy loss-aware PPO algorithm that effectively mitigates reward hacking by penalizing the increase in energy loss during reward calculation \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n    *   **Theoretical Interpretation**: Demonstrates that EPPO can be conceptually interpreted as an entropy-regularized RL algorithm, providing deeper insights into its effectiveness and benefits \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments**: Conducted extensive experiments to validate the commonality of the energy loss phenomenon and the effectiveness of EPPO \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n        *   Observed energy loss dynamics during PPO and EPPO training across various LLMs (Figure 3) \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n        *   Analyzed energy loss distributions for SFT, normal RLHF, and hacking RLHF responses (Figure 4) \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n        *   Compared EPPO against various RL and RM baselines (Table 1) \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n        *   Evaluated EPPO's compatibility with advanced reward modeling techniques (Table 2) \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n    *   **Models and Tasks**: Evaluated on four popular LLMs (Llama3-8B, Llama2-7B, Mistral-7B, DeepSeek-7B) and two representative tasks (general dialogue using Anthropic-HH and AlpacaFarm, and summarization using Reddit TL;DR) \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n    *   **Metrics**: Key performance was assessed using GPT-4 for response comparison (Win/Tie/Lose percentages) \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n    *   **Key Results**:\n        *   Confirmed that energy loss in the final layer consistently increases during RL, and EPPO effectively suppresses this increase (Figure 3) \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n        *   Demonstrated that hacking samples exhibit excessively high energy loss, and EPPO mitigates this by reducing the prevalence of such high-energy-loss responses (Figure 4) \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n        *   EPPO consistently outperformed SFT, standard PPO, PPO with KL penalty, PPO with length penalty, and several advanced reward modeling techniques (ERM-Mean, ERM-WCO, ERM-UWO, WARM) across all tested LLMs and tasks, as judged by GPT-4 (Table 1) \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n        *   Showed that EPPO is compatible with and can further enhance performance when combined with advanced reward modeling techniques like ODIN and InfoRM (Table 2) \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   The theoretical analysis of reward hacking specifically focuses on \"contextual relevance\" as a critical aspect, acknowledging the broader complexity of reward hacking \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n    *   The definition of energy loss uses the L1-norm; other norms could potentially be explored \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n    *   The trade-off parameter `η` in EPPO requires tuning for optimal performance \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n    *   The work primarily focuses on policy models within the RLHF framework \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art**: This work provides a novel, internal-mechanistic perspective on reward hacking, moving beyond output-space regularizations and offering a deeper understanding of LLM behavior during RLHF \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n    *   **Improved Performance**: EPPO significantly enhances RLHF performance by effectively mitigating reward hacking, leading to more aligned and contextually relevant LLM responses \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n    *   **Theoretical Grounding**: The theoretical link between energy loss, contextual relevance, and entropy-regularized RL provides a robust foundation for the proposed method and offers new avenues for analyzing and improving RLHF \\cite{miao2025ox0}.\n    *   **Future Research Impact**: The findings open new research directions for designing more robust and effective RLHF algorithms by focusing on internal model states and dynamics, potentially leading to more stable and human-aligned LLMs \\cite{miao2025ox0}.",

      "abstract": "Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is critical to recent advances in generative artificial intelligence. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is widely applied to achieve this objective. A key step in RLHF is to learn the reward function from human feedback. However, human feedback is costly and time-consuming, making it essential to collect high-quality conversation data for human teachers to label. Additionally, different human teachers have different levels of expertise. It is thus critical to query the most appropriate teacher for their opinions. In this paper, we use offline reinforcement learning (RL) to formulate the alignment problem. Motivated by the idea of $D$-optimal design, we first propose a dual active reward learning algorithm for the simultaneous selection of conversations and teachers. Next, we apply pessimistic RL to solve the alignment problem, based on the learned reward estimator. Theoretically, we show that the reward estimator obtained through our proposed adaptive selection strategy achieves minimal generalized variance asymptotically, and prove that the sub-optimality of our pessimistic policy scales as $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$ with a given sample budget $T$. Through simulations and experiments on LLMs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm and its superiority over state-of-the-arts.",

However, this design is non-trivial, even for domain experts, due to the subjective nature of certain tasks that are hard to quantify explicitly. In recent works, large language models (LLMs) have been used for reward generation from natural language task descriptions, leveraging their extensive instruction tuning and commonsense understanding of human behavior. In this work, we hypothesize that LLMs, guided by human feedback, can be used to formulate reward functions that reflect human implicit knowledge. We study this in three challenging settings -- autonomous driving, humanoid locomotion, and dexterous manipulation -- wherein notions of ``good\"behavior are tacit and hard to quantify. To this end, we introduce REvolve, a truly evolutionary framework that uses LLMs for reward design in RL. REvolve generates and refines reward functions by utilizing human feedback to guide the evolution process, effectively translating implicit human knowledge into explicit reward functions for training (deep) RL agents. Experimentally, we demonstrate that agents trained on REvolve-designed rewards outperform other state-of-the-art baselines.",

These labelers, having diverse and selfish preferences, may provide untruthful feedback to influence the system's aggregation towards their own biases.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** Current RLHF practices typically average human feedback, failing to identify the most accurate labelers. This leads to a non-vanishing linear regret, O(T), over time T \\cite{hao2024iyj}. The challenge lies in designing an online mechanism that incentivizes truthful feedback from strategic agents while achieving high efficiency (sublinear regret) in a non-monetary setting, especially when labelers' true preferences are hidden and dynamic.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches:**\n        *   **Current RLHF practice:** Simply averages human feedback with uniform weights \\cite{hao2024iyj}.\n        *   **Monetary mechanism design:** Recent works (e.g., [3, 9, 17, 18]) propose monetary payments to incentivize truthful feedback.\n        *   **Algorithmic game theory (non-monetary):** The \"median\" scheme (e.g., [10, 22]) is used in contexts like facility location games to aggregate multi-agent reports.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n        *   **Averaging feedback:** Fails to identify the most accurate labeler, leading to a non-vanishing regret of O(T) \\cite{hao2024iyj}.\n        *   **Monetary mechanisms:** Involve complex billing, may be difficult to implement, and primarily assume one-shot or offline feedback, not the dynamic online setting where strategic misreporting can be more pronounced \\cite{hao2024iyj}.\n        *   **Median scheme:** Proven to be untruthful for the online problem and also incurs a non-vanishing regret of O(T) \\cite{hao2024iyj}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper formulates the online learning from strategic human feedback as a new dynamic Bayesian game. It proposes an \"Online Weighted Aggregation Mechanism\" that dynamically adjusts each human labeler's weight in the preference aggregation process \\cite{hao2024iyj}.\n    *   **Novelty:** Unlike existing methods, this approach introduces a Stage III in the RLHF loop dedicated to reweighing human labelers. The weight `w_t+1_i` for labeler `i` at time `t+1` is updated based on their feedback accuracy in the previous time slot `t`, specifically using the squared difference between their reported preference `ˆP_i` and the realized binary ground-truth preference `p_t_j` (Eq. 5) \\cite{hao2024iyj}. This dynamic adjustment, controlled by a step-size parameter `α`, ensures that labelers whose feedback is closer to the realized preference receive larger relative weights over time.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods:**\n        *   First to formulate online learning from strategic human feedback in LLM fine-tuning as a dynamic Bayesian game \\cite{hao2024iyj}.\n        *   Proposed an \"Online Weighted Aggregation Mechanism\" that dynamically updates labeler weights based on their feedback accuracy (Eq. 5) \\cite{hao2024iyj}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis:**\n        *   Proved that the proposed mechanism is **truthful** (Proposition 2), meaning labelers maximize their long-term influence by reporting their actual preferences \\cite{hao2024iyj}.\n        *   Demonstrated **high efficiency** by proving the mechanism achieves a sublinear regret of O(T^1/2) (Theorem 1), which translates to a vanishing time-average regret (lim T→∞ R(T)/T = 0) \\cite{hao2024iyj}. This is a significant improvement over the O(T) regret of benchmark schemes.\n        *   Derived an optimal step-size `α = (2/3) * sqrt(2lnN / T)` for the mechanism \\cite{hao2024iyj}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** Simulations were performed using a paragraph summarization task based on the Reddit TL;DR summarization dataset, with DPO for policy training. Synthetic data was used to generate human labeler preferences and ground-truth binary preferences \\cite{hao2024iyj}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results:**\n        *   **Labeler Weight Evolution (Figure 1):** Demonstrated that the mechanism successfully assigns weights proportional to labeler feedback accuracy over time. More accurate labelers maintained higher relative weights, while less accurate ones saw their weights diminish \\cite{hao2024iyj}.\n        *   **Time-Average Regret (Figure 2):**\n            *   The proposed mechanism's time-average regret decreased with increasing time slots (T), approaching zero, consistent with the O(T^1/2) theoretical bound \\cite{hao2024iyj}.\n            *   In contrast, both the average feedback aggregation and median aggregation benchmark schemes exhibited time-average regrets that did not decrease with T and remained greater than zero, consistent with their O(T) theoretical bounds \\cite{hao2024iyj}.\n        *   **Overall:** Simulation results clearly showed the proposed mechanism's \"great advantages\" in reducing time-average regret compared to the two benchmark schemes \\cite{hao2024iyj}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The paper assumes a Bernoulli belief for human labelers on the ground-truth preference `p_t_j` \\cite{hao2024iyj}. The realized binary preference `p_t_j` is assumed to be learnable from customer experience \\cite{hao2024iyj}. The step-size `α` depends on `N` (number of labelers) and `T` (total time slots), implying some knowledge or estimation of these parameters.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The mechanism is designed for online learning from strategic human feedback in LLM fine-tuning, specifically in scenarios where human preferences are aggregated and ground-truth feedback can be observed (e.g., through user experience) to update labeler weights \\cite{hao2024iyj}. It focuses on non-monetary incentives.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** This work is the first to address the critical issue of strategic human feedback in *online* LLM fine-tuning using non-monetary mechanisms \\cite{hao2024iyj}. By achieving a sublinear regret of O(T^1/2) and ensuring truthful feedback, it significantly advances beyond current practices (O(T) regret) that ignore strategic behavior or rely on less practical monetary incentives \\cite{hao2024iyj}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:** The proposed dynamic Bayesian game formulation and the truthful, efficient online weighted aggregation mechanism provide a strong foundation for future research in robust and aligned LLM fine-tuning. It opens avenues for exploring more complex strategic behaviors, different feedback modalities, and adaptive step-size strategies in real-world human-in-the-loop AI systems \\cite{hao2024iyj}.",

The challenge lies in designing an online mechanism that incentivizes truthful feedback from strategic agents while achieving high efficiency (sublinear regret) in a non-monetary setting, especially when labelers' true preferences are hidden and dynamic.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches:**\n        *   **Current RLHF practice:** Simply averages human feedback with uniform weights \\cite{hao2024iyj}.\n        *   **Monetary mechanism design:** Recent works (e.g., [3, 9, 17, 18]) propose monetary payments to incentivize truthful feedback.\n        *   **Algorithmic game theory (non-monetary):** The \"median\" scheme (e.g., [10, 22]) is used in contexts like facility location games to aggregate multi-agent reports.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n        *   **Averaging feedback:** Fails to identify the most accurate labeler, leading to a non-vanishing regret of O(T) \\cite{hao2024iyj}.\n        *   **Monetary mechanisms:** Involve complex billing, may be difficult to implement, and primarily assume one-shot or offline feedback, not the dynamic online setting where strategic misreporting can be more pronounced \\cite{hao2024iyj}.\n        *   **Median scheme:** Proven to be untruthful for the online problem and also incurs a non-vanishing regret of O(T) \\cite{hao2024iyj}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper formulates the online learning from strategic human feedback as a new dynamic Bayesian game. It proposes an \"Online Weighted Aggregation Mechanism\" that dynamically adjusts each human labeler's weight in the preference aggregation process \\cite{hao2024iyj}.\n    *   **Novelty:** Unlike existing methods, this approach introduces a Stage III in the RLHF loop dedicated to reweighing human labelers. The weight `w_t+1_i` for labeler `i` at time `t+1` is updated based on their feedback accuracy in the previous time slot `t`, specifically using the squared difference between their reported preference `ˆP_i` and the realized binary ground-truth preference `p_t_j` (Eq. 5) \\cite{hao2024iyj}. This dynamic adjustment, controlled by a step-size parameter `α`, ensures that labelers whose feedback is closer to the realized preference receive larger relative weights over time.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods:**\n        *   First to formulate online learning from strategic human feedback in LLM fine-tuning as a dynamic Bayesian game \\cite{hao2024iyj}.\n        *   Proposed an \"Online Weighted Aggregation Mechanism\" that dynamically updates labeler weights based on their feedback accuracy (Eq. 5) \\cite{hao2024iyj}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis:**\n        *   Proved that the proposed mechanism is **truthful** (Proposition 2), meaning labelers maximize their long-term influence by reporting their actual preferences \\cite{hao2024iyj}.\n        *   Demonstrated **high efficiency** by proving the mechanism achieves a sublinear regret of O(T^1/2) (Theorem 1), which translates to a vanishing time-average regret (lim T→∞ R(T)/T = 0) \\cite{hao2024iyj}. This is a significant improvement over the O(T) regret of benchmark schemes.\n        *   Derived an optimal step-size `α = (2/3) * sqrt(2lnN / T)` for the mechanism \\cite{hao2024iyj}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** Simulations were performed using a paragraph summarization task based on the Reddit TL;DR summarization dataset, with DPO for policy training. Synthetic data was used to generate human labeler preferences and ground-truth binary preferences \\cite{hao2024iyj}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results:**\n        *   **Labeler Weight Evolution (Figure 1):** Demonstrated that the mechanism successfully assigns weights proportional to labeler feedback accuracy over time. More accurate labelers maintained higher relative weights, while less accurate ones saw their weights diminish \\cite{hao2024iyj}.\n        *   **Time-Average Regret (Figure 2):**\n            *   The proposed mechanism's time-average regret decreased with increasing time slots (T), approaching zero, consistent with the O(T^1/2) theoretical bound \\cite{hao2024iyj}.\n            *   In contrast, both the average feedback aggregation and median aggregation benchmark schemes exhibited time-average regrets that did not decrease with T and remained greater than zero, consistent with their O(T) theoretical bounds \\cite{hao2024iyj}.\n        *   **Overall:** Simulation results clearly showed the proposed mechanism's \"great advantages\" in reducing time-average regret compared to the two benchmark schemes \\cite{hao2024iyj}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The paper assumes a Bernoulli belief for human labelers on the ground-truth preference `p_t_j` \\cite{hao2024iyj}. The realized binary preference `p_t_j` is assumed to be learnable from customer experience \\cite{hao2024iyj}. The step-size `α` depends on `N` (number of labelers) and `T` (total time slots), implying some knowledge or estimation of these parameters.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The mechanism is designed for online learning from strategic human feedback in LLM fine-tuning, specifically in scenarios where human preferences are aggregated and ground-truth feedback can be observed (e.g., through user experience) to update labeler weights \\cite{hao2024iyj}. It focuses on non-monetary incentives.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** This work is the first to address the critical issue of strategic human feedback in *online* LLM fine-tuning using non-monetary mechanisms \\cite{hao2024iyj}. By achieving a sublinear regret of O(T^1/2) and ensuring truthful feedback, it significantly advances beyond current practices (O(T) regret) that ignore strategic behavior or rely on less practical monetary incentives \\cite{hao2024iyj}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:** The proposed dynamic Bayesian game formulation and the truthful, efficient online weighted aggregation mechanism provide a strong foundation for future research in robust and aligned LLM fine-tuning. It opens avenues for exploring more complex strategic behaviors, different feedback modalities, and adaptive step-size strategies in real-world human-in-the-loop AI systems \\cite{hao2024iyj}.",

Extensive experiments on diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that RISE consistently improves model's problem-solving accuracy while concurrently fostering strong self-verification skills.

    "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \"Measuring memorization in RLHF for code completion\" by Pappu et al. \\cite{pappu2024yoj} for a literature review, emphasizing technical innovations and empirical validation:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper investigates how training data memorization is affected by or introduced during the Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) alignment process for large language models (LLMs).\n    *   **Importance & Challenge**: Understanding memorization in RLHF is crucial because real user data, often sensitive, may be collected for alignment. If this data is memorized and later regurgitated, it raises significant privacy and commercial concerns. Most existing memorization studies focus on pre-training or fine-tuning, leaving a gap in understanding RLHF's impact.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: The work positions itself against existing memorization analyses primarily focused on pre-training and direct fine-tuning. It also compares RLHF to direct preference learning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and ΨPO (specifically Identity Preference Optimization, IPO), which aim to simplify alignment by removing the intermediary reward model.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Prior work largely overlooks memorization dynamics within the multi-stage RLHF process.

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has become the dominant method to align large models to user preferences. Unlike fine-tuning, for which there are many studies regarding training data memorization, it is not clear how memorization is affected by or introduced in the RLHF alignment process. Understanding this relationship is important as real user data may be collected and used to align large models; if user data is memorized during RLHF and later regurgitated, this could raise privacy concerns. In addition to RLHF, other methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and $\\Psi$PO have gained popularity for learning directly from human preferences, removing the need for optimizing intermediary reward models with reinforcement learning. In this work, we analyze how training data memorization can surface and propagate through each phase of RLHF and direct preference learning. We focus our study on code completion models, as code completion is one of the most popular use cases for large language models. We find that RLHF significantly decreases the chance that data used for reward modeling and reinforcement learning is memorized in comparison to directly fine-tuning on this data, but that examples already memorized during the fine-tuning stage of RLHF, will, in the majority of cases, remain memorized after RLHF. In contrast, we find that aligning by learning directly from human preference data via a special case of $\\Psi$PO, Identity Preference Optimization (IPO), increases the likelihood that training data is regurgitated compared to RLHF. Our work suggests that RLHF, as opposed to direct preference learning, is a safer way to mitigate the risk of regurgitating sensitive preference data when aligning large language models. We find our conclusions are robust across multiple code completion datasets, tasks, and model scales.",

      "abstract": "Reward inference (learning a reward model from human preferences) is a critical intermediate step in the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) pipeline for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). In practice, RLHF faces fundamental challenges such as distribution shift, reward model overfitting, and problem misspecification. An alternative approach is direct policy optimization without reward inference, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which provides a much simpler pipeline and has shown empirical success in LLM applications. However, DPO utilizes the closed-form expression between the optimal policy and the reward function, which is only suitable under the bandit setting or deterministic MDPs. This paper develops two RLHF algorithms without reward inference for general RL problems beyond bandits and deterministic MDPs, and general preference models beyond the Bradley-Terry model. The key idea is to estimate the local value function difference from human preferences and then approximate the policy gradient with a zeroth-order gradient approximator. For both algorithms, we establish polynomial convergence rates in terms of the number of policy gradient iterations, the number of trajectory samples, and human preference queries per iteration. Numerical experiments in stochastic environments validate the performance of our proposed algorithms, outperforming popular RLHF baselines such as DPO and PPO. Our paper shows there exist provably efficient methods to solve general RLHF problems without reward inference.",

      "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review, prioritizing technical innovations and empirical validation:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   The paper critically evaluates the effectiveness of current AI alignment attempts, particularly for Large Language Models (LLMs), using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and AI Feedback (RLAIF) methods \\cite{lindstrm20253o2}.\n    *   It specifically addresses the shortcomings of the widely adopted alignment goals of \"honesty, harmlessness, and helpfulness\" (HHH principle) \\cite{lindstrm20253o2}.\n    *   This problem is important because RLHF is presented as a primary method for AI oversight and safety, with claims of aligning LLMs to human values, yet its ability to capture complex human ethics and ensure true safety is challenged \\cite{lindstrm20253o2}. The increasing widespread use of LLMs across domains necessitates a deeper analysis beyond mere technical performance \\cite{lindstrm20253o2}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   The work relates to existing approaches like RLHF (using human preferences for model optimization, credited for successes in ChatGPT, Claude 2, Llama 2) and RLAIF (using AI-generated feedback to alleviate human annotation bottlenecks) \\cite{lindstrm20253o2}.\n    *   Limitations of previous solutions include:\n        *   RLHF's reliance on high-quality human labels, making scaling difficult \\cite{lindstrm20253o2}.\n        *   RLAIF's susceptibility to \"hallucinations\" when LLMs act as annotators, despite cost benefits \\cite{lindstrm20253o2}.\n        *   Fundamental technical challenges in collecting human feedback, training reward models, and training the policy, some of which are deemed unsolvable within the RLHF framework itself \\cite{lindstrm20253o2}.\n        *   The inherent vagueness and lack of clear definition for the HHH principles, leading to inconsistent interpretations by crowdworkers \\cite{lindstrm20253o2}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   The core technical method is a multidisciplinary sociotechnical critique, integrating technical, philosophical, and system safety perspectives to analyze RLHF's theoretical underpinnings and practical implementations \\cite{lindstrm20253o2}.\n    *   This approach is novel by:\n        *   Highlighting \"the curse of flexibility\" from system safety literature (Leveson, 2012) as a fundamental challenge for generalist LLMs, where increased power and flexibility hinder the ability to properly express, engineer, and validate safety requirements \\cite{lindstrm20253o2}.\n        *   Examining the internal tensions and ethical issues within RLHF, such as trade-offs between user-friendliness and deception, and flexibility and interpretability \\cite{lindstrm20253o2}.\n        *   Proposing an alternative vision for AI safety that positions RLHF within a broader context of comprehensive design across institutions, processes, and technological systems, advocating for AI safety as a sociotechnical discipline \\cite{lindstrm20253o2}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Theoretical insights/analysis:** Identification of inherent tensions and vagueness within the HHH principle, arguing that its operationalization (e.g., \"least harmful\") oversimplifies complex ethical considerations and may even tolerate harm \\cite{lindstrm20253o2}.\n    *   **Novel analytical framework:** Application of the \"curse of flexibility\" concept to LLMs, explaining why their generalist nature makes it difficult to define and ensure safety requirements through model-centric technical design alone \\cite{lindstrm20253o2}.\n    *   **Identification of neglected issues:** Discussion of ethically relevant issues often overlooked in alignment discussions, such as the trade-offs between user-friendliness and potential deception, and system flexibility versus interpretability \\cite{lindstrm20253o2}.\n    *   **System design/architectural innovation (conceptual):** Proposing a shift from purely technical alignment to a comprehensive sociotechnical design approach for AI safety, integrating institutional, process, and technological considerations \\cite{lindstrm20253o2}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   The paper does not present new experimental results but critically analyzes and references existing empirical observations and technical literature to support its claims:\n        *   It cites Casper et al. (2023) for a taxonomy of open technical problems and limitations of RLHF, categorizing them as tractable or fundamental \\cite{lindstrm20253o2}.\n        *   It refers to the phenomenon of \"jailbreaking\" LLMs (Zhuo et al., 2023; Mozes et al., 2023) as empirical evidence that constraints imposed by RLHF can be circumvented, leading to unintended or harmful behavior \\cite{lindstrm20253o2}.\n        *   It highlights findings from Wu and Aji (2025) suggesting that \"style is more important than substance\" in human feedback, where factual errors are rated more favorably than grammatical ones, illustrating the superficiality of current HHH evaluations \\cite{lindstrm20253o2}.\n        *   It references established literature on known harms of LLMs (Bender et al., 2021; Weidinger et al., 2021) to argue that RLHF's \"in-the-lab\" decontextualized evaluations fail to address systemic harms emerging from real-world sociotechnical embedding \\cite{lindstrm20253o2}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   The paper's scope is a critical evaluation of RLHF/RLAIF for AI safety and ethics; it explicitly states that it does not question the general performance improvements LLMs have achieved through feedback-guided techniques \\cite{lindstrm20253o2}.\n    *   A key assumption is that RLHF is often treated as a \"silver bullet\" for AI safety, and the paper aims to show its deep insufficiency in this regard if not integrated into a broader approach \\cite{lindstrm20253o2}.\n    *   Technical limitations include the inherent difficulty in defining and operationalizing subjective ethical principles like HHH, and the challenge of translating these into robust software requirements \\cite{lindstrm20253o2}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   This work significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing a robust, multidisciplinary critique of the dominant AI alignment paradigm, moving beyond purely algorithmic considerations \\cite{lindstrm20253o2}.\n    *   It highlights fundamental technical and conceptual limitations of current RLHF/RLAIF approaches that cannot be solved by incremental technical improvements within the existing framework \\cite{lindstrm20253o2}.\n    *   Its potential impact on future research is to steer the field of AI safety towards a more holistic, sociotechnical discipline, encouraging researchers to consider broader institutional, process, and ethical dimensions alongside technical design, rather than solely focusing on model-level alignment \\cite{lindstrm20253o2}.",

We focus on alignment by Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in particular. While popular preference optimization methods exhibit good empirical performance in practice, they are not theoretically guaranteed to converge to the optimal policy and can provably fail when the data coverage is sparse by classical offline reinforcement learning (RL) results. On the other hand, a recent line of work has focused on theoretically motivated preference optimization methods with provable guarantees, but these are not computationally efficient for large-scale applications like LLM alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose SPAC, a new offline preference optimization method with self-play, inspired by the on-average pessimism technique from the offline RL literature, to be the first provable and scalable approach to LLM alignment. We both provide theoretical analysis for its convergence under single-policy concentrability for the general function approximation setting and demonstrate its competitive empirical performance for LLM alignment on a 7B Mistral model with Open LLM Leaderboard evaluations.",

This is achieved by a change-of-variable trick, similar to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which implicitly incorporates the reward model into the policy update, eliminating the need for an explicit reward function and simplifying implementation.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:**\n        *   **First to achieve both provability and scalability:** SPAC is presented as the first method that offers provable convergence guarantees (under single-policy concentrability) while being computationally scalable for general function approximation, specifically LLMs.\n        *   **On-average pessimism:** This approach allows for a single-timescale iterative self-play algorithm, which is more efficient than methods requiring complex pointwise confidence region estimations.\n        *   **DPO-like practical implementation:** The ability to cast the algorithm into a direct policy optimization framework makes it highly practical and easily implementable on existing RLHF codebases.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods:**\n        *   Introduction of **SPAC**, a novel offline preference optimization algorithm based on a Stackelberg game formulation with an adversarial critic and an \"on-average pessimistic\" reward estimate.\n        *   Development of a **practical, single-timescale direct preference optimization algorithm (Algorithm 2)** for LLM alignment, which implicitly handles reward modeling and is easy to integrate with existing RLHF codebases.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis:**\n        *   **Provable Convergence:** \\cite{ji2024d5f} provides theoretical analysis demonstrating that SPAC converges to a near-optimal policy under the weak **single-policy concentrability assumption** for general function approximation settings, a crucial guarantee for offline LLM alignment.\n        *   Non-asymptotic analysis on its suboptimality is also provided.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** Alignment experiments were performed on a **7B Mistral model**.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results:** The fine-tuned models were evaluated using **Open LLM Leaderboard evaluations**. \\cite{ji2024d5f} demonstrates **competitive empirical performance** against popular alignment baselines in practice, confirming its effectiveness.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The theoretical guarantees rely on the **single-policy concentrability assumption** for the offline preference data. While considered a weak assumption, it still implies a certain level of data coverage. The underlying preference model is assumed to follow the Bradley-Terry model.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** Primarily designed for **offline alignment of LLMs** using human preference data, applicable to settings where RLHF is framed as an offline contextual bandit problem. It is suitable for **general function approximation settings**, making it relevant for complex neural network architectures.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art:** \\cite{ji2024d5f} makes a significant advancement by being the first to propose an offline preference optimization method that is *both provably convergent* (under weak data assumptions) and *computationally scalable* for large-scale LLM alignment with general function approximation. This addresses a critical gap in the field.\n    *   **Enhances Reliability and Practicality:** It provides much-needed theoretical guarantees for LLM alignment, mitigating risks associated with reward hacking and sparse data, while simultaneously offering a practical, DPO-like implementation that can be easily adopted by practitioners.\n    *   **Potential Impact:** This work could inspire future research into robust and scalable alignment techniques, particularly exploring \"on-average pessimism\" and Stackelberg game formulations for other complex offline reinforcement learning problems.",

To alleviate some of the computational burden of fine-tuning, parameter efficient methods, like LoRA were introduced. In this work, we empirically evaluate the setup of Parameter Efficient Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (PE-RLHF) that leverages LoRA fine-tuning for Reward Modeling, and Reinforcement Learning. We benchmark the PE-RLHF setup on six diverse datasets spanning summarization, harmless/helpful response generation, UI automation, and visual question answering in terms of effectiveness of the trained models, and the training resources required. Our findings show, for the first time, that PE-RLHF achieves comparable performance to RLHF, while significantly reducing training time (up to 90% faster for reward models, and 30% faster for RL), and memory footprint (up to 50% reduction for reward models, and 27% for RL). We provide comprehensive ablations across LoRA ranks, and model sizes for both reward modeling and reinforcement learning.

    "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \\cite{wang2023v62} for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** Applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to sequence generation models (e.g., machine translation, summarization, LLMs) is computationally challenging due to the need for large-scale sampling over vast action spaces (vocabulary) and long action sequences. This \"exploration\" phase leads to excessive memory consumption and long training times.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** RL is crucial for optimizing long-term, sequence-level rewards (like BLEU, ROUGE, human feedback) and mitigating exposure bias. However, the computational burden of sampling makes its practical application difficult, especially with large models and datasets. Existing methods often overlook or inadequately address this efficiency problem.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** The work builds upon the established use of RL in sequence generation, including methods like REINFORCE \\cite{wang2023v62} and Minimum Risk Training (MRT) \\cite{wang2023v62}, and its application to Large Language Models (LLMs) with human feedback (RLHF) \\cite{wang2023v62}.

This bottleneck leads to excessive memory consumption and protracted training times, hindering the practical application of RL for optimizing crucial sequence-level rewards and mitigating exposure bias in models like Transformers and LLMs.\n\nWe introduce Efficient Sampling-based RL (ESRL), a novel framework that revolutionizes RL training for tasks such as machine translation, summarization, and critically, Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). ESRL features a groundbreaking **two-stage sampling** mechanism that decouples sequence sampling from gradient computation, leveraging parallel processing to drastically reduce memory footprint. Complementing this is a **dynamic sampling** approach that adaptively adjusts sampling size and temperature based on estimated model capability, eliminating redundant exploration. Our holistic framework also integrates a fusion of MRT and REINFORCE, alongside a FIFO-based baseline reward.\n\nEmpirical evaluations across diverse tasks demonstrate ESRL's unprecedented efficiency and superior performance. It reduces memory consumption by 47% and training time by 39% compared to baselines, while achieving significant quality improvements (e.g., over 1.04 BLEU gain in MT and +30.00 Vicuna score in RLHF).

This is a computational challenge as presented by the practice of sequence generation problems, such as machine translation, where we often deal with a large action space (e.g., a vocabulary) and a long action sequence (e.g., a translation). In this work, we introduce two-stage sampling and dynamic sampling approaches to improve the sampling efficiency during training sequence generation models via RL. We experiment with our approaches on the traditional sequence generation tasks, including machine translation and abstractive summarization. Furthermore, we evaluate our approaches in RL from human feedback (RLHF) through training a large language model using the reward model. Experimental results show that the efficient sampling-based RL, referred to as ESRL, can outperform all baselines in terms of both training efficiency and memory consumption. Notably, ESRL yields consistent performance gains over the strong REINFORCE, minimum risk training, and proximal policy optimization methods.

This phenomenon leads to a discrepancy where LLM performance appears to improve under the reward model (proxy reward) but deviates from true human objectives (gold reward).\n    *   The primary cause is **extrapolation error** by the reward model when evaluating **out-of-distribution (OOD) responses** \\cite{dai2025ygq}. Due to the exploratory nature of RL, LLMs frequently generate responses outside the reward model's training data distribution, leading to overestimation of rewards and incorrect policy evaluation. This issue is exacerbated as the frequency of OOD responses increases during policy iteration.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   Existing approaches include **KL divergence penalties** \\cite{dai2025ygq} (e.g., from the SFT model) and **maximum reward constraints** \\cite{dai2025ygq}. However, these methods are often insensitive to the in-distribution (ID) region of the reward model, making it difficult to set appropriate penalty strengths and preventing full exploration of the ID region for optimal solutions. They tend to keep policies conservatively close to the initial model.\n    *   Other methods involve **uncertainty quantifiers** \\cite{dai2025ygq} or **reward model ensembles** \\cite{dai2025ygq}. Uncertainty quantifiers may not generalize well to OOD regions, while ensembles can suffer from consistent overestimation across models and higher computational costs.\n    *   A common limitation across these prior methods is that while they handle OOD responses pessimistically, they often **impact the evaluation of ID responses**, potentially leading to suboptimal solutions \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n    *   The proposed **Behavior-Supported Policy Optimization (BSPO)** method distinguishes itself by using value regularization to guide policy iteration *only* within the ID region, penalizing OOD values without affecting ID ones, and offering theoretical convergence guarantees that previous methods lack \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   The core technical method is **Behavior-Supported Policy Optimization (BSPO)**, which employs **value regularization** to restrict policy iteration to the in-distribution (ID) region of the reward model \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n    *   **OOD Detection**: BSPO defines a \"behavior policy\" ($\\beta$) as the next-token distribution derived from the reward model's training dataset. An action is \"behavior-supported\" if $\\beta(a|s) > 0$. Any action not supported by this distribution is considered OOD, leading to extrapolation errors \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n    *   **Behavior-Supported Bellman Operator**: A novel operator, $T^\\pi_\\beta Q(s, a)$, is introduced. It functions as the standard Bellman operator $T^\\pi Q(s, a)$ for behavior-supported actions (ID actions) but assigns a minimum possible Q-value ($Q_{min}$) to unsupported actions (OOD actions) \\cite{dai2025ygq}. This effectively penalizes OOD values without impacting ID ones.\n    *   This value regularization reduces the generation of OOD responses during RL, thereby preventing overestimation caused by reward model extrapolation errors \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel OOD Detection**: Proposes using the next-token distribution from the reward training dataset to characterize the ID region and detect OOD responses for reward prediction \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n    *   **Behavior-Supported Policy Optimization (BSPO) Algorithm**: Introduces the first method that uses value regularization to address reward over-optimization, specifically designed to penalize OOD values without affecting ID ones \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n    *   **Theoretical Guarantees**: Proves that the behavior-supported Bellman operator is a $\\gamma$-contraction, guaranteeing convergence to a unique fixed point. It also proves that BSPO guarantees monotonic improvement of the supported policy until convergence to the optimal behavior-supported policy \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n    *   **Lightweight Implementation**: Implements BSPO using a \"ScoreLM\" model, which combines the original language model head for next-token prediction and a new score head for reward prediction, enabling efficient prediction of both rewards and behavior distributions \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   Extensive experiments were conducted to demonstrate BSPO's effectiveness \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n    *   **OOD Detection Efficacy**: Empirical results (Figure 1c) show that as policy iterates, the proportion of unsupported responses increases, and the proxy reward model's predictive accuracy significantly drops for these unsupported (OOD) responses (from ~76% for supported to ~58% for unsupported), validating the OOD detection mechanism \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n    *   **Performance Metrics**: BSPO was evaluated against baselines in preventing reward over-optimization due to OOD evaluation and in finding the optimal ID policy \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n    *   **Comparison Results**: Empirical results show that BSPO consistently **outperforms baselines** in these key metrics, effectively mitigating reward over-optimization and guiding the policy towards optimal solutions within the ID region \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n    *   **ScoreLM Validation**: The ScoreLM model's prediction accuracy was shown to be comparable to standard reward models across different scales on the test set (Figure 2b), confirming its viability for the proposed method \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   The method relies on a well-pretrained LLM for next-token prediction to define the behavior policy and detect OOD actions \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n    *   The paper notes that methods aimed at enhancing the generalization of reward models (e.g., through larger models or datasets) are complementary and can be combined with BSPO, implying that BSPO does not entirely negate the need for robust reward modeling but rather provides a mechanism to handle its inherent limitations \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n    *   The scope of applicability is primarily within RLHF for LLMs, specifically addressing the reward over-optimization problem caused by OOD evaluation.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   BSPO significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by being the **first method to use value regularization** to address reward over-optimization in RLHF \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n    *   It provides a principled way to **restrict policy search to the ID region** of the reward model, preventing extrapolation errors without conservatively limiting exploration within the valid region \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n    *   The **strong theoretical guarantees** (monotonic improvement, convergence to optimal behavior-supported policy) provide a robust foundation for its effectiveness \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n    *   Its ability to effectively handle OOD responses while preserving unbiased evaluation for ID actions has significant potential impact on future research in aligning LLMs with human preferences, leading to more stable and reliable RLHF processes \\cite{dai2025ygq}.",
    "intriguing_abstract": "The promise of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to align Large Language Models (LLMs) often falters due to a critical challenge: **reward over-optimization**. This phenomenon creates an illusion of performance improvement under a proxy reward model, while the LLM's outputs diverge from true human objectives. The culprit? **Extrapolation error** by the reward model when evaluating **out-of-distribution (OOD) responses**, a common occurrence during RL exploration.\n\nWe introduce **Behavior-Supported Policy Optimization (BSPO)**, a novel and principled framework that fundamentally mitigates this issue. Unlike prior methods that often conservatively constrain policy search or impact in-distribution (ID) evaluations, BSPO employs **value regularization** to precisely restrict policy iteration to the reward model's ID region. Our approach defines a \"behavior policy\" from the reward model's training data to robustly detect OOD actions. We then introduce a **Behavior-Supported Bellman Operator** that penalizes OOD values without affecting ID ones, ensuring unbiased learning within the valid domain.\n\nBSPO offers **strong theoretical guarantees**, including monotonic policy improvement and convergence to an optimal behavior-supported policy.

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is an effective method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, reward over-optimization remains an open challenge leading to discrepancies between the performance of LLMs under the reward model and the true human objectives. A primary contributor to reward over-optimization is the extrapolation error that arises when the reward model evaluates out-of-distribution (OOD) responses. However, current methods still fail to prevent the increasing frequency of OOD response generation during the reinforcement learning (RL) process and are not effective at handling extrapolation errors from OOD responses. In this work, we propose the Behavior-Supported Policy Optimization (BSPO) method to mitigate the reward over-optimization issue. Specifically, we define behavior policy as the next token distribution of the reward training dataset to model the in-distribution (ID) region of the reward model. Building on this, we introduce the behavior-supported Bellman operator to regularize the value function, penalizing all OOD values without impacting the ID ones. Consequently, BSPO reduces the generation of OOD responses during the RL process, thereby avoiding overestimation caused by the reward model's extrapolation errors. Theoretically, we prove that BSPO guarantees a monotonic improvement of the supported policy until convergence to the optimal behavior-supported policy. Empirical results from extensive experiments show that BSPO outperforms baselines in preventing reward over-optimization due to OOD evaluation and finding the optimal ID policy.",

Uncertainty quantifiers may not generalize well to OOD regions, while ensembles can suffer from consistent overestimation across models and higher computational costs.\n    *   A common limitation across these prior methods is that while they handle OOD responses pessimistically, they often **impact the evaluation of ID responses**, potentially leading to suboptimal solutions \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n    *   The proposed **Behavior-Supported Policy Optimization (BSPO)** method distinguishes itself by using value regularization to guide policy iteration *only* within the ID region, penalizing OOD values without affecting ID ones, and offering theoretical convergence guarantees that previous methods lack \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   The core technical method is **Behavior-Supported Policy Optimization (BSPO)**, which employs **value regularization** to restrict policy iteration to the in-distribution (ID) region of the reward model \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n    *   **OOD Detection**: BSPO defines a \"behavior policy\" ($\\beta$) as the next-token distribution derived from the reward model's training dataset. An action is \"behavior-supported\" if $\\beta(a|s) > 0$. Any action not supported by this distribution is considered OOD, leading to extrapolation errors \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n    *   **Behavior-Supported Bellman Operator**: A novel operator, $T^\\pi_\\beta Q(s, a)$, is introduced. It functions as the standard Bellman operator $T^\\pi Q(s, a)$ for behavior-supported actions (ID actions) but assigns a minimum possible Q-value ($Q_{min}$) to unsupported actions (OOD actions) \\cite{dai2025ygq}. This effectively penalizes OOD values without impacting ID ones.\n    *   This value regularization reduces the generation of OOD responses during RL, thereby preventing overestimation caused by reward model extrapolation errors \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel OOD Detection**: Proposes using the next-token distribution from the reward training dataset to characterize the ID region and detect OOD responses for reward prediction \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n    *   **Behavior-Supported Policy Optimization (BSPO) Algorithm**: Introduces the first method that uses value regularization to address reward over-optimization, specifically designed to penalize OOD values without affecting ID ones \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n    *   **Theoretical Guarantees**: Proves that the behavior-supported Bellman operator is a $\\gamma$-contraction, guaranteeing convergence to a unique fixed point. It also proves that BSPO guarantees monotonic improvement of the supported policy until convergence to the optimal behavior-supported policy \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n    *   **Lightweight Implementation**: Implements BSPO using a \"ScoreLM\" model, which combines the original language model head for next-token prediction and a new score head for reward prediction, enabling efficient prediction of both rewards and behavior distributions \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   Extensive experiments were conducted to demonstrate BSPO's effectiveness \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n    *   **OOD Detection Efficacy**: Empirical results (Figure 1c) show that as policy iterates, the proportion of unsupported responses increases, and the proxy reward model's predictive accuracy significantly drops for these unsupported (OOD) responses (from ~76% for supported to ~58% for unsupported), validating the OOD detection mechanism \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n    *   **Performance Metrics**: BSPO was evaluated against baselines in preventing reward over-optimization due to OOD evaluation and in finding the optimal ID policy \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n    *   **Comparison Results**: Empirical results show that BSPO consistently **outperforms baselines** in these key metrics, effectively mitigating reward over-optimization and guiding the policy towards optimal solutions within the ID region \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n    *   **ScoreLM Validation**: The ScoreLM model's prediction accuracy was shown to be comparable to standard reward models across different scales on the test set (Figure 2b), confirming its viability for the proposed method \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   The method relies on a well-pretrained LLM for next-token prediction to define the behavior policy and detect OOD actions \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n    *   The paper notes that methods aimed at enhancing the generalization of reward models (e.g., through larger models or datasets) are complementary and can be combined with BSPO, implying that BSPO does not entirely negate the need for robust reward modeling but rather provides a mechanism to handle its inherent limitations \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n    *   The scope of applicability is primarily within RLHF for LLMs, specifically addressing the reward over-optimization problem caused by OOD evaluation.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   BSPO significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by being the **first method to use value regularization** to address reward over-optimization in RLHF \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n    *   It provides a principled way to **restrict policy search to the ID region** of the reward model, preventing extrapolation errors without conservatively limiting exploration within the valid region \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n    *   The **strong theoretical guarantees** (monotonic improvement, convergence to optimal behavior-supported policy) provide a robust foundation for its effectiveness \\cite{dai2025ygq}.\n    *   Its ability to effectively handle OOD responses while preserving unbiased evaluation for ID actions has significant potential impact on future research in aligning LLMs with human preferences, leading to more stable and reliable RLHF processes \\cite{dai2025ygq}.",

While generalizable to other RL-based alignment scenarios, the specific privacy accounting and PPO modifications are tailored to this context.\n\n*   **7. Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art**: `\\cite{wu2023pjz}` initiates and provides the first comprehensive DP framework for the critical and widely adopted LLM alignment stage, significantly advancing the technical state-of-the-art in privacy-preserving LLM development.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: This work paves the way for deploying LLMs that can continuously learn from user feedback without compromising individual privacy, fostering trust and broader adoption. It opens new research avenues in privacy-preserving RL for LLMs, including more sophisticated privacy accounting for complex PPO settings, advanced composition for multi-stage contributions, and exploring the interplay of model size with privacy-utility trade-offs.",

This makes it difficult to understand *why* an RM assigns a certain score, leading to issues like \"reward hacking\" where LLMs generate high-reward responses that do not align with actual human preferences \\cite{wang20247pw}. A notable example is the verbosity bias, where RMs favor longer responses regardless of quality \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: Interpretability is crucial for RMs to act as reliable proxies for human preferences, ensuring their internal decision processes are consistent with human values and preventing undesirable behaviors in aligned LLMs. The challenge lies in designing RMs that can provide transparent, decomposable explanations for their scores and be steerable to mitigate biases \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: The work operates within the standard RLHF framework, where RMs are essential for aligning LLMs. It builds upon existing multi-objective reward models that attempt to capture complex human preferences \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   Traditional RMs based on the Bradley-Terry (BT) model are limited in capturing complex, intransitive human preferences \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n        *   Existing multi-objective RMs typically rely on naive methods like fixed linear combinations to integrate multi-dimensional signals, which are too rigid for diverse contexts \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n        *   Black-box RMs are susceptible to reward hacking, such as the verbosity bias \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes a novel two-stage approach:\n        1.  **Absolute-Rating Multi-Objective Reward Model (ArmoRM)**: An RM is trained using multi-dimensional *absolute-rating* data, where each dimension corresponds to a human-interpretable objective (e.g., helpfulness, correctness, verbosity, safety). This model uses a pre-trained decoder-only LLM backbone with a linear regression layer, trained with regression loss on `k`-dimensional rating vectors \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n        2.  **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Scalarization**: A gating network is employed to automatically select and weight the most suitable reward objectives based on the *context* (prompt `x`). This gating layer is a shallow MLP that outputs non-negative coefficients (summing to 1) for the reward objectives, dynamically scalarizing the multi-objective rewards into a single score \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   Utilizes fine-grained, multi-dimensional *absolute ratings* instead of binarized pairwise *relative ratings*, preserving richer preference information \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n        *   Introduces a dynamic, context-conditioned MoE gating mechanism for scalarizing multi-objective rewards, allowing for flexible and steerable preference modeling, unlike rigid fixed linear combinations \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n        *   Incorporates a specific mechanism to mitigate verbosity bias by adjusting each reward objective to ensure zero Spearman correlation with the verbosity objective \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**:\n        *   **ArmoRM**: A multi-objective reward modeling framework that leverages absolute-rating data to provide interpretable, decomposable reward scores \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n        *   **MoE Scalarization**: A novel method for dynamically weighting and combining multiple reward objectives based on the input prompt, enhancing context-awareness and steerability of the RM \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n        *   **Verbosity Bias Mitigation**: A practical technique to decorrelate reward objectives from verbosity, directly addressing a common reward hacking problem \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: An efficient architecture that integrates a shallow MLP gating layer on top of an LLM backbone, leveraging prompt features for dynamic objective weighting without significant inference overhead \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**:\n        *   An ArmoRM was trained using a Llama-3 8B backbone, initialized from a Bradley-Terry RM, and a linear regression layer for 19 objectives from 8 datasets \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n        *   A MoE gating layer (3-hidden layer ReLU MLP) was trained on top of the frozen ArmoRM using Bradley-Terry loss on 10 pairwise preference datasets, with Spearman correlation used for verbosity bias correction \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n        *   The model, ArmoRM-Llama3-8B, was evaluated on RewardBench, a comprehensive benchmark for RMs \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   **Metric**: Weighted average accuracy (overall score) on RewardBench, covering categories like Chat, Chat Hard, Safety, Reasoning, and Prior Sets \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n        *   **Results**:\n            *   ArmoRM-Llama3-8B achieved state-of-the-art performance with an overall score of 89.0 on RewardBench \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n            *   It significantly outperformed the Llama-3 8B Bradley-Terry RM (83.6) \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n            *   It surpassed LLM-as-a-judge methods using GPT-4 Turbo (84.2) and GPT-4o (83.3) by a considerable margin \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n            *   Remarkably, the 8B parameter ArmoRM model achieved performance nearly on par with the much larger Nemotron-4 340B RM (89.3) \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The approach relies on the availability of high-quality, multi-dimensional absolute-rating data for training the ArmoRM \\cite{wang20247pw}.

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the primary method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. The RLHF process typically starts by training a reward model (RM) using human preference data. Conventional RMs are trained on pairwise responses to the same user request, with relative ratings indicating which response humans prefer. The trained RM serves as a proxy for human preferences. However, due to the black-box nature of RMs, their outputs lack interpretability, as humans cannot intuitively understand why an RM thinks a response is good or not. As RMs act as human preference proxies, we believe they should be human-interpretable to ensure that their internal decision processes are consistent with human preferences and to prevent reward hacking in LLM alignment. To build RMs with interpretable preferences, we propose a two-stage approach: i) train an Absolute-Rating Multi-Objective Reward Model (ArmoRM) with multi-dimensional absolute-rating data, each dimension corresponding to a human-interpretable objective (e.g., honesty, verbosity, safety); ii) employ a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) strategy with a gating network that automatically selects the most suitable reward objectives based on the context. We efficiently trained an ArmoRM with Llama-3 8B and a gating network consisting of a shallow MLP on top of the ArmoRM.

      "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \"Interpretable Preferences via Multi-Objective Reward Modeling and Mixture-of-Experts\" \\cite{wang20247pw} for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Conventional Reward Models (RMs) in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are black-box, lacking interpretability. This makes it difficult to understand *why* an RM assigns a certain score, leading to issues like \"reward hacking\" where LLMs generate high-reward responses that do not align with actual human preferences \\cite{wang20247pw}. A notable example is the verbosity bias, where RMs favor longer responses regardless of quality \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: Interpretability is crucial for RMs to act as reliable proxies for human preferences, ensuring their internal decision processes are consistent with human values and preventing undesirable behaviors in aligned LLMs. The challenge lies in designing RMs that can provide transparent, decomposable explanations for their scores and be steerable to mitigate biases \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: The work operates within the standard RLHF framework, where RMs are essential for aligning LLMs. It builds upon existing multi-objective reward models that attempt to capture complex human preferences \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   Traditional RMs based on the Bradley-Terry (BT) model are limited in capturing complex, intransitive human preferences \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n        *   Existing multi-objective RMs typically rely on naive methods like fixed linear combinations to integrate multi-dimensional signals, which are too rigid for diverse contexts \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n        *   Black-box RMs are susceptible to reward hacking, such as the verbosity bias \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes a novel two-stage approach:\n        1.  **Absolute-Rating Multi-Objective Reward Model (ArmoRM)**: An RM is trained using multi-dimensional *absolute-rating* data, where each dimension corresponds to a human-interpretable objective (e.g., helpfulness, correctness, verbosity, safety). This model uses a pre-trained decoder-only LLM backbone with a linear regression layer, trained with regression loss on `k`-dimensional rating vectors \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n        2.  **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Scalarization**: A gating network is employed to automatically select and weight the most suitable reward objectives based on the *context* (prompt `x`). This gating layer is a shallow MLP that outputs non-negative coefficients (summing to 1) for the reward objectives, dynamically scalarizing the multi-objective rewards into a single score \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   Utilizes fine-grained, multi-dimensional *absolute ratings* instead of binarized pairwise *relative ratings*, preserving richer preference information \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n        *   Introduces a dynamic, context-conditioned MoE gating mechanism for scalarizing multi-objective rewards, allowing for flexible and steerable preference modeling, unlike rigid fixed linear combinations \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n        *   Incorporates a specific mechanism to mitigate verbosity bias by adjusting each reward objective to ensure zero Spearman correlation with the verbosity objective \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**:\n        *   **ArmoRM**: A multi-objective reward modeling framework that leverages absolute-rating data to provide interpretable, decomposable reward scores \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n        *   **MoE Scalarization**: A novel method for dynamically weighting and combining multiple reward objectives based on the input prompt, enhancing context-awareness and steerability of the RM \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n        *   **Verbosity Bias Mitigation**: A practical technique to decorrelate reward objectives from verbosity, directly addressing a common reward hacking problem \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: An efficient architecture that integrates a shallow MLP gating layer on top of an LLM backbone, leveraging prompt features for dynamic objective weighting without significant inference overhead \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**:\n        *   An ArmoRM was trained using a Llama-3 8B backbone, initialized from a Bradley-Terry RM, and a linear regression layer for 19 objectives from 8 datasets \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n        *   A MoE gating layer (3-hidden layer ReLU MLP) was trained on top of the frozen ArmoRM using Bradley-Terry loss on 10 pairwise preference datasets, with Spearman correlation used for verbosity bias correction \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n        *   The model, ArmoRM-Llama3-8B, was evaluated on RewardBench, a comprehensive benchmark for RMs \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   **Metric**: Weighted average accuracy (overall score) on RewardBench, covering categories like Chat, Chat Hard, Safety, Reasoning, and Prior Sets \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n        *   **Results**:\n            *   ArmoRM-Llama3-8B achieved state-of-the-art performance with an overall score of 89.0 on RewardBench \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n            *   It significantly outperformed the Llama-3 8B Bradley-Terry RM (83.6) \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n            *   It surpassed LLM-as-a-judge methods using GPT-4 Turbo (84.2) and GPT-4o (83.3) by a considerable margin \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n            *   Remarkably, the 8B parameter ArmoRM model achieved performance nearly on par with the much larger Nemotron-4 340B RM (89.3) \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The approach relies on the availability of high-quality, multi-dimensional absolute-rating data for training the ArmoRM \\cite{wang20247pw}. The effectiveness of verbosity bias mitigation depends on the chosen correlation metric and reference data distribution \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The method is primarily focused on enhancing the interpretability and steerability of reward models for LLM alignment within the RLHF framework \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art**: The proposed ArmoRM with MoE scalarization achieves state-of-the-art performance on RewardBench, demonstrating a significant advancement in reward modeling for LLMs \\cite{wang20247pw}. Its ability to match much larger models with fewer parameters highlights its efficiency \\cite{wang20247pw}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: This work provides a robust framework for building interpretable and steerable RMs, which is critical for mitigating reward hacking and ensuring robust alignment of LLMs with complex human preferences. It opens avenues for future research into fine-grained control over LLM behavior and more transparent AI alignment processes \\cite{wang20247pw}. The model's strong performance also suggests it could serve as a more cost-effective and accurate alternative to LLM-as-a-judge methods \\cite{wang20247pw}.",

The core question is: \"Is online RL necessary for AI alignment?\"\n    *   **Importance and Challenge:** RLHF is the canonical framework for LLM alignment.

Data coverage and quality hypotheses were empirically disproven as primary explanations (Figures 4, 5). A significant finding was the inverse correlation between classification accuracy and generative quality for offline vs. online policies (Figures 6, 7, 8).

    "intriguing_abstract": "Is online Reinforcement Learning truly indispensable for Large Language Model (LLM) alignment, or can simpler offline methods suffice? This foundational question in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) remains hotly debated. We present a systematic empirical investigation, using a controlled IPO loss framework and KL divergence budget, to dissect the performance gap between online and offline alignment algorithms. Our findings unequivocally demonstrate that online methods consistently achieve superior peak performance and a better trade-off between policy optimization and alignment. Crucially, we uncover a novel, inverse relationship: offline algorithms optimize policies for strong pairwise classification but yield weaker generative capabilities, while online methods excel at generation but are less discriminative. This fundamental interplay, profoundly shaped by on-policy sampling, persists across various loss functions and model scales, disproving common hypotheses about data coverage or quality. Our work highlights the pivotal role of on-policy interaction in achieving high-quality LLM generation and poses a significant challenge for future offline alignment research, urging the development of methods that bridge this critical discriminative-generative divide.",

However, rising popularity in offline alignment algorithms challenge the need for on-policy sampling in RLHF. Within the context of reward over-optimization, we start with an opening set of experiments that demonstrate the clear advantage of online methods over offline methods. This prompts us to investigate the causes to the performance discrepancy through a series of carefully designed experimental ablations. We show empirically that hypotheses such as offline data coverage and data quality by itself cannot convincingly explain the performance difference. We also find that while offline algorithms train policy to become good at pairwise classification, it is worse at generations; in the meantime the policies trained by online algorithms are good at generations while worse at pairwise classification. This hints at a unique interplay between discriminative and generative capabilities, which is greatly impacted by the sampling process. Lastly, we observe that the performance discrepancy persists for both contrastive and non-contrastive loss functions, and appears not to be addressed by simply scaling up policy networks. Taken together, our study sheds light on the pivotal role of on-policy sampling in AI alignment, and hints at certain fundamental challenges of offline alignment algorithms.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents an advanced mathematical problem-solving framework, LLaMA-Berry, for enhancing the mathematical reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with iterative Self-Refine to optimize the reasoning path and utilizes a pairwise reward model to evaluate different paths globally. By leveraging the self-critic and rewriting capabilities of LLMs, Self-Refine applied to MCTS (SR-MCTS) overcomes the inefficiencies and limitations of conventional step-wise and greedy search algorithms by fostering a more efficient exploration of solution spaces. Pairwise Preference Reward Model~(PPRM), inspired by Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), is then used to model pairwise preferences between solutions, utilizing an Enhanced Borda Count (EBC) method to synthesize these preferences into a global ranking score to find better answers. This approach addresses the challenges of scoring variability and non-independent distributions in mathematical reasoning tasks. The framework has been tested on general and advanced benchmarks, showing superior performance in terms of search efficiency and problem-solving capability compared to existing methods like ToT and rStar, particularly in complex Olympiad-level benchmarks, including GPQA, AIME24 and AMC23.",

Existing alignment methods are either complex, resource-intensive training-time approaches (e.g., SFT, RLHF) or ineffective inference-time methods that significantly degrade performance on downstream tasks.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge**: Ensuring LLM harmlessness is crucial for safe and reliable deployment, especially for customized, domain-specific models. The challenge lies in achieving strong alignment efficiently (without extensive retraining) and without compromising the model's core capabilities.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches**:\n        *   **Training-time alignment**: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are effective but involve complex, resource-intensive training processes and require diverse datasets.\n        *   **Inference-time alignment**:\n            *   Prompt-based methods (e.g., adding alignment prompts, self-reminder, goal priority) are simple but often perform poorly in alignment and negatively impact downstream task performance.\n            *   Activation engineering methods (e.g., ITI, RepE) identify and shift activations along specific directions (e.g., \"truthful\" or \"honest\" vectors) extracted from the *target model itself*.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Training-time methods are cumbersome. Existing inference-time methods are either weak (prompt-based) or not specifically designed for harmlessness alignment using cross-model knowledge transfer (activation engineering). Previous activation engineering methods typically extract steering vectors from the *target model itself* and apply shifts unconditionally, potentially affecting utility.\n    *   **Positioning**: InferAligner introduces a novel inference-time alignment method that leverages *cross-model guidance* and *conditional intervention* to achieve robust harmlessness without retraining and while preserving utility, addressing the limitations of both training-time and prior inference-time approaches. It is the first to apply activation engineering for harmlessness alignment using cross-model guidance.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: InferAligner operates at inference time by modifying the target model's activations using \"Safety Steering Vectors\" (SSVs) derived from a separate, already safety-aligned model.\n        1.  **Safety Related Vector (SRV) Extraction**: SRVs are calculated as the mean difference in last-token activations between harmful and harmless prompts from a dataset.\n        2.  **Safety Steering Vector (SSV) Generation**: Crucially, SSVs are *SRVs extracted from a safety-aligned model* (e.g., LLaMA2-CHAT). This transfers \"safety knowledge\" from an expert model.\n        3.  **Guidance Gate**: During inference, the target model's own SRVs are used to determine if the input instruction has harmful intent. A guidance gate `gl` (binary signal) is activated only if the input is classified as harmful (`al(P)Tsl + bl > 0`).

      "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) rapidly evolve, they are increasingly being customized through fine-tuning to suit the specific needs of various applications. A critical aspect of this advancement is the alignment process, which ensures that these models perform tasks in ways that align with human values and expectations. Current alignment methods, such as direct preference optimization (DPO) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), focus primarily on alignment during training phase. However, these methods often involve complex and resource-intensive training processes, posing significant challenge for their implementation. Therefore, we propose InferAligner, a simple yet effective method for harmlessness alignment during inference phase. InferAligner decouples harmlessness from helpfulness. During the training phase, it focuses solely on enhancing the target model’s capabilities on downstream tasks. In the inference phase, it utilizes safety steering vectors extracted from the aligned model to guide the target model towards harmlessness alignment. Experimental results show that our method can be very effectively applied to domain-specific models in finance, medicine, and mathematics, as well as to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) such as LLaVA. It significantly diminishes the attack success rate (ASR) of both harmful instructions and jailbreak instructions, while maintaining almost unchanged performance in downstream tasks.",

Existing alignment methods are either complex, resource-intensive training-time approaches (e.g., SFT, RLHF) or ineffective inference-time methods that significantly degrade performance on downstream tasks.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge**: Ensuring LLM harmlessness is crucial for safe and reliable deployment, especially for customized, domain-specific models. The challenge lies in achieving strong alignment efficiently (without extensive retraining) and without compromising the model's core capabilities.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches**:\n        *   **Training-time alignment**: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are effective but involve complex, resource-intensive training processes and require diverse datasets.\n        *   **Inference-time alignment**:\n            *   Prompt-based methods (e.g., adding alignment prompts, self-reminder, goal priority) are simple but often perform poorly in alignment and negatively impact downstream task performance.\n            *   Activation engineering methods (e.g., ITI, RepE) identify and shift activations along specific directions (e.g., \"truthful\" or \"honest\" vectors) extracted from the *target model itself*.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Training-time methods are cumbersome. Existing inference-time methods are either weak (prompt-based) or not specifically designed for harmlessness alignment using cross-model knowledge transfer (activation engineering). Previous activation engineering methods typically extract steering vectors from the *target model itself* and apply shifts unconditionally, potentially affecting utility.\n    *   **Positioning**: InferAligner introduces a novel inference-time alignment method that leverages *cross-model guidance* and *conditional intervention* to achieve robust harmlessness without retraining and while preserving utility, addressing the limitations of both training-time and prior inference-time approaches. It is the first to apply activation engineering for harmlessness alignment using cross-model guidance.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: InferAligner operates at inference time by modifying the target model's activations using \"Safety Steering Vectors\" (SSVs) derived from a separate, already safety-aligned model.\n        1.  **Safety Related Vector (SRV) Extraction**: SRVs are calculated as the mean difference in last-token activations between harmful and harmless prompts from a dataset.\n        2.  **Safety Steering Vector (SSV) Generation**: Crucially, SSVs are *SRVs extracted from a safety-aligned model* (e.g., LLaMA2-CHAT). This transfers \"safety knowledge\" from an expert model.\n        3.  **Guidance Gate**: During inference, the target model's own SRVs are used to determine if the input instruction has harmful intent. A guidance gate `gl` (binary signal) is activated only if the input is classified as harmful (`al(P)Tsl + bl > 0`). This ensures selective intervention.\n        4.  **Conditional Activation Shift**: If the guidance gate is active (harmful intent detected), the SSVs (from the aligned model) are added to the target model's activations across all token positions in selected transformer layers (`xl = x'l + α · gl · θl`). `α` controls intervention strength, and `bl` is a bias for the intent boundary.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   **Cross-Model Guidance**: Unlike previous activation engineering methods that derive steering vectors from the target model itself, InferAligner extracts SSVs from a *separate, pre-aligned safety model*, effectively transferring safety knowledge.\n        *   **Conditional Intervention (Guidance Gate)**: The method only intervenes when harmful intent is detected, preventing unnecessary shifts that could degrade performance on benign tasks. This is a significant improvement over unconditional activation shifts.\n        *   **Inference-Time & Training-Free**: Achieves strong alignment without any fine-tuning of the target model, making it highly efficient and adaptable.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions** \\cite{wang2024w7p}\n    *   **Novel Algorithm**: Introduction of InferAligner, an inference-time alignment method that effectively enhances model safety while maintaining downstream performance.\n    *   **Cross-Model Guidance Mechanism**: Proposing the use of Safety Steering Vectors (SSVs) extracted from a safety-aligned model to guide the activations of an unaligned target model.\n    *   **Conditional Intervention**: Development of a guidance gate that selectively applies activation shifts only when harmful intent is detected, preserving model utility.\n    *   **Applicability to MLLMs**: First exploration of harmlessness alignment for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) using activation engineering.\n    *   **Dataset Contribution**: Creation of MM-Harmful Bench, the first multimodal dataset specifically for safety research.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**:\n        *   Evaluated harmlessness and utility on domain-specific LLMs (finance, medicine, mathematics) fine-tuned from LLaMA2-7B.\n        *   Evaluated harmlessness on a Multimodal LLM (LLaVA-v1.5).\n        *   Compared against strong baselines including training-time (DS-LLaMA2-CHAT, DS-LLaMA2+Safety SFT) and inference-time (DS-LLaMA2+Self-Reminder, DS-LLaMA2+Goal Priority) methods.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**:\n        *   **Harmfulness**: Attack Success Rate (ASR), measured by GPT-3.5 turbo (for LLMs) and GPT-4V (for MLLMs) as judgment models.

Additionally, DPO discards the state-value function, which has been shown to improve reasoning capabilities, but reintroducing it typically requires additional annotated data or complex reinforcement learning.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **DPO Limitations**: While DPO simplifies RLHF by using an implicit reward model, it relies on solution-level preferences, which are insufficient for multi-step reasoning, and discards the value model.\n    *   **Previous Math LLMs**: Most existing work improves mathematical reasoning through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on high-quality *positive* supervision data (correct solutions), often wasting negative examples and not teaching the model *why* solutions are wrong.\n    *   **Value Models**: Some prior work has shown the effectiveness of value models in improving reasoning, but they often require additional annotated data or complex RL processes (e.g., PPO), which SVPO aims to avoid.\n    *   **Positioning**: \\cite{chen20244ev} introduces SVPO as a novel preference learning framework that addresses the limitations of solution-level preferences by generating and leveraging *step-level* preferences, and integrates an explicit value model without requiring additional human or GPT-4 annotations.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Method**: Step-level Value Preference Optimization (SVPO) combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for automatic step-level preference annotation with a novel preference learning objective that integrates an explicit value model.\n    *   **Step-level Preference Annotation via MCTS**:\n        *   MCTS is employed to autonomously explore multi-step reasoning paths and generate step-level preferences.\n        *   Q-values at each node (step) in the MCTS tree indicate potential reasoning errors, providing fine-grained feedback.\n        *   This process avoids labor-intensive human or GPT-4 annotation and aligns preferences with the LLM's current capabilities.\n    *   **Step-level Preference Learning (SVPO Loss)**:\n        *   Maintains three models: a policy model ($\\pi$), a reference policy model ($\\pi'$), and a lightweight explicit value model ($V_\\phi$) implemented as an auxiliary value head over the policy model.\n        *   **Pre-training**: Uses a multi-task loss combining standard SFT with an MSE loss for the value head, where the value labels are derived from MCTS Q-values or final rewards.\n        *   **SVPO Loss Function**: Comprises three objectives:\n            1.  A DPO-like loss applied to the automatically generated step-level preference data.\n            2.  A margin loss for value preference learning, encouraging the value of preferred steps to be higher by a margin $\\gamma$.\n            3.  A regularization term (adapted MSE loss) to align the scale of the implicit reward (from DPO) with the explicit value model's output, preventing model degeneration.\n    *   **Step-level Inference**: The trained value model is seamlessly integrated with Step-level Beam Search (SBS) to efficiently select preferred solution paths during inference, incurring lower computational cost than MCTS.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithm**: Introduction of Step-level Value Preference Optimization (SVPO) for fine-grained preference learning in multi-step reasoning.\n    *   **Automatic Annotation**: Pioneering use of MCTS to *autonomously* generate step-level preference annotations and identify potential reasoning errors via Q-values, eliminating the need for costly human or GPT-4 supervision.\n    *   **Integrated Value Model**: A lightweight explicit value model is integrated into the DPO framework, trained directly from MCTS-derived Q-values and step-level preferences, without requiring additional external annotations.\n    *   **Preference Alignment**: A novel regularization term in the SVPO loss ensures scale alignment between the implicit reward model and the explicit value model.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Datasets**: Evaluated on in-domain (GSM8K, MATH) and out-of-domain (GaoKao2023, OCW-Courses) mathematical reasoning benchmarks.\n    *   **Base Models**: Applied to DeepseekMath-Base-7B and Llama3.\n    *   **Baselines**: Compared against state-of-the-art commercial models (GPT-4, ChatGPT) and fine-tuned open-source LLMs (e.g., DeepSeekMath-Instruct, AlphaMath, MARIO, MAmmoTH, ToRA), often using Chain of Thought (CoT) or Program-Aided Language (PAL).\n    *   **Key Results**:\n        *   SVPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average improvement of 5.3% / 3.7% over AlphaMath with SBS.\n        *   On challenging out-of-domain datasets, SVPO shows substantial gains, e.g., +16.2% over DeepSeekMath-Instruct on OCW-Courses with greedy decoding.\n        *   With Step-level Beam Search (SBS), SVPO further improves performance, demonstrating the value model's effectiveness in guiding reasoning paths.\n        *   Achieves comparable or even superior results to GPT-4 on 7B LLMs, highlighting its efficiency.\n        *   Experiments confirm that MCTS provides useful step-level preferences, step-level preferences enhance reasoning more than solution-level ones, and the value model effectively guides policy learning.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Performance on GSM8K**: The method slightly lags on GSM8K, potentially due to its focus on single-step solutions and less logical reasoning, and the limited diversity of the autonomously generated training data (56k vs. 776k for DeepSeekMath).\n    *   **Scope**: Primarily focused on mathematical reasoning, but the principles of step-level preference optimization and MCTS-based annotation could be applicable to other complex multi-step reasoning tasks.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances Preference Learning**: Moves beyond coarse solution-level preferences to fine-grained step-level feedback, which is crucial for complex reasoning tasks.\n    *   **Efficient Training**: Provides a method to train LLMs for multi-step reasoning more effectively and efficiently by autonomously generating high-quality, fine-grained supervision without human or external model annotation.\n    *   **Enhanced Reasoning**: Demonstrates that integrating an explicit value model, trained on self-explored step-level preferences, significantly enhances an LLM's ability to navigate complex reasoning paths and achieve state-of-the-art performance.\n    *   **Future Research**: Opens avenues for exploring self-exploration and fine-grained preference learning in other domains requiring multi-step reasoning.",

Leveraging this insight, DeRa employs an autoregressive approximation to linearly combine the logits of a reference (e.g., SFT) model and an aligned model at decoding time, controlled by a single parameter λ. This innovation drastically reduces the computational burden of hyperparameter tuning, offering real-time control over the critical reward-regularization trade-off. Our experiments across summarization, hallucination mitigation, and dialogue tasks show DeRa effectively mirrors the performance of fully retrained models, significantly accelerating research and deployment of robust, preference-aligned LMs. DeRa offers unprecedented flexibility, transforming how we fine-tune and deploy aligned language models.",

Alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), are typically cast as optimizing a tradeoff between human preference rewards and a proximity regularization term that encourages staying close to the unaligned model. Selecting an appropriate level of regularization is critical: insufficient regularization can lead to reduced model capabilities due to reward hacking, whereas excessive regularization hinders alignment. Traditional methods for finding the optimal regularization level require retraining multiple models with varying regularization strengths. This process, however, is resource-intensive, especially for large models.

This often leads to responses clustered around local optima, causing overfitting and premature convergence, leaving potentially high-reward regions unexplored in the nearly infinite space of natural language.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** This work builds upon and contrasts with existing RLHF and DPO methods, particularly in online alignment settings. It relates to general active exploration strategies in reinforcement learning.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n        *   Offline alignment methods struggle to manually construct diverse responses that adequately span the vast language space.\n        *   Existing online RLHF and DPO methods passively explore, relying solely on sampling randomness, which can lead to models getting stuck in local optima and overfitting to current data.\n        *   Most active exploration methods in general RL (e.g., uncertainty estimation via UCB or ensembles) are often computationally intractable or inefficient for LLMs.\n    *   **Positioning:** \\cite{zhang2024lqf} proposes an *optimism-based active exploration* method for online direct alignment. Unlike prior active exploration work that explicitly estimates uncertainty (e.g., using ensembles of reward models), SELM bypasses this computational overhead by directly biasing the model towards potentially high-reward regions. It also specifically addresses and mitigates a limitation of DPO: its indiscriminate favoring of unseen extrapolations.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper proposes a bilevel optimization objective that is optimistically biased towards potentially high-reward responses. This objective is formulated within an online direct alignment framework, eliminating the need for a separate reward model (RM).\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:**\n        *   **Optimistically Biased Objective:** Introduces an optimism term `α max_π E_{y~π, y'~π_ref} [r(x, y) - r(x, y')]` into the reward-fitting objective, coupled with a KL-divergence constraint `β D_KL(π||π_ref)`.

      "abstract": "Preference optimization, particularly through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), has achieved significant success in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to adhere to human intentions. Unlike offline alignment with a fixed dataset, online feedback collection from humans or AI on model generations typically leads to more capable reward models and better-aligned LLMs through an iterative process. However, achieving a globally accurate reward model requires systematic exploration to generate diverse responses that span the vast space of natural language. Random sampling from standard reward-maximizing LLMs alone is insufficient to fulfill this requirement. To address this issue, we propose a bilevel objective optimistically biased towards potentially high-reward responses to actively explore out-of-distribution regions. By solving the inner-level problem with the reparameterized reward function, the resulting algorithm, named Self-Exploring Language Models (SELM), eliminates the need for a separate RM and iteratively updates the LLM with a straightforward objective. Compared to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), the SELM objective reduces indiscriminate favor of unseen extrapolations and enhances exploration efficiency. Our experimental results demonstrate that when fine-tuned on Zephyr-7B-SFT and Llama-3-8B-Instruct models, SELM significantly boosts the performance on instruction-following benchmarks such as MT-Bench and AlpacaEval 2.0, as well as various standard academic benchmarks in different settings.

Our experiments on the Pick-a-Pic dataset reveal that SPIN-Diffusion outperforms the existing supervised fine-tuning method in aspects of human preference alignment and visual appeal right from its first iteration. By the second iteration, it exceeds the performance of RLHF-based methods across all metrics, achieving these results with less data.",

This is framed as a general-sum minimax game where a \"main player\" (the current model) learns to differentiate between real data and samples generated by an \"opponent player\" (a previous model version) \\cite{yuan2024jp7}.\n    *   **Novelty/Differences**:\n        *   **Data Efficiency**: Eliminates the need for paired human preference data, requiring only single high-quality image-text pairs for fine-tuning \\cite{yuan2024jp7}.\n        *   **Adaptation for Diffusion Models**: Addresses two key challenges in applying self-play to diffusion models:\n            1.  **Trajectory Complexity**: Diffusion models generate images through numerous intermediate steps. `\\cite{yuan2024jp7}` designs an objective function that considers *all intermediate images* generated during the reverse sampling process, not just the final image \\cite{yuan2024jp7}.\n            2.  **Score Function Parameterization**: Diffusion models are parameterized by score functions (gradients of probabilities), unlike LLMs which use direct probabilities. `\\cite{yuan2024jp7}` overcomes this by decomposing and approximating the probability function step-by-step into products related to the score function \\cite{yuan2024jp7}.\n        *   **Technical Enhancements**: Employs Gaussian reparameterization from DDIM to support advanced sampling methods and derives an unbiased objective function calculable from intermediate samples. For computational efficiency, an approximate objective function is also proposed \\cite{yuan2024jp7}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithm**: Introduction of SPIN-Diffusion, a self-play mechanism for iteratively improving diffusion models towards a target distribution \\cite{yuan2024jp7}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights**: `\\cite{yuan2024jp7}` theoretically proves that the model achieved by SPIN-Diffusion cannot be further improved by standard SFT, and its stationary point aligns with the target data distribution \\cite{yuan2024jp7}.\n    *   **Methodological Innovations**: Development of a decomposed objective function that leverages the full diffusion trajectory (x0:T) and relates it to the score function, making the self-play mechanism computationally feasible for diffusion models \\cite{yuan2024jp7}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Evaluated on text-to-image generation tasks using the Pick-a-Pic dataset, with Stable Diffusion v1.5 as the base model \\cite{yuan2024jp7}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**: Human preference alignment, visual appeal, PickScore, and Aesthetic score \\cite{yuan2024jp7}.\n    *   **Comparison Results**:\n        *   **First Iteration**: SPIN-Diffusion \"surpasses SFT from the very first iteration\" \\cite{yuan2024jp7}.\n        *   **Second Iteration**: It \"exceeds the performance of RLHF-based methods across all metrics,\" including Diffusion-DPO (which uses 'loser' samples), achieving these results with less data \\cite{yuan2024jp7}.\n        *   **Third Iteration**: Images generated by SPIN-Diffusion achieved a higher PickScore than the base SD-1.5 model 79.8% of the time and a superior Aesthetic score 88.4% of the time \\cite{yuan2024jp7}.\n    *   **Efficiency**: Demonstrates \"exceptional efficiency in dataset utilization\" compared to current state-of-the-art fine-tuning algorithms, even against models trained with more extensive data \\cite{yuan2024jp7}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The paper implicitly assumes the availability of a \"high-quality dataset containing image-text pairs (c,x0)\" \\cite{yuan2024jp7}. While an approximate objective function is proposed for efficiency, potential trade-offs are not explicitly detailed as limitations in the provided text.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: SPIN-Diffusion is particularly beneficial for users with \"restricted access to datasets containing multiple images per prompt,\" offering a useful tool for fine-tuning on custom datasets where only a single image per text prompt is provided \\cite{yuan2024jp7}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement**: `\\cite{yuan2024jp7}` significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in diffusion model fine-tuning by introducing a self-play mechanism that achieves superior performance and alignment without the need for costly paired human preference data \\cite{yuan2024jp7}. It provides a powerful alternative to existing SFT and RL-based fine-tuning strategies \\cite{yuan2024jp7}.\n    *   **Potential Impact**: This work broadens the applicability of advanced diffusion models, enabling effective fine-tuning on a wider range of datasets, especially those with limited or single-image-per-prompt data. It also highlights the potential of self-play mechanisms for iterative self-improvement in generative AI beyond LLMs \\cite{yuan2024jp7}.",

      "abstract": "While humans can flexibly leverage interactive visual cognition for complex problem-solving, enabling Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to learn similarly adaptive behaviors with visual tools remains challenging. A significant hurdle is the current lack of standardized infrastructure, which hinders integrating diverse tools, generating rich interaction data, and training robust agents effectively. To address these gaps, we introduce OpenThinkIMG, the first open-source, comprehensive end-to-end framework for tool-augmented LVLMs. It features standardized vision tool interfaces, scalable trajectory generation for policy initialization, and a flexible training environment. Furthermore, considering supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on static demonstrations offers limited policy generalization for dynamic tool invocation, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework V-ToolRL to train LVLMs to learn adaptive policies for invoking external vision tools. V-ToolRL enables LVLMs to autonomously discover optimal tool-usage strategies by directly optimizing for task success using feedback from tool interactions. We empirically validate V-ToolRL on challenging chart reasoning tasks. Our RL-trained agent, built upon a Qwen2-VL-2B, significantly outperforms its SFT-initialized counterpart (+28.83 points) and surpasses established supervised tool-learning baselines like Taco and CogCom by an average of +12.7 points. Notably, it also surpasses prominent closed-source models like GPT-4.1 by +8.68 accuracy points.

Research Problem & Motivation**\n*   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the challenge of further improving human alignment in large language models (LLMs) beyond initial Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training. While DPO simplifies Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) by bypassing explicit reward model learning, it leaves an opportunity for iterative refinement.\n*   **Importance and Challenge**: Human alignment is crucial for LLM utility. Existing DPO methods often rely on fixed offline datasets, which can lead to suboptimal policies. Iterative DPO, which involves collecting new responses and re-training, is known to be more effective but typically requires costly external human or AI feedback. The challenge is to achieve this iterative improvement cheaply and without external feedback, while also mitigating issues like length exploitation and catastrophic forgetting.\n\n**2.

A recent groundbreaking work, direct preference optimization (DPO), has greatly simplified the process from past work in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) by bypassing the reward learning stage in RLHF. DPO, after training, provides an implicit reward model. In this work, we make a novel observation that this implicit reward model can by itself be used in a bootstrapping fashion to further align the LLM. Our approach is to use the rewards from a current LLM to construct a preference dataset, which is then used in subsequent DPO rounds. We incorporate two refinements to further improve our approach: 1) length-regularized reward shaping to make the preference dataset length-unbiased; 2) experience replay to enhance the quality of the preference dataset. Our approach, named self-alignment with DPO ImpliCit rEwards (DICE), shows great improvements in alignment. It achieves an increase of more than 8$\\\\%$ in lengthcontrolled win rate on AlpacaEval 2 for all the different base models that we tried, without relying on external feedback.

    "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \"How Likely Do LLMs with CoT Mimic Human Reasoning?\" by Bao et al. for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Chain-of-thought (CoT) is a widely used technique for Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform reasoning tasks, but it often fails to consistently improve performance or faithfully represent the LLM's actual reasoning process. The underlying mechanisms causing these inconsistencies and unfaithfulness are not well understood.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: Understanding *when* and *why* CoT issues occur is crucial for developing more reliable and genuinely reasoning LLMs. Existing research primarily focuses on superficial phenomena or enhancing reasoning, rather than diagnosing the fundamental causal relationships within the LLM's problem-solving process.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches**: Previous work includes various CoT prompting techniques (e.g., self-consistency, Tree-of-thought, Graph-of-thought) aimed at enhancing reasoning, and studies that identify or attempt to measure CoT unfaithfulness (e.g., Turpin et al., 2023; Lanham et al., 2023). Other research explores LLMs' causal reasoning capabilities on natural language variables (e.g., ATOMIC, CLadder).\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Existing CoT methods focus on improving or identifying issues at a behavioral level, not on the *underlying causal mechanism*. Studies on LLM causal reasoning typically examine causality between external, question-specific variables, not the internal components of the CoT process itself (instruction, reasoning steps, answer).\n    *   **Positioning**: This paper distinguishes itself by employing a *causal analysis* framework to diagnose the *internal mechanism* of CoT in LLMs, specifically investigating the causal relationships between the problem instruction, the generated CoT, and the final answer \\cite{bao2024wnc}. This approach aims to reveal latent structural causal models (SCMs) that explain observed behaviors like consistency errors.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper abstracts the LLM's problem-solving process into three random variables: Instruction (Z), CoT (X), and Answer (Y). It then uses *causal analysis* with *interventions* to infer the Structural Causal Model (SCM) for LLM-task pairs \\cite{bao2024wnc}. This involves testing two hypotheses: if CoT causes the Answer (given constant Instruction), and if Instruction causes the Answer (given constant CoT), using Average Treatment Effect (ATE) and McNemar's test.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**: The key innovation is the application of *causal inference* to the *internal components* of LLM reasoning, allowing for the identification of four distinct SCM types (Causal Chain, Common Cause, Full Connection, Isolation) that characterize different reasoning behaviors \\cite{bao2024wnc}. This framework differentiates between genuine \"reasoning\" (where the answer is derived from CoT) and \"explaining\" (where CoT is generated based on a latent belief of the answer), providing a deeper understanding of consistency and faithfulness issues.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**: Introduction of a novel causal analysis framework to diagnose the underlying SCMs of LLMs' reasoning processes by modeling Instruction, CoT, and Answer as causal variables \\cite{bao2024wnc}. This framework utilizes specific interventions (e.g., golden CoT, random CoT, random instruction, random bias) to infer causal links.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: Identification of four SCM types, revealing that LLMs often deviate from the ideal \"Causal Chain\" (human-like reasoning) towards \"Common Cause\" or \"Full Connection\" models, which indicate spurious correlations and \"explaining\" rather than true \"reasoning\" \\cite{bao2024wnc}. The study also provides empirical evidence that in-context learning (ICL) strengthens the ideal causal structure, while post-training techniques like supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) *weaken* it \\cite{bao2024wnc}. Furthermore, it surprisingly finds that increasing model size alone does not necessarily strengthen the ideal causal structure \\cite{bao2024wnc}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Experiments were performed on various LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, GPT-4, Llama2, Mistral) across six mathematical and logical reasoning tasks (Addition, Multiplication, GSM8K, ProofWriter, FOLIO, LogiQA) \\cite{bao2024wnc}. Interventions were applied to CoT (golden/random CoT) and Instruction (random instruction/bias) to test causal hypotheses. The influence of ICL, SFT, RLHF, and model size on the inferred SCMs was also investigated.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**: Accuracy was used to evaluate task performance, and Average Treatment Effect (ATE) with McNemar's test determined the statistical significance of causal relationships \\cite{bao2024wnc}. The study found that a significant portion of LLM-task pairs exhibited SCM types (II and III) indicative of spurious correlations and potential consistency errors. For instance, GPT-3.5-turbo showed ideal Type I SCM for GSM8K and FOLIO but Type II for Addition. Crucially, ICL was shown to strengthen the ideal causal structure, while SFT and RLHF were found to weaken it. Model size alone did not guarantee a stronger ideal causal structure \\cite{bao2024wnc}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The study focuses on the basic chain-of-thought mechanism, leaving advanced CoT methods for future analysis \\cite{bao2024wnc}. The \"Isolation\" SCM type (Type IV) was not a primary focus due to its complexity. Golden CoT was only available for a subset of datasets, and some consistency evaluations relied on manual assessment \\cite{bao2024wnc}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The findings are applicable to understanding the internal reasoning processes of LLMs using CoT, diagnosing issues of faithfulness and consistency, and guiding future research on improving LLM reasoning capabilities.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art**: This paper provides a novel, principled *causal framework* for diagnosing the underlying mechanisms of LLM reasoning, moving beyond behavioral observations to structural insights \\cite{bao2024wnc}. It offers a critical distinction between \"reasoning\" and \"explaining\" in LLMs, which is vital for developing more trustworthy AI.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: The findings challenge current paradigms by suggesting that popular post-training techniques (SFT, RLHF) may inadvertently degrade ideal reasoning structures and that model scaling alone is insufficient \\cite{bao2024wnc}. This urges future research to focus on developing *new techniques* that explicitly foster robust causal reasoning in LLMs, leading to more faithful, consistent, and genuinely intelligent AI systems.",
    "intriguing_abstract": "Do Large Language Models truly \"reason\" with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), or merely \"explain\" pre-determined answers?

We also examine various factors influencing the causal structure, finding that in-context learning with examples strengthens it, while post-training techniques like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on human feedback weaken it.

      "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \"How Likely Do LLMs with CoT Mimic Human Reasoning?\" by Bao et al. for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Chain-of-thought (CoT) is a widely used technique for Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform reasoning tasks, but it often fails to consistently improve performance or faithfully represent the LLM's actual reasoning process. The underlying mechanisms causing these inconsistencies and unfaithfulness are not well understood.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: Understanding *when* and *why* CoT issues occur is crucial for developing more reliable and genuinely reasoning LLMs. Existing research primarily focuses on superficial phenomena or enhancing reasoning, rather than diagnosing the fundamental causal relationships within the LLM's problem-solving process.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches**: Previous work includes various CoT prompting techniques (e.g., self-consistency, Tree-of-thought, Graph-of-thought) aimed at enhancing reasoning, and studies that identify or attempt to measure CoT unfaithfulness (e.g., Turpin et al., 2023; Lanham et al., 2023). Other research explores LLMs' causal reasoning capabilities on natural language variables (e.g., ATOMIC, CLadder).\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Existing CoT methods focus on improving or identifying issues at a behavioral level, not on the *underlying causal mechanism*. Studies on LLM causal reasoning typically examine causality between external, question-specific variables, not the internal components of the CoT process itself (instruction, reasoning steps, answer).\n    *   **Positioning**: This paper distinguishes itself by employing a *causal analysis* framework to diagnose the *internal mechanism* of CoT in LLMs, specifically investigating the causal relationships between the problem instruction, the generated CoT, and the final answer \\cite{bao2024wnc}. This approach aims to reveal latent structural causal models (SCMs) that explain observed behaviors like consistency errors.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper abstracts the LLM's problem-solving process into three random variables: Instruction (Z), CoT (X), and Answer (Y). It then uses *causal analysis* with *interventions* to infer the Structural Causal Model (SCM) for LLM-task pairs \\cite{bao2024wnc}. This involves testing two hypotheses: if CoT causes the Answer (given constant Instruction), and if Instruction causes the Answer (given constant CoT), using Average Treatment Effect (ATE) and McNemar's test.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**: The key innovation is the application of *causal inference* to the *internal components* of LLM reasoning, allowing for the identification of four distinct SCM types (Causal Chain, Common Cause, Full Connection, Isolation) that characterize different reasoning behaviors \\cite{bao2024wnc}. This framework differentiates between genuine \"reasoning\" (where the answer is derived from CoT) and \"explaining\" (where CoT is generated based on a latent belief of the answer), providing a deeper understanding of consistency and faithfulness issues.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**: Introduction of a novel causal analysis framework to diagnose the underlying SCMs of LLMs' reasoning processes by modeling Instruction, CoT, and Answer as causal variables \\cite{bao2024wnc}. This framework utilizes specific interventions (e.g., golden CoT, random CoT, random instruction, random bias) to infer causal links.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: Identification of four SCM types, revealing that LLMs often deviate from the ideal \"Causal Chain\" (human-like reasoning) towards \"Common Cause\" or \"Full Connection\" models, which indicate spurious correlations and \"explaining\" rather than true \"reasoning\" \\cite{bao2024wnc}. The study also provides empirical evidence that in-context learning (ICL) strengthens the ideal causal structure, while post-training techniques like supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) *weaken* it \\cite{bao2024wnc}. Furthermore, it surprisingly finds that increasing model size alone does not necessarily strengthen the ideal causal structure \\cite{bao2024wnc}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Experiments were performed on various LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, GPT-4, Llama2, Mistral) across six mathematical and logical reasoning tasks (Addition, Multiplication, GSM8K, ProofWriter, FOLIO, LogiQA) \\cite{bao2024wnc}. Interventions were applied to CoT (golden/random CoT) and Instruction (random instruction/bias) to test causal hypotheses. The influence of ICL, SFT, RLHF, and model size on the inferred SCMs was also investigated.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**: Accuracy was used to evaluate task performance, and Average Treatment Effect (ATE) with McNemar's test determined the statistical significance of causal relationships \\cite{bao2024wnc}. The study found that a significant portion of LLM-task pairs exhibited SCM types (II and III) indicative of spurious correlations and potential consistency errors. For instance, GPT-3.5-turbo showed ideal Type I SCM for GSM8K and FOLIO but Type II for Addition. Crucially, ICL was shown to strengthen the ideal causal structure, while SFT and RLHF were found to weaken it. Model size alone did not guarantee a stronger ideal causal structure \\cite{bao2024wnc}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The study focuses on the basic chain-of-thought mechanism, leaving advanced CoT methods for future analysis \\cite{bao2024wnc}. The \"Isolation\" SCM type (Type IV) was not a primary focus due to its complexity. Golden CoT was only available for a subset of datasets, and some consistency evaluations relied on manual assessment \\cite{bao2024wnc}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The findings are applicable to understanding the internal reasoning processes of LLMs using CoT, diagnosing issues of faithfulness and consistency, and guiding future research on improving LLM reasoning capabilities.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art**: This paper provides a novel, principled *causal framework* for diagnosing the underlying mechanisms of LLM reasoning, moving beyond behavioral observations to structural insights \\cite{bao2024wnc}. It offers a critical distinction between \"reasoning\" and \"explaining\" in LLMs, which is vital for developing more trustworthy AI.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: The findings challenge current paradigms by suggesting that popular post-training techniques (SFT, RLHF) may inadvertently degrade ideal reasoning structures and that model scaling alone is insufficient \\cite{bao2024wnc}. This urges future research to focus on developing *new techniques* that explicitly foster robust causal reasoning in LLMs, leading to more faithful, consistent, and genuinely intelligent AI systems.",

Despite the impressive progress, the research question regarding the safety vulnerability of LLM-empowered RecSys still remains largely under-investigated. Given the security and privacy concerns, it is more practical to focus on attacking the black-box RecSys, where attackers can only observe the system's inputs and outputs. However, traditional attack approaches employing reinforcement learning (RL) agents are not effective for attacking LLM-empowered RecSys due to the limited capabilities in processing complex textual inputs, planning, and reasoning. On the other hand, LLMs provide unprecedented opportunities to serve as attack agents to attack RecSys because of their impressive capability in simulating human-like decision-making processes. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel attack framework called CheatAgent by harnessing the human-like capabilities of LLMs, where an LLM-based agent is developed to attack LLM-Empowered RecSys. Specifically, our method first identifies the insertion position for maximum impact with minimal input modification. After that, the LLM agent is designed to generate adversarial perturbations to insert at target positions. To further improve the quality of generated perturbations, we utilize the prompt tuning technique to improve attacking strategies via feedback from the victim RecSys iteratively. Extensive experiments across three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attacking method.",

    "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **1. Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the \"alignment tax\" in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for Large Language Models (LLMs). This refers to the degradation of abilities (e.g., basic language skills, performance on public benchmarks) acquired during pre-training and Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) when LLMs are aligned with human preferences via RLHF.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge**: Effectively aligning LLMs with human values is crucial for their utility, but doing so without \"forgetting\" foundational capabilities is a central and challenging trade-off. Current RLHF methods struggle to simultaneously maximize human preference rewards and minimize this alignment tax, often requiring a compromise.\n\n*   **2. Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: The work relates to RLHF, Continual Learning (CL), Robust Fine-tuning, and Offline Model Merging.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   **RLHF (e.g., PPO, DPO)**: While using KL divergence penalties, these methods still exhibit the bonus-tax trade-off, struggling to balance reward optimization and maintaining linguistic taxonomies \\cite{lu202435m}.\n        *   **Continual Learning**: Traditional CL methods for catastrophic forgetting often require data for previous training tasks (experience replay), which is impractical for many LLM alignment scenarios \\cite{lu202435m}.\n        *   **Robust Fine-tuning**: Many robust fine-tuning methods necessitate supplementary forward and backward computations, making them inefficient for large-scale models \\cite{lu202435m}.\n        *   **Offline Model Merging**: While offline merging (e.g., combining SFT and RLHF model parameters once) can mitigate alignment tax by restoring SFT capabilities, it significantly diminishes human preference rewards (alignment bonus) \\cite{lu202435m}. It only allows for a fixed trade-off rather than continuous optimization.\n\n*   **3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes the \"Online Merging Optimizer\" \\cite{lu202435m}.

Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the \"alignment tax\" in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for Large Language Models (LLMs). This refers to the degradation of abilities (e.g., basic language skills, performance on public benchmarks) acquired during pre-training and Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) when LLMs are aligned with human preferences via RLHF.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge**: Effectively aligning LLMs with human values is crucial for their utility, but doing so without \"forgetting\" foundational capabilities is a central and challenging trade-off.

However, ensuring the safety of LLMs during fine-tuning remains a critical concern, and mitigating the potential conflicts in safety and helpfulness is costly in RLHF. To address this issue, we propose a supervised learning framework called Bi-Factorial Preference Optimization (BFPO), which re-parameterizes a joint RLHF objective of both safety and helpfulness into a single supervised learning objective. In supervised optimization, a labeling function is used to capture the global preferences ranking to balance both safety and helpfulness. To evaluate BFPO, we develop a benchmark that includes comprehensive discriminative and generative tasks for helpfulness and harmlessness. The results indicate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both safety and helpfulness. Moreover, BFPO achieves the same level of safety as methods that heavily rely on human labor with less than 10\\% of the computational resources and human prompting and annotation process.

It assigns varying label values (positive for preferred, negative for dispreferred) and magnitudes based on the safety status of both responses in a pair.\n    *   **Theoretical Innovation**: The work establishes a theoretical equivalence between this supervised optimization problem (using the proposed `gI`) and the multi-objective RLHF objective with a specific combined reward function `g(y|x)` \\cite{zhang2024b6u}. This ensures that the optimal model found by BFPO also optimizes both safety and helpfulness rewards in the RL context.\n\n*   **4.

Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Benchmark**: A new benchmark was developed, including comprehensive discriminative and generative tasks for helpfulness and harmlessness \\cite{zhang2024b6u}.\n    *   **Performance Metrics**: The paper evaluates models on both safety and helpfulness scores.\n    *   **Key Results**:\n        *   BFPO significantly outperforms existing approaches in both safety and helpfulness \\cite{zhang2024b6u}.\n        *   It efficiently improves the harmlessness of open-sourced models by 15% using public datasets and by 13% with only 1.5K red teaming data, while preserving helpfulness \\cite{zhang2024b6u}.\n        *   BFPO achieves comparable safety scores to methods that require extensive human labor (red teaming, specific annotations) but with less than 10% of the computational resources and human prompting/annotation process \\cite{zhang2024b6u}.\n        *   Experiments on a synthetic dataset demonstrate BFPO's ability to recover the desired ranking, unlike DPO or IPO \\cite{zhang2024b6u}.\n\n*   **6. Limitations & Scope**\n    *   The paper does not explicitly list technical limitations within the provided text.\n    *   The scope of applicability is LLM alignment for balancing safety and helpfulness.\n    *   The method primarily relies on publicly available datasets, though it can be further enhanced with a small amount of red teaming data (1.5K prompts) \\cite{zhang2024b6u}.\n\n*   **7. Technical Significance**\n    *   BFPO advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing an efficient and effective supervised learning framework for multi-objective LLM alignment, overcoming the limitations of prior RLHF and DPO methods \\cite{zhang2024b6u}.\n    *   It significantly reduces the reliance on costly and labor-intensive human feedback and \"red teaming\" processes for achieving high levels of LLM safety, making alignment more scalable and accessible \\cite{zhang2024b6u}.\n    *   The theoretical equivalence established provides a strong foundation for the supervised approach, linking it directly to established multi-objective RLHF principles.\n    *   This work has the potential to impact future research by enabling more efficient development of safe and helpful LLMs, fostering broader adoption of advanced alignment techniques.",

In this paper, we begin by introducing a lightweight way to quantify uncertainties in rewards, relying solely on the last layer embeddings of the reward model, without the need for computationally expensive reward ensembles. AdvPO then addresses a distributionally robust optimization problem centred around the confidence interval of the reward model's predictions for policy improvement.

    "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review, emphasizing technical innovations and empirical validation:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Problem:** The paper addresses the challenge of improving Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning capabilities through post-training reinforcement learning (RL) without relying on extensive external supervision (human feedback or verifiable rewards). Specifically, it investigates Reinforcement Learning from Internal Feedback (RLIF), which uses intrinsic, model-derived signals.\n    *   **Motivation:** Existing RL methods like RLHF and RLVR require significant external supervision, which is costly and data-intensive. RLIF offers an unsupervised alternative, but its conditions for effectiveness and the optimal internal feedback signals are not well understood. The paper aims to determine when and how RLIF works best \\cite{zhang2025d44}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches:** The paper positions its work against Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) \\cite{zhang2025d44} and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) \\cite{zhang2025d44}, which have shown strong results in aligning LLMs and enhancing reasoning (e.g., DeepSeek-R1 with GRPO \\cite{zhang2025d44}).\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:** RLVR, despite its advancements, primarily shifts the model's output distribution and narrows its reasoning scope, struggling to surpass inherent capability limits for metrics like pass@N \\cite{zhang2025d44}. Previous RLIF works (e.g., Zhang et al., 2025; Zhao et al., 2025) introduced the concept but lacked a systematic exploration of different internal signals and a comprehensive understanding of their underlying mechanisms and limitations \\cite{zhang2025d44}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper systematically explores three unsupervised reward proxies for RLIF: self-certainty, trajectory-level entropy, and token-level entropy \\cite{zhang2025d44}.

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) to improve reasoning. Approaches like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have shown strong results, but they require extensive external supervision. We investigate an alternative class of methods, Reinforcement Learning from Internal Feedback (RLIF), which relies solely on intrinsic model-derived signals instead of external rewards. In particular, we leverage unsupervised reward proxies such as token-level entropy, trajectory-level entropy, and self-certainty. Our theoretical analysis shows these internal objectives are partially equivalent, and we empirically evaluate various RLIF strategies on challenging math reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that RLIF can boost the reasoning performance of base LLMs at the beginning phase of the training, matching or surpassing RLVR techniques on these tasks. However, when training progresses, performance degrades even below the model before training. Moreover, we find that RLIF yields little improvement for instruction-tuned models, indicating diminishing returns of intrinsic feedback once an LLM is already instruction-tuned. We further analyze this limitation by mixing model weights and explain the reason of RLIF's training behaviors, providing practical guidelines for integrating internal feedback signals into LLM training. We hope our analysis of internal feedback will inform more principled and effective strategies for LLM post-training.",

    "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n---\n\n**1. Research Problem & Motivation**\n\n*   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the challenge of aligning AI models with human values using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) when preferences are sourced from diverse populations. Specifically, it tackles the issue of \"hidden context\"—unobservable factors influencing preferences—which leads to contradictory preferences and makes single-point reward estimates suboptimal or unfair to specific groups \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n*   **Importance & Challenge**:\n    *   Ensuring AI safety and functionality critically depends on aligning with diverse human values.\n    *   Hidden context causes preferences to be contradictory, preventing a single reward function or policy from satisfying all users.\n    *   Existing methods often marginalize over hidden context (e.g., Marginalized Distributional Preference Learning - MDPL), failing to account for \"persistent annotator identity\" in sequential tasks, which can lead to fairness issues and suboptimal performance in general RL settings \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   The goal is to learn a *set* of policies, each optimal for a distinct hidden context group, *without* requiring explicit group labels.\n\n**2. Related Work & Positioning**\n\n*   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n    *   **Point Estimates**: Many RLHF approaches derive a single reward function, which is often suboptimal for any individual group and can underrepresent minority preferences \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   **Explicit Grouping**: Some methods model different user expertise but necessitate *concrete ways to distinguish between groups* (e.g., explicit labels), a requirement POPL circumvents \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   **Contextual Bandits**: Prior work addressing hidden context (e.g., Chakraborty et al., 2024; Siththaranjan et al., 2023) often operates within *contextual bandit settings*, which are insufficient for general sequential RL tasks \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   **Marginalized Distributional Preference Learning (MDPL)**: While attempting to account for hidden context, MDPL systems marginalize over it per state. This prevents them from maintaining coherent, full reward functions or policies for each group across sequential tasks, thus failing to capture persistent annotator identity and potentially leading to fairness issues (as illustrated in Figure 2 of the paper) \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   **Bayesian Reward Inference**: Methods like B-REx (Brown et al., 2020b) frequently rely on the assumption of Boltzmann-rational human preferences, which is often inaccurate \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   **Other Pareto-Optimal Approaches**: Ramé et al. (2024) also generate Pareto-optimal reward functions but *assume access to ground truth reward functions for each group* and use weight interpolation, a key distinction from POPL's label-free approach \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n\n**3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n\n*   **Core Technical Method**: Pareto Optimal Preference Learning (POPL) addresses pluralistic alignment by framing discrepant group preferences as multiple objectives with potential trade-offs. It aims to learn a *set* of reward functions or policies that are Pareto-optimal with respect to the given preference dataset \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n*   **Algorithm**: POPL utilizes **lexicase selection**, an iterative evolutionary algorithm known for selecting diverse and Pareto-optimal solutions. In POPL, each human preference (from an annotator with hidden context) is treated as a distinct \"metric\" or objective \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n*   **Novelty/Difference**:\n    *   **Multi-objective Re-framing**: It innovatively re-frames preference learning with hidden context as a multi-objective optimization problem, where each individual preference constitutes a single objective \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   **Lexicase Selection for Preferences**: POPL applies lexicase selection by using a random ordering of preferences for each selection event. Candidate hypotheses (reward functions or policies) are filtered based on their ability to \"pass\" each preference (i.e., correctly rank the preferred segment). This process, with repeated random shuffles, generates a diverse population of Pareto-optimal solutions \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   **Contradictory Preference Handling**: Lexicase selection naturally handles contradictory preferences by prioritizing the first preference encountered in a given random shuffle, leading to the selection of diverse reward function profiles \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   **Label-Free Alignment**: A significant innovation is that POPL achieves pluralistic alignment *without requiring access to group numbers or explicit membership labels* \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   **Sequential Task Generalization**: It extends preference learning with hidden context from limited contextual bandit settings to more general sequential, time-based domains, overcoming the limitations of MDPLs regarding persistent annotator identity \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n\n**4. Key Technical Contributions**\n\n*   **Theoretical Insight**: The paper provides theoretical results, specifically Theorem 1, proving that optimal policies for specific hidden context groups are inherently Pareto-Optimal with respect to the set of all preferences. This establishes a rigorous mathematical foundation for the POPL approach \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n*   **Novel Framework**: Introduces \"Pareto-Optimal Preference Learning\" (POPL), a novel framework that leverages lexicase selection to generate a set of Pareto-Optimal reward functions or policies. This framework ensures diverse, group-specific alignment with human preferences, facilitating robust personalization and fairness \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n*   **Extension of RLHF-HC**: POPL significantly extends the problem of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback with Hidden Context (RLHF-HC) from contextual bandits to critical sequential, time-based domains, addressing a major limitation in the field \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n*   **Flexible System Design**: POPL's design allows it to learn either a set of reward functions (which then train policies) or policies directly from preferences, offering flexibility across different RLHF paradigms (e.g., compatible with Contrastive Preference Learning - CPL for direct policy learning) \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n\n**5. Experimental Validation**\n\n*   **Experiments Conducted**: POPL's effectiveness was empirically validated across a diverse set of environments:\n    *   A stateless preference learning setting.\n    *   A Minigrid RL domain, demonstrating policy learning in grid-based decision-making.\n    *   Metaworld robotics benchmarks, focusing on balancing safety and speed in 3D manipulation tasks.\n    *   Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning, specifically for Jailbreaking Detection, where it mitigated harmful outputs by aligning preferences for helpfulness and harmlessness *without explicit labels* \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n*   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results**:\n    *   POPL consistently \"surpasses baseline methods in learning sets of reward functions and policies\" \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   It effectively caters to distinct groups *without requiring access to group numbers or membership labels* \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   The experiments demonstrated POPL's \"superiority over strong baselines\" across the tested domains \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   POPL showcased its ability to \"efficiently scale to high-dimensional tasks, such as those involving LLMs, while maintaining computational efficiency\" \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   It achieved \"robust results with pre-trained models,\" highlighting its practical applicability \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n\n**6. Limitations & Scope**\n\n*   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**:\n    *   The foundational theoretical result (Theorem 1) is derived \"in a completely noiseless setting,\" which represents an idealization and may not perfectly hold in real-world scenarios with noisy preference data \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   Lexicase selection identifies candidates that are Pareto-optimal *relative to a starting set of candidates*, meaning it finds a diverse set on the Pareto front of the current population, rather than necessarily the absolute global Pareto front of all possible candidates \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n*   **Scope of Applicability**:\n    *   POPL is broadly applicable across various domains requiring fairness, alignment, and diversity in AI models \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   It can serve as a foundational technique for developing and optimizing specific notions of group fairness in AI systems \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   The method is effective in sequential, time-based domains, overcoming the limitations of many prior approaches restricted to contextual bandits \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   It operates effectively without explicit group labels or relying on potentially faulty assumptions of Boltzmann-rationality \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n\n**7. Technical Significance**\n\n*   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: POPL significantly advances the field of RLHF by offering a robust framework for pluralistic alignment that explicitly addresses hidden context and contradictory preferences without the need for explicit group labels. It moves beyond single-point reward estimates to learn a *set* of diverse, group-specific optimal solutions, representing a crucial step towards more inclusive AI \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n*   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n    *   **Fairness and Equity**: Provides a strong foundation for developing AI systems that are inherently more fair and equitable by ensuring that no specific group's preferences are disregarded, even when group identities are unknown \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   **Personalization**: Enables robust personalization by generating a set of policies from which an optimal one can be selected for a given user in a few-shot manner at test time, enhancing user experience \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   **General RLHF**: Extends the applicability of RLHF-HC to more complex, sequential decision-making tasks beyond contextual bandits, opening new avenues for research in robotics, control, and other dynamic environments \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   **LLM Alignment**: Offers a scalable and efficient method for fine-tuning large language models to align with diverse and potentially conflicting human preferences (e.g., balancing helpfulness and harmlessness) without relying on explicit labels for these dimensions \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.",

      "abstract": "Ensuring AI models align with human values is essential for their safety and functionality. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) leverages human preferences to achieve this alignment. However, when preferences are sourced from diverse populations, point estimates of reward can result in suboptimal performance or be unfair to specific groups. We propose Pareto Optimal Preference Learning (POPL), which enables pluralistic alignment by framing discrepant group preferences as objectives with potential trade-offs, aiming for policies that are Pareto-optimal on the preference dataset. POPL utilizes lexicase selection, an iterative process that selects diverse and Pareto-optimal solutions. Our theoretical and empirical evaluations demonstrate that POPL surpasses baseline methods in learning sets of reward functions and policies, effectively catering to distinct groups without access to group numbers or membership labels. We verify the performance of POPL on a stateless preference learning setting, a Minigrid RL domain, Metaworld robotics benchmarks, as well as large language model (LLM) fine-tuning. We illustrate that POPL can also serve as a foundation for techniques optimizing specific notions of group fairness, ensuring safe and equitable AI model alignment.",

      "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n---\n\n**1. Research Problem & Motivation**\n\n*   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the challenge of aligning AI models with human values using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) when preferences are sourced from diverse populations. Specifically, it tackles the issue of \"hidden context\"—unobservable factors influencing preferences—which leads to contradictory preferences and makes single-point reward estimates suboptimal or unfair to specific groups \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n*   **Importance & Challenge**:\n    *   Ensuring AI safety and functionality critically depends on aligning with diverse human values.\n    *   Hidden context causes preferences to be contradictory, preventing a single reward function or policy from satisfying all users.\n    *   Existing methods often marginalize over hidden context (e.g., Marginalized Distributional Preference Learning - MDPL), failing to account for \"persistent annotator identity\" in sequential tasks, which can lead to fairness issues and suboptimal performance in general RL settings \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   The goal is to learn a *set* of policies, each optimal for a distinct hidden context group, *without* requiring explicit group labels.\n\n**2. Related Work & Positioning**\n\n*   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n    *   **Point Estimates**: Many RLHF approaches derive a single reward function, which is often suboptimal for any individual group and can underrepresent minority preferences \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   **Explicit Grouping**: Some methods model different user expertise but necessitate *concrete ways to distinguish between groups* (e.g., explicit labels), a requirement POPL circumvents \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   **Contextual Bandits**: Prior work addressing hidden context (e.g., Chakraborty et al., 2024; Siththaranjan et al., 2023) often operates within *contextual bandit settings*, which are insufficient for general sequential RL tasks \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   **Marginalized Distributional Preference Learning (MDPL)**: While attempting to account for hidden context, MDPL systems marginalize over it per state. This prevents them from maintaining coherent, full reward functions or policies for each group across sequential tasks, thus failing to capture persistent annotator identity and potentially leading to fairness issues (as illustrated in Figure 2 of the paper) \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   **Bayesian Reward Inference**: Methods like B-REx (Brown et al., 2020b) frequently rely on the assumption of Boltzmann-rational human preferences, which is often inaccurate \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   **Other Pareto-Optimal Approaches**: Ramé et al. (2024) also generate Pareto-optimal reward functions but *assume access to ground truth reward functions for each group* and use weight interpolation, a key distinction from POPL's label-free approach \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n\n**3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n\n*   **Core Technical Method**: Pareto Optimal Preference Learning (POPL) addresses pluralistic alignment by framing discrepant group preferences as multiple objectives with potential trade-offs. It aims to learn a *set* of reward functions or policies that are Pareto-optimal with respect to the given preference dataset \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n*   **Algorithm**: POPL utilizes **lexicase selection**, an iterative evolutionary algorithm known for selecting diverse and Pareto-optimal solutions. In POPL, each human preference (from an annotator with hidden context) is treated as a distinct \"metric\" or objective \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n*   **Novelty/Difference**:\n    *   **Multi-objective Re-framing**: It innovatively re-frames preference learning with hidden context as a multi-objective optimization problem, where each individual preference constitutes a single objective \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   **Lexicase Selection for Preferences**: POPL applies lexicase selection by using a random ordering of preferences for each selection event. Candidate hypotheses (reward functions or policies) are filtered based on their ability to \"pass\" each preference (i.e., correctly rank the preferred segment). This process, with repeated random shuffles, generates a diverse population of Pareto-optimal solutions \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   **Contradictory Preference Handling**: Lexicase selection naturally handles contradictory preferences by prioritizing the first preference encountered in a given random shuffle, leading to the selection of diverse reward function profiles \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   **Label-Free Alignment**: A significant innovation is that POPL achieves pluralistic alignment *without requiring access to group numbers or explicit membership labels* \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   **Sequential Task Generalization**: It extends preference learning with hidden context from limited contextual bandit settings to more general sequential, time-based domains, overcoming the limitations of MDPLs regarding persistent annotator identity \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n\n**4. Key Technical Contributions**\n\n*   **Theoretical Insight**: The paper provides theoretical results, specifically Theorem 1, proving that optimal policies for specific hidden context groups are inherently Pareto-Optimal with respect to the set of all preferences. This establishes a rigorous mathematical foundation for the POPL approach \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n*   **Novel Framework**: Introduces \"Pareto-Optimal Preference Learning\" (POPL), a novel framework that leverages lexicase selection to generate a set of Pareto-Optimal reward functions or policies. This framework ensures diverse, group-specific alignment with human preferences, facilitating robust personalization and fairness \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n*   **Extension of RLHF-HC**: POPL significantly extends the problem of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback with Hidden Context (RLHF-HC) from contextual bandits to critical sequential, time-based domains, addressing a major limitation in the field \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n*   **Flexible System Design**: POPL's design allows it to learn either a set of reward functions (which then train policies) or policies directly from preferences, offering flexibility across different RLHF paradigms (e.g., compatible with Contrastive Preference Learning - CPL for direct policy learning) \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n\n**5. Experimental Validation**\n\n*   **Experiments Conducted**: POPL's effectiveness was empirically validated across a diverse set of environments:\n    *   A stateless preference learning setting.\n    *   A Minigrid RL domain, demonstrating policy learning in grid-based decision-making.\n    *   Metaworld robotics benchmarks, focusing on balancing safety and speed in 3D manipulation tasks.\n    *   Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning, specifically for Jailbreaking Detection, where it mitigated harmful outputs by aligning preferences for helpfulness and harmlessness *without explicit labels* \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n*   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results**:\n    *   POPL consistently \"surpasses baseline methods in learning sets of reward functions and policies\" \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   It effectively caters to distinct groups *without requiring access to group numbers or membership labels* \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   The experiments demonstrated POPL's \"superiority over strong baselines\" across the tested domains \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   POPL showcased its ability to \"efficiently scale to high-dimensional tasks, such as those involving LLMs, while maintaining computational efficiency\" \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   It achieved \"robust results with pre-trained models,\" highlighting its practical applicability \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n\n**6. Limitations & Scope**\n\n*   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**:\n    *   The foundational theoretical result (Theorem 1) is derived \"in a completely noiseless setting,\" which represents an idealization and may not perfectly hold in real-world scenarios with noisy preference data \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   Lexicase selection identifies candidates that are Pareto-optimal *relative to a starting set of candidates*, meaning it finds a diverse set on the Pareto front of the current population, rather than necessarily the absolute global Pareto front of all possible candidates \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n*   **Scope of Applicability**:\n    *   POPL is broadly applicable across various domains requiring fairness, alignment, and diversity in AI models \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   It can serve as a foundational technique for developing and optimizing specific notions of group fairness in AI systems \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   The method is effective in sequential, time-based domains, overcoming the limitations of many prior approaches restricted to contextual bandits \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   It operates effectively without explicit group labels or relying on potentially faulty assumptions of Boltzmann-rationality \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n\n**7. Technical Significance**\n\n*   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: POPL significantly advances the field of RLHF by offering a robust framework for pluralistic alignment that explicitly addresses hidden context and contradictory preferences without the need for explicit group labels. It moves beyond single-point reward estimates to learn a *set* of diverse, group-specific optimal solutions, representing a crucial step towards more inclusive AI \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n*   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n    *   **Fairness and Equity**: Provides a strong foundation for developing AI systems that are inherently more fair and equitable by ensuring that no specific group's preferences are disregarded, even when group identities are unknown \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   **Personalization**: Enables robust personalization by generating a set of policies from which an optimal one can be selected for a given user in a few-shot manner at test time, enhancing user experience \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   **General RLHF**: Extends the applicability of RLHF-HC to more complex, sequential decision-making tasks beyond contextual bandits, opening new avenues for research in robotics, control, and other dynamic environments \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.\n    *   **LLM Alignment**: Offers a scalable and efficient method for fine-tuning large language models to align with diverse and potentially conflicting human preferences (e.g., balancing helpfulness and harmlessness) without relying on explicit labels for these dimensions \\cite{boldi2024d0s}.",

Experimental Validation\n*   **Experiments Conducted**:\n    *   **Helpful and Harmless Assistant Task (HHA)**: Evaluates LLM alignment for helpfulness and harmlessness.\n    *   **Generative Benchmarks**: MMLU, HumanEval, BigBench-Hard, and GSM8k, to assess general generation capabilities.\n*   **Key Performance Metrics**:\n    *   **Reward Score**: Calculated using the OffsetBiasRM reward model on the HHA test set, indicating helpfulness and harmlessness.\n    *   Standard metrics for generative benchmarks (not explicitly detailed in the provided text, but implied).\n*   **Comparison Results**:\n    *   `\\cite{du2025zfp}` compares `VAR` against DPO, and also `SFT+VAR` against `SFT+DPO`, starting from both base and SFT models.\n    *   **HHA Benchmark**: `VAR` consistently achieves competitive performance, often outperforming DPO in reward scores across various Llama and Qwen2.5 model sizes (e.g., for Llama3.2-1B, `VAR` achieves an Avg. All reward of 57.44 compared to DPO's 45.66; `SFT+VAR` achieves 65.84 compared to `SFT+DPO`'s 62.98).\n    *   `\\cite{du2025zfp}` demonstrates that `VAR` provides noticeable improvement on training stability and effectiveness.\n    *   The use of the OffsetBias dataset for training, which mitigates common biases, contributes to more robust and reliable reward scores for `VAR`'s training.\n\n### 6. Limitations & Scope\n*   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: `\\cite{du2025zfp}` primarily frames its contribution as *overcoming* the limitations of existing methods (e.g., clipping, negative weights leading to instability and unbounded loss landscapes in DPO and A-LoL). The paper does not explicitly state technical limitations of `VAR` itself, but rather positions it as a robust solution.\n*   **Scope of Applicability**: The method is applicable to aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, specifically focusing on helpfulness and harmlessness, and improving general generative capabilities. It is designed to simplify and stabilize the RLHF process.\n\n### 7. Technical Significance\n*   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: `\\cite{du2025zfp}` significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by offering a principled, stable, and effective simplification of RLHF. By reformulating the problem as variational inference over positive measures, it addresses fundamental instability issues inherent in previous methods that rely on clipping or negative weights.\n*   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: `VAR`'s reward-driven weighted SFT approach, combined with efficient in-batch normalization, makes LLM alignment more accessible, computationally less demanding, and robust. This could lead to broader adoption of alignment techniques, more stable and reliable LLM training, and potentially enable the development of more sophisticated alignment objectives that leverage the stability provided by `VAR`'s framework.",

    "intriguing_abstract": "Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with nuanced human preferences remains a formidable challenge for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), often hampered by sparse and inconsistent supervision signals. We introduce **ALARM (Align Language Models via Hierarchical Rewards Modeling)**, the first framework to fundamentally rethink reward structures in RLHF by integrating holistic and proactively selected aspect-specific rewards. Unlike conventional methods that rely on single, holistic feedback or fixed reward combinations, ALARM dynamically combines rewards: aspect-specific guidance is only activated when a generation surpasses a holistic quality threshold, providing precise, consistent signals for reaching superior human preference areas. Our novel reward selection mechanism proactively identifies and incorporates only those aspect-specific rewards consistent with overall human judgment, mitigating conflicting signals. Validated across complex text generation tasks like long-form question answering and machine translation, ALARM significantly outperforms existing baselines, demonstrating superior alignment and robustness. This hierarchical approach offers a critical advancement towards scalable oversight and the development of truly human-aligned LLMs, paving the way for more sophisticated reward modeling paradigms.",

    "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review, adhering to the specified requirements:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to generate user-focused responses for Code Community Question Answering (CCQA) tasks due to the unique characteristics of these communities. Specifically, CCQA involves multiple possible answers with diverse user preferences, and a strong community preference for up-to-date APIs, which often leads to LLMs producing outdated or non-preferred answers \\cite{yang2024ppw}.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge:** CCQA is crucial for boosting productivity in software engineering and academic research. The challenge lies in aligning LLMs with complex, multi-faceted user preferences (beyond a single \"accepted\" answer) and ensuring the generated code snippets and solutions are current and relevant, given the rapid evolution of programming APIs \\cite{yang2024ppw}. Existing Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methods are often limited to pairwise comparisons, which are insufficient for the multi-answer nature of CCQA, and previous ranking methods overlook diverse user preferences and LLM feedback \\cite{yang2024ppw}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** This work builds upon advancements in LLMs for open-domain QA and code generation, and the concept of preference alignment via RLHF \\cite{yang2024ppw}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n        *   **Traditional RLHF:** Typically employs pairwise comparisons (e.g., Bradley-Terry model) and a three-stage process (SFT, reward model training, PPO), which is not well-suited for questions with multiple answers and diverse preferences \\cite{yang2024ppw}. It also suffers from sensitivity to RL parameters.\n        *   **Prior CCQA Answer Ranking:** Methods like L2R \\cite{10} and RCNN \\cite{61} utilize features like user characteristics, stylistic elements, or thread-level features. Other approaches consider recency and quality \\cite{2}.

      "abstract": "Code Community Question Answering (CCQA) seeks to tackle programming-related issues, thereby boosting productivity in both software engineering and academic research. Recent advancements in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) have transformed the fine-tuning process of Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce responses that closely mimic human behavior. Leveraging LLMs with RLHF for practical CCQA applications has thus emerged as a promising area of study. Unlike standard code question-answering tasks, CCQA involves multiple possible answers, with varying user preferences for each response. Additionally, code communities often show a preference for new APIs. These challenges prevent LLMs from generating responses that cater to the diverse preferences of users in CCQA tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called Aligning LLMs through Multi-perspective User Preference Ranking-based Feedback for Programming Question Answering (ALMupQA) to create user-focused responses. Our approach starts with Multi-perspective Preference Ranking Alignment (MPRA), which synthesizes varied user preferences based on the characteristics of answers from code communities. We then introduce a Retrieval-augmented In-context Learning (RIL) module to mitigate the problem of outdated answers by retrieving responses to similar questions from a question bank. Due to the limited availability of high-quality, multi-answer CCQA datasets, we also developed a dataset named StaCCQA from real code communities. Extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the ALMupQA framework in terms of accuracy and user preference. Compared to the base model, ALMupQA showed nearly an 11% improvement in BLEU, with increases of 20% and 17.5% in BERTScore and CodeBERTScore, respectively.",

    "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review, highlighting its technical innovations and empirical validation:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** Standard Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) operates at the individual token level, leading to a severe \"credit assignment problem\" over long sequences. This makes it difficult for the model to determine which specific tokens contributed to a preferred outcome, especially with delayed rewards \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** This problem significantly hinders learning efficiency, slows convergence of LLMs to human preferences, and causes the model to overlook essential local co-occurrence patterns or inherent structures between adjacent tokens (e.g., multi-word expressions) \\cite{chai2024qal}. Subword tokenization further exacerbates this by increasing sequence lengths \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** MA-RLHF builds upon and generalizes existing token-level RLHF methods (e.g., PPO-based RLHF) by introducing a variable granularity of action decisions \\cite{chai2024qal}. It leverages the concept of \"macro actions\" or \"options\" from classical reinforcement learning and planning literature (e.g., SMDPs) \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:** Prior RLHF methods are primarily token-level, requiring numerous minute adjustments and struggling with long-distance dependencies due to the credit assignment problem \\cite{chai2024qal}. This fine-grained approach can miss higher-level linguistic constructs and patterns \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper proposes MA-RLHF, an RLHF framework that integrates \"macro actions\" – sequences of tokens or higher-level language constructs – into the learning process \\cite{chai2024qal}. While the underlying policy still generates individual tokens, the *optimization* occurs at the macro-action level, treating these sequences as single decision units \\cite{chai2024qal}. This is achieved by adapting the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to operate on macro actions (MA-PPO) \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:**\n        *   **Temporal Abstraction:** By operating at a higher level of abstraction, MA-RLHF reduces the temporal distance between actions and rewards, facilitating faster and more accurate credit assignment \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n        *   **Macro Action Definition:** Macro actions are primarily defined by their \"termination condition,\" with three variants explored: fixed/randomized n-grams, parsing-based (aligning with grammatical structures), and perplexity-based (terminating when a token negatively impacts macro action perplexity) \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n        *   **De-tokenization Perspective:** The approach can be viewed as a \"de-tokenization\" process, reconstructing high-level language units from subword pieces, thereby reducing decision points and shortening trajectories \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n        *   **Flexible Granularity:** MA-RLHF offers a flexible framework that can range from standard token-level RLHF (when macro action length is 1) to methods approximating contextual bandits (when macro action length approaches infinity) \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Framework:** Introduction of MA-RLHF, a simple yet effective framework that integrates macro actions into RLHF for LLM alignment \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n    *   **Adapted Optimization:** Adaptation of the PPO algorithm (MA-PPO) to compute policy gradients based on the advantage of macro-action sequences, using a joint probability for macro actions and an option-level value function \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n    *   **Exploration of Termination Conditions:** Investigation and empirical validation of different macro action termination conditions (n-gram, parsing-based, perplexity-based) \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n    *   **Efficiency without Overhead:** Demonstrates enhanced learning efficiency and faster convergence without introducing additional computational costs during training or inference \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** Extensive experiments were performed across various LLM sizes (Gemma-2B, 7B, 27B; CodeGemma-2B, 7B) and diverse tasks: text summarization (TL;DR), dialogue generation (HH-RLHF), question answering (WebGPT Comparison), and program synthesis (APPS) \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results:**\n        *   **Performance Gains:** MA-RLHF achieved substantial performance improvements over standard RLHF, with gains of up to 30% in text summarization and code generation, 18% in dialogue, and 8% in question answering tasks, measured by Reward Model (RM) scores, GPT-4 pairwise evaluation, and human pairwise evaluation \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n        *   **Learning Efficiency:** The method reached parity with vanilla RLHF 1.7 to 2 times faster in terms of training time and consistently continued to outperform it with further training \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n        *   **Scalability & Robustness:** MA-RLHF demonstrated strong scalability across model sizes (2B to 27B parameters) and robust generalization capabilities under varying experimental settings (e.g., temperature values, rejection sampling) \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n        *   **Code Generation:** For program synthesis, MA-RLHF showed significant improvements in pass@1 and pass@5 metrics \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The paper implicitly assumes that macro actions can be effectively defined and that the underlying token-level policy can still generate coherent sequences when optimized at a coarser granularity \\cite{chai2024qal}. While different termination conditions are explored, the optimal strategy for defining macro actions might be task-dependent \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The method is primarily applicable to sequence generation tasks where LLMs are aligned with human preferences using RLHF, particularly beneficial for tasks involving long sequences and complex dependencies \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** MA-RLHF significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in RLHF by effectively addressing the long-standing credit assignment problem in LLM training \\cite{chai2024qal}. It demonstrates that incorporating temporal abstraction through macro actions can lead to more efficient and effective alignment of LLMs \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n    *   **Potential Impact:** This work opens new avenues for research into more sophisticated ways of defining and learning macro actions in language models, potentially leading to more robust, efficient, and scalable RLHF training paradigms. It suggests that moving beyond token-level decision-making is crucial for optimizing LLMs for complex, human-aligned tasks \\cite{chai2024qal}.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has demonstrated effectiveness in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, token-level RLHF suffers from the credit assignment problem over long sequences, where delayed rewards make it challenging for the model to discern which actions contributed to preferred outcomes. This hinders learning efficiency and slows convergence.In this paper, we propose MA-RLHF, a simple yet effective RLHF framework that incorporates macro actions -- sequences of tokens or higher-level language constructs -- into the learning process. By operating at higher level of abstraction, our approach reduces the temporal distance between actions and rewards, facilitating faster and more accurate credit assignment. This results in more stable policy gradient estimates and enhances learning efficiency within each episode, all without increasing computational complexity during training or inference. We validate our approach through extensive experiments across various model sizes and tasks, including text summarization, dialogue generation, question answering, and program synthesis. Our method achieves substantial performance improvements over standard RLHF, with performance gains of up to 30% in text summarization and code generation, 18% in dialogue, and 8% in question answering tasks. Notably, our approach reaches parity with vanilla RLHF 1.7 ~ 2 times faster in terms of training time and continues to outperform it with further training.

      "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review, highlighting its technical innovations and empirical validation:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** Standard Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) operates at the individual token level, leading to a severe \"credit assignment problem\" over long sequences. This makes it difficult for the model to determine which specific tokens contributed to a preferred outcome, especially with delayed rewards \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** This problem significantly hinders learning efficiency, slows convergence of LLMs to human preferences, and causes the model to overlook essential local co-occurrence patterns or inherent structures between adjacent tokens (e.g., multi-word expressions) \\cite{chai2024qal}. Subword tokenization further exacerbates this by increasing sequence lengths \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** MA-RLHF builds upon and generalizes existing token-level RLHF methods (e.g., PPO-based RLHF) by introducing a variable granularity of action decisions \\cite{chai2024qal}. It leverages the concept of \"macro actions\" or \"options\" from classical reinforcement learning and planning literature (e.g., SMDPs) \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:** Prior RLHF methods are primarily token-level, requiring numerous minute adjustments and struggling with long-distance dependencies due to the credit assignment problem \\cite{chai2024qal}. This fine-grained approach can miss higher-level linguistic constructs and patterns \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper proposes MA-RLHF, an RLHF framework that integrates \"macro actions\" – sequences of tokens or higher-level language constructs – into the learning process \\cite{chai2024qal}. While the underlying policy still generates individual tokens, the *optimization* occurs at the macro-action level, treating these sequences as single decision units \\cite{chai2024qal}. This is achieved by adapting the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to operate on macro actions (MA-PPO) \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:**\n        *   **Temporal Abstraction:** By operating at a higher level of abstraction, MA-RLHF reduces the temporal distance between actions and rewards, facilitating faster and more accurate credit assignment \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n        *   **Macro Action Definition:** Macro actions are primarily defined by their \"termination condition,\" with three variants explored: fixed/randomized n-grams, parsing-based (aligning with grammatical structures), and perplexity-based (terminating when a token negatively impacts macro action perplexity) \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n        *   **De-tokenization Perspective:** The approach can be viewed as a \"de-tokenization\" process, reconstructing high-level language units from subword pieces, thereby reducing decision points and shortening trajectories \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n        *   **Flexible Granularity:** MA-RLHF offers a flexible framework that can range from standard token-level RLHF (when macro action length is 1) to methods approximating contextual bandits (when macro action length approaches infinity) \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Framework:** Introduction of MA-RLHF, a simple yet effective framework that integrates macro actions into RLHF for LLM alignment \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n    *   **Adapted Optimization:** Adaptation of the PPO algorithm (MA-PPO) to compute policy gradients based on the advantage of macro-action sequences, using a joint probability for macro actions and an option-level value function \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n    *   **Exploration of Termination Conditions:** Investigation and empirical validation of different macro action termination conditions (n-gram, parsing-based, perplexity-based) \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n    *   **Efficiency without Overhead:** Demonstrates enhanced learning efficiency and faster convergence without introducing additional computational costs during training or inference \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** Extensive experiments were performed across various LLM sizes (Gemma-2B, 7B, 27B; CodeGemma-2B, 7B) and diverse tasks: text summarization (TL;DR), dialogue generation (HH-RLHF), question answering (WebGPT Comparison), and program synthesis (APPS) \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results:**\n        *   **Performance Gains:** MA-RLHF achieved substantial performance improvements over standard RLHF, with gains of up to 30% in text summarization and code generation, 18% in dialogue, and 8% in question answering tasks, measured by Reward Model (RM) scores, GPT-4 pairwise evaluation, and human pairwise evaluation \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n        *   **Learning Efficiency:** The method reached parity with vanilla RLHF 1.7 to 2 times faster in terms of training time and consistently continued to outperform it with further training \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n        *   **Scalability & Robustness:** MA-RLHF demonstrated strong scalability across model sizes (2B to 27B parameters) and robust generalization capabilities under varying experimental settings (e.g., temperature values, rejection sampling) \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n        *   **Code Generation:** For program synthesis, MA-RLHF showed significant improvements in pass@1 and pass@5 metrics \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The paper implicitly assumes that macro actions can be effectively defined and that the underlying token-level policy can still generate coherent sequences when optimized at a coarser granularity \\cite{chai2024qal}. While different termination conditions are explored, the optimal strategy for defining macro actions might be task-dependent \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The method is primarily applicable to sequence generation tasks where LLMs are aligned with human preferences using RLHF, particularly beneficial for tasks involving long sequences and complex dependencies \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** MA-RLHF significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in RLHF by effectively addressing the long-standing credit assignment problem in LLM training \\cite{chai2024qal}. It demonstrates that incorporating temporal abstraction through macro actions can lead to more efficient and effective alignment of LLMs \\cite{chai2024qal}.\n    *   **Potential Impact:** This work opens new avenues for research into more sophisticated ways of defining and learning macro actions in language models, potentially leading to more robust, efficient, and scalable RLHF training paradigms. It suggests that moving beyond token-level decision-making is crucial for optimizing LLMs for complex, human-aligned tasks \\cite{chai2024qal}.",

It leverages the rich representations already encapsulated in embeddings, which are often by-products of language generation, thereby eliminating the need for additional LLM forward passes during inference and significantly reducing the parameter count and computational overhead \\cite{sun20250ae}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Methodology:** Proposing and empirically validating embedding-based reward models as a viable, efficient, and reproducible alternative to LLM-based reward models \\cite{sun20250ae}.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations:** Demonstrating that simple models like LightGBM or small MLPs, when fed with embeddings, can effectively serve as reward models, drastically reducing model size and hardware requirements (enabling CPU-only research) \\cite{sun20250ae}.\n    *   **Reproducibility Framework:** Establishing a framework that enhances reproducibility by reducing hardware demands, computational costs, and training instability, and by minimizing the number of vulnerable hyperparameters \\cite{sun20250ae}.\n    *   **Scalable Evaluation:** Introducing a method for creating standardized, reusable datasets of pre-generated embeddings and golden rewards, which allows for rapid and cost-efficient evaluation of new reward modeling techniques \\cite{sun20250ae}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:**\n        *   Comparison of training and evaluation times for embedding-based (LightGBM, 3-layer MLP) vs. LLM-based (GPT2, Gemma2B LoRA) reward models on CPUs and GPUs \\cite{sun20250ae}.\n        *   Empirical comparison of performance, stability, and variance between embedding-based and LLM-based reward models across varying annotation qualities (5% to 45% error rates) and quantities (500 to 10,000 preference pairs) \\cite{sun20250ae}.\n        *   Case study demonstrating the reproduction of existing reward model ensemble research using the embedding-based approach \\cite{sun20250ae}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Results:**\n        *   **Computational Cost (Table 1):** Embedding-based LightGBM trained in 8s on CPU, 3-layer MLP in 28s on CPU (33s on V100 GPU). In contrast, LLM-based GPT2 took >2h on CPU (879s on V100 GPU), and Gemma2B (LoRA) took 4755s on V100 GPU \\cite{sun20250ae}. Evaluation costs showed similar drastic reductions.\n        *   **Performance & Stability (Figure 2, Table 2):**\n            *   Embedding-based methods exhibited significantly lower variance and higher stability during training.\n            *   They consistently outperformed smaller LLM-based models (e.g., LLM-RM-GPT2) across all scenarios.\n            *   Under conditions of low annotation quality or limited annotation quantities, embedding-based methods performed superior to or comparable with larger LLM-based reward models.\n            *   On the \"Harmless\" dataset, embedding-based RMs consistently matched LLM-based RMs.\n            *   On the \"Helpful\" dataset, embedding-based RMs underperformed relative to Gemma2B-based LLM RMs when annotation quality and availability were high \\cite{sun20250ae}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations:** While generally strong, embedding-based reward models may underperform larger LLM-based reward models on specific, complex tasks (e.g., \"Helpful\") when high-quality and abundant annotation data is available \\cite{sun20250ae}. Further research is needed to enhance their performance in such general setups \\cite{sun20250ae}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The approach is primarily focused on accelerating reward model *research* and evaluation, particularly for scenarios where computational resources are limited or rapid iteration is desired. It facilitates reproducible research without GPUs \\cite{sun20250ae}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** This work significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by democratizing reward model research, making it accessible to a wider community without requiring advanced, large-memory GPUs \\cite{sun20250ae}. It provides a robust, cost-effective, and reproducible alternative to computationally intensive LLM-based reward modeling \\cite{sun20250ae}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:** It enables faster prototyping, more reliable statistical validation of new algorithms, and encourages systematic comparisons. The proposed standardized, reusable datasets for evaluation can accelerate the pace of discovery and foster more rigorous scientific inquiry in LLM alignment research \\cite{sun20250ae}. It also facilitates scalable inference-time optimization and lightweight deployment for LLM-free service providers \\cite{sun20250ae}.",

Subsequent investigations into enhancing their visual reasoning abilities have significantly expanded their performance envelope. However, a critical bottleneck in the advancement of MLLMs toward deep visual reasoning is their heavy reliance on curated image-text supervision. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework, ``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback''(RRVF), that enables MLLMs to learn complex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on the ``Asymmetry of Verification''principle, i.e., verifying the rendered output against the source image is substantially easier than performing deep visual reasoning to generate a faithful, structured representation such as code. We demonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL), thereby reducing reliance on image-text supervision. RRVF implements a closed-loop iterative process encompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual feedback components, enabling the model to perform complex reasoning, including self-correction through multi-turn interactions. This process is optimized end-to-end using the GRPO algorithm. Extensive evaluations are conducted on image-to-code generation across two diverse domains: data charts and web interfaces. The RRVF-trained model not only outperforms existing similarly sized open-source MLLMs and supervised fine-tuning baselines but also exhibits superior generalization. Notably, the model outperforms the more advanced MLLM used to generate visual feedback during training. Code is available at https://github.com/L-O-I/RRVF.",

    "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review, emphasizing technical innovations and empirical validation:\n\n*   **1. Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Ensuring the functional correctness of Verilog code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) from natural language descriptions \\cite{wang20252c7}. While LLMs show strong performance in Verilog generation, functional correctness remains a significant challenge.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: Functional correctness is the fundamental goal of hardware design. The main obstacle is the lack of sufficient functional verification data, specifically testbenches paired with design specifications and code, which makes direct application of verification-based supervision difficult \\cite{wang20252c7}. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) alone does not guarantee functional correctness, as its objective (perplexity) does not measure overall functional assessment \\cite{wang20252c7}.\n\n*   **2. Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Previous works like RTLCoder, BetterV, CodeV, AutoVCoder, HaVen, and OriGen have advanced LLM-based Verilog generation, often focusing on dataset generation, self-reflection, or hallucination reduction \\cite{wang20252c7}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: None of these prior approaches explicitly use *verification insights* from testbenches to train a Verilog generation LLM for improved *functional correctness* \\cite{wang20252c7}. While VeriSeek uses code structure similarity as a reward for PPO training, this reward does not guarantee functional correctness, and reward-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) is prone to \"reward hacking\" \\cite{wang20252c7}.\n\n*   **3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper introduces a method that integrates verification insights from testbenches into the training of Verilog generation LLMs, aligning the training with functional correctness \\cite{wang20252c7}. This is achieved through a two-stage process: initial Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) with testbench feedback.\n    *   **Novelty/Differentiation**:\n        *   **Automatic Testbench Generation Pipeline**: A novel pipeline is introduced that decomposes the testbench generation process into subtasks (Analyze, Draft, Improve, Rectify) and incorporates real verification feedback from a Verilog Compiler Simulator (VCS) to reduce hallucination and ensure correctness \\cite{wang20252c7}.\n        *   **Verification-Driven Preference Pair Collection**: The method uses the automatically generated testbenches to evaluate LLM-generated Verilog code, collecting \"preference pairs\" where code passing more test cases is designated as \"preferred\" and code passing fewer as \"less preferred\" \\cite{wang20252c7}.\n        *   **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for Functional Correctness**: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), an RL algorithm, is applied to train the LLM directly from these testbench-derived preference pairs. This approach avoids explicit reward modeling, mitigating the risk of reward hacking and directly optimizing for functional correctness \\cite{wang20252c7}.\n\n*   **4. Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms, Methods, or Techniques**:\n        *   An automatic testbench generation pipeline that leverages decomposition and real VCS feedback for practicality and robustness \\cite{wang20252c7}.\n        *   A novel application of Reinforcement Learning, specifically DPO, to align Verilog generation LLMs with functional correctness using testbench outcomes as preference signals \\cite{wang20252c7}.\n    *   **System Design or Architectural Innovations**: The integration of verification insights into the LLM training process, addressing a critical aspect of hardware design often overlooked by previous work \\cite{wang20252c7}. The overall framework combines SFT with a verification-feedback-driven RL stage.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights or Analysis**: Demonstrates that DPO can effectively learn from preference pairs derived from functional verification results, guiding the model to produce functionally correct outputs without the complexities and pitfalls of explicit reward function design \\cite{wang20252c7}.\n\n*   **5. Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: The approach was evaluated on multiple established benchmarks: VerilogEval-Machine, VerilogEval-Human, RTLLM v1.1, RTLLM v2, and VerilogEval v2 \\cite{wang20252c7}. Ablation studies were performed to compare different strategies for constructing preference pairs and various RL algorithms.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   The proposed approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (general, coding, and Verilog generation LLMs) in generating *functionally correct* Verilog code across all evaluated benchmarks \\cite{wang20252c7}.\n        *   The application of DPO leads to substantial improvements across all variants of the model (different structures, families, and sizes) \\cite{wang20252c7}.\n        *   Ablation studies confirm that DPO with testbench-derived preference pairs achieves the best performance compared to alternative strategies and RL algorithms \\cite{wang20252c7}.\n        *   It was shown that SFT with verified data alone does not achieve the same improvements as RL, highlighting the importance of the RL objective for functional correctness \\cite{wang20252c7}.\n\n*   **6. Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations or Assumptions**: The automatic testbench generation pipeline, while robust, \"cannot guarantee testbenches that cover all functional cases,\" but it provides sufficient basic functional verification for training \\cite{wang20252c7}. The method discards preference pairs where either generated code fails to compile, to avoid negatively impacting learning performance \\cite{wang20252c7}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The method is specifically designed for Verilog code generation from natural language specifications, focusing on improving functional correctness in this domain \\cite{wang20252c7}.\n\n*   **7.

    "intriguing_abstract": "The promise of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated hardware design hinges critically on generating functionally correct Verilog. Yet, achieving this fundamental goal has remained a significant challenge, largely due to the scarcity of verification-specific training data and the limitations of traditional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We introduce a novel framework that directly aligns LLM training with functional correctness by integrating real verification insights.\n\nOur approach features an innovative automatic testbench generation pipeline, leveraging Verilog Compiler Simulator (VCS) feedback to create robust test environments.

This unique methodology allows us to directly optimize for functional correctness, circumventing the complexities and 'reward hacking' risks associated with explicit reward modeling. Evaluated across multiple industry benchmarks (VerilogEval, RTLLM), our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs, delivering substantial improvements in generating functionally correct Verilog code. This work represents the first successful integration of comprehensive verification feedback into LLM training for hardware description languages (HDL), setting a new paradigm for reliable automated hardware design and open-sourcing resources for future research.",

However, ensuring the functional correctness of the generated code remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a method that integrates verification insights from testbench into the training of Verilog generation LLMs, aligning the training with the fundamental goal of hardware design: functional correctness. The main obstacle in using LLMs for Verilog code generation is the lack of sufficient functional verification data, particularly testbenches paired with design specifications and code. To address this problem, we introduce an automatic testbench generation pipeline that decomposes the process and uses feedback from the Verilog compiler simulator (VCS) to reduce hallucination and ensure correctness. We then use the testbench to evaluate the generated codes and collect them for further training, where verification insights are introduced. Our method applies reinforcement learning (RL), specifically direct preference optimization (DPO), to align Verilog code generation with functional correctness by training preference pairs based on testbench outcomes. In evaluations on VerilogEval-Machine, VerilogEval-Human, RTLLM v1.1, RTLLM v2, and VerilogEval v2, our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating functionally correct Verilog code.

      "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review, emphasizing technical innovations and empirical validation:\n\n*   **1. Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Ensuring the functional correctness of Verilog code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) from natural language descriptions \\cite{wang20252c7}. While LLMs show strong performance in Verilog generation, functional correctness remains a significant challenge.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: Functional correctness is the fundamental goal of hardware design. The main obstacle is the lack of sufficient functional verification data, specifically testbenches paired with design specifications and code, which makes direct application of verification-based supervision difficult \\cite{wang20252c7}. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) alone does not guarantee functional correctness, as its objective (perplexity) does not measure overall functional assessment \\cite{wang20252c7}.\n\n*   **2. Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Previous works like RTLCoder, BetterV, CodeV, AutoVCoder, HaVen, and OriGen have advanced LLM-based Verilog generation, often focusing on dataset generation, self-reflection, or hallucination reduction \\cite{wang20252c7}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: None of these prior approaches explicitly use *verification insights* from testbenches to train a Verilog generation LLM for improved *functional correctness* \\cite{wang20252c7}. While VeriSeek uses code structure similarity as a reward for PPO training, this reward does not guarantee functional correctness, and reward-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) is prone to \"reward hacking\" \\cite{wang20252c7}.\n\n*   **3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper introduces a method that integrates verification insights from testbenches into the training of Verilog generation LLMs, aligning the training with functional correctness \\cite{wang20252c7}. This is achieved through a two-stage process: initial Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) with testbench feedback.\n    *   **Novelty/Differentiation**:\n        *   **Automatic Testbench Generation Pipeline**: A novel pipeline is introduced that decomposes the testbench generation process into subtasks (Analyze, Draft, Improve, Rectify) and incorporates real verification feedback from a Verilog Compiler Simulator (VCS) to reduce hallucination and ensure correctness \\cite{wang20252c7}.\n        *   **Verification-Driven Preference Pair Collection**: The method uses the automatically generated testbenches to evaluate LLM-generated Verilog code, collecting \"preference pairs\" where code passing more test cases is designated as \"preferred\" and code passing fewer as \"less preferred\" \\cite{wang20252c7}.\n        *   **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for Functional Correctness**: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), an RL algorithm, is applied to train the LLM directly from these testbench-derived preference pairs. This approach avoids explicit reward modeling, mitigating the risk of reward hacking and directly optimizing for functional correctness \\cite{wang20252c7}.\n\n*   **4. Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms, Methods, or Techniques**:\n        *   An automatic testbench generation pipeline that leverages decomposition and real VCS feedback for practicality and robustness \\cite{wang20252c7}.\n        *   A novel application of Reinforcement Learning, specifically DPO, to align Verilog generation LLMs with functional correctness using testbench outcomes as preference signals \\cite{wang20252c7}.\n    *   **System Design or Architectural Innovations**: The integration of verification insights into the LLM training process, addressing a critical aspect of hardware design often overlooked by previous work \\cite{wang20252c7}. The overall framework combines SFT with a verification-feedback-driven RL stage.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights or Analysis**: Demonstrates that DPO can effectively learn from preference pairs derived from functional verification results, guiding the model to produce functionally correct outputs without the complexities and pitfalls of explicit reward function design \\cite{wang20252c7}.\n\n*   **5. Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: The approach was evaluated on multiple established benchmarks: VerilogEval-Machine, VerilogEval-Human, RTLLM v1.1, RTLLM v2, and VerilogEval v2 \\cite{wang20252c7}. Ablation studies were performed to compare different strategies for constructing preference pairs and various RL algorithms.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   The proposed approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (general, coding, and Verilog generation LLMs) in generating *functionally correct* Verilog code across all evaluated benchmarks \\cite{wang20252c7}.\n        *   The application of DPO leads to substantial improvements across all variants of the model (different structures, families, and sizes) \\cite{wang20252c7}.\n        *   Ablation studies confirm that DPO with testbench-derived preference pairs achieves the best performance compared to alternative strategies and RL algorithms \\cite{wang20252c7}.\n        *   It was shown that SFT with verified data alone does not achieve the same improvements as RL, highlighting the importance of the RL objective for functional correctness \\cite{wang20252c7}.\n\n*   **6. Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations or Assumptions**: The automatic testbench generation pipeline, while robust, \"cannot guarantee testbenches that cover all functional cases,\" but it provides sufficient basic functional verification for training \\cite{wang20252c7}. The method discards preference pairs where either generated code fails to compile, to avoid negatively impacting learning performance \\cite{wang20252c7}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The method is specifically designed for Verilog code generation from natural language specifications, focusing on improving functional correctness in this domain \\cite{wang20252c7}.\n\n*   **7. Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: This work is the first to align LLMs with the fundamental goal of Verilog generation – functional correctness – by integrating verification insights and employing reinforcement learning with testbench feedback \\cite{wang20252c7}. It significantly advances the state-of-the-art in generating functionally correct HDL code.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: The paper provides a strong baseline and open-sources all training code, data, and models, promoting further research in verification-aware LLM training for hardware design \\cite{wang20252c7}.

In this work, we propose a self-supervised inverse dynamics task to enable VLMs to learn from GUI transition pairs by inferring the action that caused that transition. This training task offers two advantages: (1) It enables VLMs to ignore variations unrelated to user actions (e.g., background refreshes, ads) and to focus on true affordances such as buttons and input fields within complex GUIs.

However, concentrating on specific tasks can be very inefficient for large-scale LLMs to be used, because of the expensive cost of training and inference stages they need in terms of computational resources. This study introduces a novel framework for training smaller language models in function calling, focusing on specific logical and mathematical reasoning tasks. The approach aims to improve performances of small-scale models for these tasks using function calling, ensuring a high level of accuracy. Our framework employs an agent that, given a problem and a set of callable functions, queries the LLM by injecting a description and examples of the usable functions into the prompt and managing their calls in a step-by-step reasoning chain. This process is used to create a dataset of correct and incorrect reasoning chain chat completions from a large-scale LLM. This dataset is used to train a smaller LLM using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), specifically employing the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) technique. Experimental results demonstrate how the proposed approach balances the trade-off between model size and performance, improving the ability of function calling for reasoning tasks, in smaller models.",

However, existing RLHF methods require a high computational cost, one main reason being that RLHF assigns both the generation and alignment tasks to the LLM simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce Proxy-RLHF, which decouples the generation and alignment processes of LLMs, achieving alignment with human values at a much lower computational cost. We start with a novel Markov Decision Process (MDP) designed for the alignment process and employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train a streamlined proxy model that oversees the token generation of the LLM, without altering the LLM itself. Experiments show that our method achieves a comparable level of alignment with only 1\\% of the training parameters of other methods.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a transformative approach for aligning and enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing critical challenges in instruction following, ethical alignment, and reasoning capabilities. This survey offers a comprehensive foundation on the integration of RL with language models, highlighting prominent algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Q-Learning, and Actor-Critic methods. Additionally, it provides an extensive technical overview of RL techniques specifically tailored for LLMs, including foundational methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and AI Feedback (RLAIF), as well as advanced strategies such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We systematically analyze their applications across domains, i.e., from code generation to tool-augmented reasoning. We also present a comparative taxonomy based on reward modeling, feedback mechanisms, and optimization strategies. Our evaluation highlights key trends. RLHF remains dominant for alignment, and outcome-based RL such as RLVR significantly improves stepwise reasoning. However, persistent challenges such as reward hacking, computational costs, and scalable feedback collection underscore the need for continued innovation. We further discuss emerging directions, including hybrid RL algorithms, verifier-guided training, and multi-objective alignment frameworks. This survey serves as a roadmap for researchers advancing RL-driven LLM development, balancing capability enhancement with safety and scalability.",

However, existing RLHF methods are non-robust, and their performance deteriorates if the downstream task differs significantly from the preference dataset used in fine-tuning. In order to mitigate this problem, we introduce a distributionally robust RLHF for fine-tuning LLMs. In particular, our goal is to ensure that a fine-tuned model retains its performance even when the distribution of prompts significantly differs from the distribution encountered during fine-tuning. We formulate distributionally robust optimization (DRO) version of two popular fine-tuning methods -- (1) reward-based RLHF and (2) reward-free DPO (direct preference optimization). We propose a minibatch gradient descent based algorithms for both of them, and theoretically prove convergence guarantees for the algorithms. Subsequently, we evaluate our algorithms on an out-of-distribution (OOD) task by first training the model on the Unified-Feedback dataset and evaluating its performance on two different datasets. The experimental results show that our robust training improves the accuracy of the learned reward models on average, and markedly on some tasks, such as reasoning. Furthermore, we show that the robust versions of policy optimization methods, similarly improve performance on OOD tasks.",

    "intriguing_abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are celebrated for their advanced capabilities, yet persistent vulnerabilities like jailbreaks, hallucinations, and comprehension errors continue to compromise their safety and reliability. This paper uncovers a surprising, overlooked vector: the profound impact of *non-standard Unicode characters* on LLM security and comprehension. We introduce a novel methodology, systematically testing 15 state-of-the-art LLMs with prompts constructed from 24 diverse non-standard Unicode sets, including Blackboard Bold, Fraktur, Monospace, and Zalgo text. Our empirical analysis reveals that these seemingly innocuous characters dramatically reduce the efficacy of RLHF-implemented guardrails, leading to widespread prompt leakage and content policy violations across models like Llama-3, Mixtral, and Claude 3 Sonnet. Furthermore, we document unique and often bizarre hallucination patterns, from GPT-3.5 generating Python code to Gemma-7B producing offensive content. These findings highlight critical gaps in current LLM training data, demonstrating that existing safety mechanisms are insufficient against this subtle input manipulation. This research underscores an urgent need to integrate diverse Unicode text into training paradigms to enhance LLM robustness, true language comprehension, and fortify defenses against novel attack vectors.",

      "abstract": "The advancement of large language models has significantly improved natural language processing. However, challenges such as jailbreaks (prompt injections that cause an LLM to follow instructions contrary to its intended use), hallucinations (generating incorrect or misleading information), and comprehension errors remain prevalent. In this report, we present a comparative analysis of the performance of fifteen distinct models, with each model undergoing a standardized test comprising 38 queries across three key metrics: jailbreaks, hallucinations, and comprehension errors. The models are assessed based on the total occurrences of jailbreaks, hallucinations, and comprehension errors. Our work exposes these models' inherent vulnerabilities and challenges the notion of human-level language comprehension of these models. We have empirically analysed the impact of non-standard Unicode characters on LLMs and their safeguarding mechanisms on the best-performing LLMs, including GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro, LlaMA-3-70B, and Claude 3 Opus. By incorporating alphanumeric symbols from Unicode outside the standard Latin block and variants of characters in other languages, we observed a reduction in the efficacy of guardrails implemented through Reinforcement Learning Human Feedback (RLHF). Consequently, these models exhibit heightened vulnerability to content policy breaches and prompt leakage. Our study also suggests a need to incorporate non-standard Unicode text in LLM training data to enhance the capabilities of these models.",

This \"sequence-to-one\" approach overlooks the fine-grained contributions of individual tokens, hindering efficient optimization of Large Language Models (LLMs).\n    *   **Importance**: As LLMs become more complex, effective alignment with human preferences is critical to mitigate risks (bias, misinformation, harm). The current sparse reward structure makes it difficult for LLMs to learn which specific parts of a generation are good or bad, leading to inefficient training and suboptimal alignment.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches**: Standard RLHF paradigms (e.g., PPO, RLOO) rely on a single scalar reward at the end of a sequence.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: These methods suffer from sparse and delayed rewards, making credit assignment challenging, especially for long generation sequences where initial tokens significantly influence subsequent ones. The paper specifically contrasts with \"attention-based credits (ABC)\" \\cite{chan2024attention}, noting its ineffectiveness in experiments, suggesting that attention weights alone may not fully capture true token contributions.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Method**: The paper proposes RED (REward reDistribution), a novel approach that assigns fine-grained, token-level rewards by redistributing the holistic sequence-level reward.\n    *   **Mechanism**: It leverages an off-the-shelf reward model to predict scores at each timestep (i.e., after each token is generated). The token-level reward `˜rRM_t` is computed as the incremental impact of the current token on the reward model's score compared to the previous timestep: `˜rRM_t = Rϕ(x, y≤t) - Rϕ(x, y≤t-1)`.\n    *   **Innovation**:\n        *   **No Reward Model Modification**: RED does not require retraining or modifying the existing reward model.

Typically, a reward model is trained or supplied to act as a proxy for humans in evaluating generated responses during the reinforcement training phase. However, current reward models operate as sequence-to-one models, allocating a single, sparse, and delayed reward to an entire output sequence. This approach may overlook the significant contributions of individual tokens toward the desired outcome. To this end, we propose a more fine-grained, token-level guidance approach for RL training. Specifically, we introduce RED, a novel reward redistribition method that evaluates and assigns specific credit to each token using an off-the-shelf reward model. Utilizing these fine-grained rewards enhances the model's understanding of language nuances, leading to more precise performance improvements. Notably, our method does not require modifying the reward model or introducing additional training steps, thereby incurring minimal computational costs. Experimental results across diverse datasets and tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach.",

It simply utilizes the reward model's ability to output scores based on partial sequences.\n        *   **Minimal Computational Costs**: The redistribution process incurs minimal additional computational overhead as it reuses existing model components.\n        *   **Seamless Integration**: The method is designed for easy application across most mainstream RLHF paradigms (e.g., PPO, RLOO) with minimal modifications.\n        *   **Convex Combination**: Introduces a hyperparameter `βc` to combine token-wise and sequence-wise rewards, allowing for a trade-off during training.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithm**: The RED (REward reDistribution) method for transforming sparse, delayed sequence rewards into dense, immediate token-level rewards.\n    *   **Credit Assignment Mechanism**: A novel way to assign credit to individual tokens based on their marginal contribution to the reward model's score over time.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights**:\n        *   **Sequence-MDP Framework**: Demonstrates that RED operates within the Sequence-Markov Decision Process (SDP) framework, where rewards can be non-Markovian but the total return is preserved.\n        *   **Preservation of Optimal Policy**: Provides theoretical justification that the optimal policy remains unchanged, interpreting the redistributed rewards as a form of potential-based reward shaping \\cite{ng1999potential} and arguing for return-equivalence within constrained RL.\n        *   **Desirable Training Properties**: Highlights properties like dynamic reward initialization, convergence guarantee under standard assumptions, and robustness to the specific redistribution strategy.\n    *   **System Design**: A highly compatible and computationally efficient design that enhances existing RLHF pipelines without requiring significant architectural changes or additional training.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Comprehensive experiments across diverse tasks: question answering (Nectar dataset), summarization, and harmfulness mitigation & helpfulness enhancement.\n    *   **Base Models**: Evaluated on popular open-source LLMs: LLaMA-7B, LLaMA3-8B, and Qwen2.5-7B.\n    *   **Baselines**: Compared against standard RLHF algorithms like PPO \\cite{ouyang2022training} and RLOO \\cite{ahmadian2024rlhf}, as well as other reward shaping techniques (Reward Shaping, Lagrangian method) and attention-based credits (ABC) \\cite{chan2024attention}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**: Average reward scores, reward win rates (against baselines), and GPT-4 evaluation scores (as a proxy for human preference).\n    *   **Comparison Results**:\n        *   **Consistent Superiority**: RED consistently improved baseline methods across all base models and tasks, achieving the highest reward scores, win rates, and GPT-evaluation scores.\n        *   **Effectiveness of Dense Rewards**: The results empirically validate that providing dense, token-level rewards effectively guides the learning process of LLMs.\n        *   **Ineffectiveness of ABC**: Notably, another reward redistribution method, Attention-based Credits (ABC), failed to deliver desirable performance and even underperformed the original PPO baseline in the question answering task, suggesting that attention weights may not adequately capture true token credits.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**: While the paper argues for the preservation of optimal policy, it acknowledges that the `˜rRM−1` term (reward for the initial prompt alone) could introduce a potential for bias, though it justifies this by classifying it within the same equivalence class of reward functions. The effectiveness is inherently tied to the quality of the underlying reward model.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The method is broadly applicable to mainstream RLHF paradigms for various language generation tasks.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: RED significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in RLHF by addressing the fundamental limitation of sparse and delayed rewards, providing a more efficient and precise learning signal for LLMs.\n    *   **Potential Impact**: By enabling fine-grained, token-level credit assignment, RED can lead to more accurate fine-tuning of language models, resulting in performance improvements that are more closely aligned with human feedback and preferences. This could accelerate research in LLM alignment and control.",
