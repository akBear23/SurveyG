        "abstract": "BackgroundArtificial intelligence (AI) research in healthcare is accelerating rapidly, with potential applications being demonstrated across various domains of medicine. However, there are currently limited examples of such techniques being successfully deployed into clinical practice. This article explores the main challenges and limitations of AI in healthcare, and considers the steps required to translate these potentially transformative technologies from research to clinical practice.Main bodyKey challenges for the translation of AI systems in healthcare include those intrinsic to the science of machine learning, logistical difficulties in implementation, and consideration of the barriers to adoption as well as of the necessary sociocultural or pathway changes. Robust peer-reviewed clinical evaluation as part of randomised controlled trials should be viewed as the gold standard for evidence generation, but conducting these in practice may not always be appropriate or feasible. Performance metrics should aim to capture real clinical applicability and be understandable to intended users. Regulation that balances the pace of innovation with the potential for harm, alongside thoughtful post-market surveillance, is required to ensure that patients are not exposed to dangerous interventions nor deprived of access to beneficial innovations. Mechanisms to enable direct comparisons of AI systems must be developed, including the use of independent, local and representative test sets. Developers of AI algorithms must be vigilant to potential dangers, including dataset shift, accidental fitting of confounders, unintended discriminatory bias, the challenges of generalisation to new populations, and the unintended negative consequences of new algorithms on health outcomes.ConclusionThe safe and timely translation of AI research into clinically validated and appropriately regulated systems that can benefit everyone is challenging. Robust clinical evaluation, using metrics that are intuitive to clinicians and ideally go beyond measures of technical accuracy to include quality of care and patient outcomes, is essential. Further work is required (1) to identify themes of algorithmic bias and unfairness while developing mitigations to address these, (2) to reduce brittleness and improve generalisability, and (3) to develop methods for improved interpretability of machine learning predictions. If these goals can be achieved, the benefits for patients are likely to be transformational.",

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   The paper addresses the problem of discrimination in predictive models, particularly in sensitive applications like healthcare or criminal justice, where a trade-off between fairness and accuracy is often undesirable and can have severe consequences \\cite{kelly2019gw7}.\n    *   It argues that existing approaches primarily focus on constraining models, which can sacrifice predictive accuracy. The core challenge is to understand *why* a classifier is discriminatory and address the root causes, rather than just mitigating symptoms \\cite{kelly2019gw7}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   Previous work on fairness has largely focused on model-based approaches (regularization, constraints, representation learning) or data preprocessing to reduce discrimination \\cite{kelly2019gw7}.\n    *   Limitations of these solutions include an inevitable trade-off with predictive accuracy, which is problematic in high-stakes decisions. Post-hoc correction methods, especially those involving randomization, are deemed ethically unjustifiable in clinical tasks and may lead to suboptimal accuracy \\cite{kelly2019gw7}.\n    *   This work positions itself by arguing that the impact of data collection on discrimination has received comparatively little attention, and that fairness should be evaluated in the context of the data itself \\cite{kelly2019gw7}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   The core technical method is to decompose cost-based metrics of discrimination (e.g., differences in FPR, FNR, zero-one loss, or MSE across protected groups) into three distinct components: bias, variance, and noise \\cite{kelly2019gw7}.\n    *   This approach is novel because it allows for separating the adverse impact of inadequate data collection (leading to differences in variance or noise) from the choice of the model (leading to differences in bias) \\cite{kelly2019gw7}.\n    *   It proposes that the \"cost of fairness\" need not always be a reduction in predictive accuracy, but rather an investment in data collection and model development \\cite{kelly2019gw7}. The analysis uses an \"expected discrimination level\" over random training sets to account for sampling variability \\cite{kelly2019gw7}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**: A procedure for analyzing discrimination in predictive models using bias-variance-noise decompositions for cost-based group fairness definitions \\cite{kelly2019gw7}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights**: Theorem 1 formally establishes the decomposition of group-specific losses and the overall discrimination level into noise, bias, and variance components \\cite{kelly2019gw7}. Proposition 1 demonstrates that if noise differs between protected groups, no model can be 0-discriminatory without additional information or increasing bias/variance \\cite{kelly2019gw7}.\n    *   **Practical Procedures**:\n        *   Procedures for estimating the value of collecting additional training samples by analyzing \"discrimination learning curves\" (how discrimination changes with training set size) \\cite{kelly2019gw7}.\n        *   A method using clustering to identify subpopulations with high discrimination, guiding the collection of additional predictive variables \\cite{kelly2019gw7}.\n    *   Statistical tests for discrimination level and differences between models are also mentioned (in supplementary material) \\cite{kelly2019gw7}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   Experiments were conducted on three diverse tasks: predicting income from census data, predicting patient mortality in critical care, and predicting book review ratings from text \\cite{kelly2019gw7}.\n    *   Key performance metrics included group-specific zero-one loss, false positive rates (FPR), false negative rates (FNR), and mean-squared error (for regression), with discrimination measured as the absolute difference between these group-specific costs \\cite{kelly2019gw7}.\n    *   Key findings confirmed the value of the bias-variance-noise analysis. The authors found that data collection is often a means to reduce discrimination *without sacrificing accuracy* \\cite{kelly2019gw7}. For instance, mortality predictions for cancer patients showed up to 20% accuracy variation between protected groups, and discrimination levels were sensitive to training data quality \\cite{kelly2019gw7}. Inverse power-laws were found to model group-conditional and class-conditional errors effectively for extrapolating learning curves \\cite{kelly2019gw7}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   The work assumes that observed differences in predictive power are considered discriminatory and does not delve into causal inference to determine *which* differences are unfair \\cite{kelly2019gw7}.\n    *   It explicitly states that correcting for data provenance and historical bias in labels is outside its scope \\cite{kelly2019gw7}.\n    *   The decomposition does not directly apply to post-hoc randomization methods, though they can be interpreted as increasing variance \\cite{kelly2019gw7}.\n    *   Estimating noise and bias can be challenging in high-dimensional or continuous feature spaces without further assumptions \\cite{kelly2019gw7}.\n    *   The paper acknowledges the impossibility results in fairness, implying a choice between fairness criteria \\cite{kelly2019gw7}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   This work significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing a diagnostic framework to understand the *sources* of discrimination (data-driven vs. model-driven) rather than just offering mitigation strategies \\cite{kelly2019gw7}.\n    *   Its potential impact on future research and practice is substantial, as it shifts the focus towards data collection and quality as primary levers for achieving fairness and accuracy simultaneously, especially in high-stakes domains \\cite{kelly2019gw7}. It provides concrete tools (learning curves, clustering for variable collection) to guide these data-centric interventions \\cite{kelly2019gw7}.",

However, the reporting of these early studies remains inadequate. The present statement provides a multistakeholder, consensus-based reporting guideline for the Developmental and Exploratory Clinical Investigations of DEcision support systems driven by Artificial Intelligence (DECIDE-AI). We conducted a two round, modified Delphi process to collect and analyse expert opinion on the reporting of early clinical evaluation of AI systems. Experts were recruited from 20 predefined stakeholder categories. The final composition and wording of the guideline was determined at a virtual consensus meeting. The checklist and the Explanation & Elaboration (E&E) sections were refined based on feedback from a qualitative evaluation process. 123 experts participated in the first round of Delphi, 138 in the second, 16 in the consensus meeting, and 16 in the qualitative evaluation. The DECIDE-AI reporting guideline comprises 17 AI specific reporting items (made of 28 subitems) and 10 generic reporting items, with an E&E paragraph provided for each. Through consultation and consensus with a range of stakeholders, we have developed a guideline comprising key items that should be reported in early stage clinical studies of AI-based decision support systems in healthcare. By providing an actionable checklist of minimal reporting items, the DECIDE-AI guideline will facilitate the appraisal of these studies and replicability of their findings.",

The present statement provides a multistakeholder, consensus-based reporting guideline for the Developmental and Exploratory Clinical Investigations of DEcision support systems driven by Artificial Intelligence (DECIDE-AI). We conducted a two round, modified Delphi process to collect and analyse expert opinion on the reporting of early clinical evaluation of AI systems. Experts were recruited from 20 predefined stakeholder categories. The final composition and wording of the guideline was determined at a virtual consensus meeting. The checklist and the Explanation & Elaboration (E&E) sections were refined based on feedback from a qualitative evaluation process. 123 experts participated in the first round of Delphi, 138 in the second, 16 in the consensus meeting, and 16 in the qualitative evaluation. The DECIDE-AI reporting guideline comprises 17 AI specific reporting items (made of 28 subitems) and 10 generic reporting items, with an E&E paragraph provided for each. Through consultation and consensus with a range of stakeholders, we have developed a guideline comprising key items that should be reported in early stage clinical studies of AI-based decision support systems in healthcare. By providing an actionable checklist of minimal reporting items, the DECIDE-AI guideline will facilitate the appraisal of these studies and replicability of their findings.",

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review, adhering to the citation requirements and focusing on technical aspects:\n\n**CITATION**: \\cite{vasey2022oig}\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific technical problem**: The paper addresses the critical problem of \"use error\" in medical devices, including drug-device combination products, which can lead to patient harm. This is fundamentally a human-system interaction problem where device design, user characteristics, and the use environment contribute to errors.\n    *   **Importance and challenge**: The problem is important because medical devices are increasingly complex, diverse, and used in varied environments (e.g., hospitals, homes) by users with diverse skill levels (e.g., professionals, lay users, patients, carers). This complexity and diversity heighten the potential for use errors (e.g., overdoses, incorrect therapy, dangerous delays), making robust human factors integration challenging but essential for patient safety.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to existing approaches**: The guidance positions itself as consistent with established human factors principles applied in high-hazard industries (e.g., defence, nuclear) and growing recognition in healthcare. It aligns with existing FDA guidance on human factors for medical devices and international standards, specifically referencing BS EN 62366 Part 1 2015: Application of usability engineering to medical devices.\n    *   **Limitations of previous solutions**: The document implicitly addresses a limitation in the *application* of human factors: a lack of consistent and robust integration of usability engineering into medical device design and regulatory processes, which has historically contributed to preventable use errors. This guidance aims to clarify regulatory expectations to mitigate this gap.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core technical method or algorithm**: The core \"technical method\" advocated is the **usability engineering process**. This is an iterative, science-based methodology that applies knowledge from diverse subjects (e.g., anatomy, psychology, engineering) to design products that suit the user for safer and more effective use. It involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential patient and user safety risks throughout the device lifecycle, including post-market surveillance.\n    *   **Novelty or difference**: The paper's innovation lies not in proposing new human factors algorithms, but in providing **clarified regulatory guidance and interpretation** for applying established usability engineering principles specifically within the Great Britain medical device market (post-Brexit). It translates broad \"Essential Requirements\" from UK Medical Devices Regulations (derived from EU Directives) into practical expectations for manufacturers and UK Approved Bodies, emphasizing the iterative nature of design, testing, and validation.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel algorithms, methods, or techniques**: While not introducing novel algorithms, the paper's contribution is the **synthesis and practical interpretation** of existing human factors and usability engineering methodologies within a specific regulatory framework. It defines and contextualizes key terms like \"usability engineering,\" \"use error,\" \"abnormal use,\" \"user,\" and \"user interface\" for medical device development.\n    *   **System design or architectural innovations**: Not applicable to a guidance document.\n    *   **Theoretical insights or analysis**: The document provides a detailed **regulatory interpretation** of how human factors requirements are embedded within the UK Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (and underlying EU Directives), highlighting specific Essential Requirements (e.g., ER 1, ER 9.2, ER 10.2, ER 13.1) that mandate ergonomic design and consideration of user characteristics and use environment.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments conducted**: The paper *does not present* experimental results from studies conducted by the authors. Instead, it **outlines the types of human factors studies** (e.g., formative and summative evaluations) that manufacturers are expected to conduct as part of their usability engineering process to demonstrate safe and effective use. It notes that some of these studies may require ethics approval and application for a clinical investigation.\n    *   **Key performance metrics and comparison results**: Not applicable, as the paper is a guidance document, not a report on empirical research. It describes *what* manufacturers should validate, not *results* of such validation.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical limitations or assumptions**: The guidance is advisory, not prescriptive; manufacturers can propose alternative approaches. It applies to Great Britain only, with different rules for Northern Ireland. It is intended for the design of *future products* and changes to existing user interfaces, not devices already on the market. It assumes manufacturers will implement the recommended usability engineering process.\n    *   **Scope of applicability**: Primarily targets manufacturers of all device classes, developers of medical devices and drug-device combination products, and UK Approved Bodies. It is also relevant to those involved in procurement and risk management but does not apply to clinical decision-makers like physicians or NHS staff.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advance the technical state-of-the-art**: The paper significantly advances the **regulatory and practical application** of human factors within the medical device industry in Great Britain. By formalizing and clarifying expectations for integrating usability engineering throughout the device lifecycle, it aims to reduce use errors and improve patient safety.\n    *   **Potential impact on future research**: This guidance encourages manufacturers to conduct more rigorous and systematic human factors studies (formative and summative evaluations) and to integrate human factors into their design and post-market surveillance processes. This emphasis is likely to lead to a greater body of industry data and best practices, potentially informing future research into effective human-device interaction, iterative design methodologies, and the impact of post-market feedback in healthcare technology development.",

Despite a great deal of research in the development and validation of health care AI, only few applications have been actually implemented at the frontlines of clinical practice.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this study was to systematically review AI applications that have been implemented in real-life clinical practice.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a literature search in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central, and CINAHL to identify relevant articles published between January 2010 and May 2020. We also hand searched premier computer science journals and conferences as well as registered clinical trials. Studies were included if they reported AI applications that had been implemented in real-world clinical settings.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe identified 51 relevant studies that reported the implementation and evaluation of AI applications in clinical practice, of which 13 adopted a randomized controlled trial design and eight adopted an experimental design. The AI applications targeted various clinical tasks, such as screening or triage (n=16), disease diagnosis (n=16), risk analysis (n=14), and treatment (n=7). The most commonly addressed diseases and conditions were sepsis (n=6), breast cancer (n=5), diabetic retinopathy (n=4), and polyp and adenoma (n=4). Regarding the evaluation outcomes, we found that 26 studies examined the performance of AI applications in clinical settings, 33 studies examined the effect of AI applications on clinician outcomes, 14 studies examined the effect on patient outcomes, and one study examined the economic impact associated with AI implementation.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis review indicates that research on the clinical implementation of AI applications is still at an early stage despite the great potential. More research needs to assess the benefits and challenges associated with clinical AI applications through a more rigorous methodology.",

        "summary": "The provided content is \"Multimedia Appendix 1. Search strategy\" from a paper, not the main technical/research paper itself. This appendix details the methodology used to identify relevant literature for a larger study (likely a systematic review or meta-analysis). Therefore, the analysis below focuses on the *technical aspects of the search strategy* rather than novel AI algorithms, system designs, or empirical validation of such.\n\nHere's a focused summary of the search strategy presented in \\cite{yin20206qf}:\n\n*   **CITATION REQUIREMENTS**: Always use \"\\cite{yin20206qf}\" when referencing this paper.\n\n---\n\n**TECHNICAL PAPER ANALYSIS (of the Search Strategy in \\cite{yin20206qf})**\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific technical problem**: The document addresses the problem of systematically and comprehensively identifying relevant research literature on the clinical implementation, deployment, or adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) technologies.\n    *   **Importance and challenge**: This problem is critical for conducting robust systematic reviews or meta-analyses. It is challenging due to the interdisciplinary nature of the topic (computer science and medicine), requiring a broad search across diverse databases and the careful selection of keywords to capture both AI technologies and their real-world application in healthcare settings, while filtering out irrelevant studies.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to existing approaches**: The search strategy in \\cite{yin20206qf} employs established systematic review methodologies, utilizing Boolean logic, comprehensive keyword sets, and database-specific filters. It aligns with best practices for rigorous literature searching in health and computer sciences.\n    *   **Limitations of previous solutions**: While not explicitly stated, the detailed and multi-database nature of this strategy implicitly addresses limitations of less rigorous or ad-hoc literature searches, which might suffer from incomplete coverage, bias, or lack of reproducibility.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core technical method**: The core method is a multi-database, keyword-driven search strategy. It defines two main conceptual groups of keywords: (1) AI/ML/DL terms (e.g., \"artificial intelligence\", \"machine learning\", \"deep learning\") and (2) clinical implementation terms (e.g., \"clinical\", \"health\", \"implement\", \"deployment\", \"adoption\"). These groups are combined using Boolean \"AND\" logic, with terms within each group combined using \"OR\". Specific filters (e.g., full text, journal article, humans, English, date range from 2010 to 2020) are applied to refine the results.\n    *   **Novelty or difference**: The novelty lies in the *specific, detailed, and reproducible combination* of keywords, databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane Central), and filters meticulously tailored to the interdisciplinary domain of AI in clinical implementation. The strategy includes a method to refine PubMed results by subtracting a broader search from a more specific one to exclude certain publication types (e.g., reviews, systematic reviews), indicating a nuanced approach to filtering. The inclusion of a \"List of premium computer science journals and conferences\" suggests a potential secondary screening or targeted search approach, though its direct integration into the provided queries isn't explicitly detailed.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel algorithms, methods, or techniques**: The primary contribution is a *detailed, transparent, and reproducible search methodology* for identifying literature at the intersection of AI/ML/DL and clinical practice. This is a methodological contribution to literature review, providing a robust framework for evidence synthesis.\n    *   **System design or architectural innovations**: Not applicable, as this document describes a search strategy, not a system design.\n    *   **Theoretical insights or analysis**: Not applicable.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments conducted**: The \"experiments\" are the execution of the defined search queries across the specified databases.\n    *   **Key performance metrics and comparison results**: The results are quantified by the number of hits obtained from each database (e.g., PubMed n=6830, CINAHL n=839, Embase n=9124, Cochrane Central n=1152). These \"n=\" counts represent the volume of identified literature. There is no explicit comparison against alternative search strategies or a \"ground truth\" to validate the *completeness* or *precision* of this specific strategy, but the systematic nature and broad coverage imply its effectiveness.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical limitations or assumptions**:\n        *   **Language restriction**: Limited to English publications.\n        *   **Date range**: Restricted to publications from January 1, 2010, to May 31, 2020.\n        *   **Database coverage**: While comprehensive, it's limited to the specified databases and does not explicitly include other relevant sources like pre-print servers, grey literature, or specific conference proceedings (beyond what might be indexed in the databases).\n        *   **Keyword dependency**: The strategy's effectiveness relies entirely on the chosen keywords accurately capturing the target concepts.\n        *   **Publication type filters**: Specific filters (e.g., excluding \"Review, Systematic Review\" in PubMed query 2) might inadvertently exclude relevant content depending on the main paper's objectives.\n    *   **Scope of applicability**: This search strategy is specifically designed for identifying literature on AI/ML/DL implementation in clinical/health/medical contexts. It is highly tailored to this interdisciplinary domain.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of the technical state-of-the-art**: This document does not advance the technical state-of-the-art in AI or clinical implementation directly. Instead, it provides a rigorous and transparent methodology for *identifying* the state-of-the-art in a specific research area.\n    *   **Potential impact on future research**: It serves as a reproducible blueprint for future systematic reviews or meta-analyses focusing on the adoption and impact of AI in healthcare. Researchers can adapt or build upon this detailed strategy to ensure comprehensive literature identification in related fields, thereby contributing to more robust evidence synthesis.",

We believe that a rigorous clinical and societal response can only be mounted by using intelligence derived from a variety of data sources to better utilize scarce healthcare resources, provide personalized patient management plans, inform policy, and expedite clinical trials. In this paper, we introduce five of the most important challenges in responding to COVID-19 and show how each of them can be addressed by recent developments in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). We argue that the integration of these techniques into local, national, and international healthcare systems will save lives, and propose specific methods by which implementation can happen swiftly and efficiently.

Research Problem & Motivation**\n*   The COVID-19 global pandemic poses an overwhelming burden on healthcare systems, leading to severe scarcity of resources (e.g., testing kits, ICU beds, ventilators, personnel) that cannot be effectively managed by conventional approaches \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n*   The problem is critical due to the threat to health, infrastructure, and economies, coupled with the highly heterogeneous nature of COVID-19 disease progression and patient outcomes, which necessitates personalized interventions \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n*   Challenges include identifying high-risk individuals, developing personalized treatment plans, informing effective policy decisions, and expediting clinical trials, all under conditions of limited knowledge and rapidly evolving data \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n\n**2. Related Work & Positioning**\n*   The paper positions its proposed AI/ML solutions against limitations of existing methods, such as:\n    *   **Standard epidemiological approaches (e.g., Cox proportional hazards model):** These are often unable to effectively combine diverse data sources (demographic, social, longitudinal, imaging, multi-omics) for personalized risk prediction \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n    *   **Current risk-scoring methods (e.g., Charlson score):** These are described as crude, failing to capture subtle interactions between risk factors, and potentially missing new risk factors crucial for a novel disease like COVID-19 \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n    *   **One-size-fits-all treatment plans:** Developed at the population level, these are deemed ineffective for the highly heterogeneous COVID-19 patient population \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n    *   **Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs):** While standard, RCTs are slow, costly, and may fail to uncover specific subgroups for whom a treatment is most effective, especially for patient groups severely impacted by COVID-19 (e.g., elderly, those with comorbidities) \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n    *   **Simple rules of thumb:** These are often used for patient-level resource allocation (e.g., ICU admission/discharge) but lack the tailored approach needed for dynamic resource management \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n\n**3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n*   **Core Technical Method:** The paper advocates for the integration of advanced machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques across five key areas:\n    *   **Personalized Risk and Disease Progression Prediction:** Utilizes representation learning based on neural networks to merge diverse data (electronic health records, \"big data\" from cellular operators, traffic, social media) for accurate, personalized predictions of infection risk, adverse events, and disease trajectories \\cite{schaar2020xiv}. Automated ML is proposed for subtyping and discovering new risk factors.\n    *   **Dynamic Resource Allocation:** Employs AI-based early warning systems trained on temporal (longitudinal) data, capable of handling irregularly sampled data and imputing missing features (e.g., using mixtures of Gaussian processes, recurrent neural networks, state-space models, neural network-based point processes, Bayesian non-parametric approaches). Active sensing techniques are proposed for optimal measurement-level resource allocation \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n    *   **Personalized Patient Management and Treatment:** Leverages ML models (e.g., Gaussian processes, generative adversarial networks, deep neural networks) to learn individual-level treatment effects from observational data and answer \"what-if\" counterfactual questions about different treatment sequences and timings (e.g., using counterfactual recurrent networks) \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n    *   **Informing Policy Decisions:** Advocates for data-driven AI/ML to provide objective insights into policy effectiveness and design, enabling more coordinated and timely decisions \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n    *   **Expediting Clinical Trials:** Proposes ML methods for adaptive trial designs, allowing recruitment from identifiable subgroups and optimized assignment to treatment/control groups to accelerate learning and reduce subject requirements \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n*   **Novelty/Difference:** The approach is novel in its comprehensive, integrated framework for pandemic response, emphasizing:\n    *   The fusion of clinical and diverse \"big data\" social interaction data for systemic risk assessment \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n    *   A shift from static, population-level predictions to dynamic, personalized, and time-evolving risk and trajectory assessments \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n    *   The use of counterfactual reasoning to optimize individual treatment plans without relying solely on randomized trials \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n    *   The application of active sensing to optimize the value of information acquisition in healthcare settings \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n    *   Addressing critical underdeveloped research threads like transfer learning (to account for population differences) and uncertainty quantification (to provide confidence estimates for AI recommendations) specifically for pandemic contexts \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n\n**4. Key Technical Contributions**\n*   **Novel Algorithms, Methods, or Techniques:**\n    *   Proposes the application of advanced representation learning (neural networks) for integrating heterogeneous data sources (EHR, social big data) to predict individual and systemic risks \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n    *   Highlights automated ML for dynamic subtyping of COVID-19 and discovery of novel risk factors and their interactions \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n    *   Advocates for ML methods for individual-level competing risk assessment and dynamic disease trajectory prediction using longitudinal data \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n    *   Emphasizes AI-based early warning systems utilizing temporal models (e.g., Gaussian processes, RNNs, state-space models) for patient-level resource allocation and active sensing for measurement-level optimization \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n    *   Suggests ML models (e.g., GANs, deep neural networks) for learning personalized treatment effects from observational data and counterfactual recurrent networks for predicting health trajectories under different management plans \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n    *   Identifies the critical need for and potential of transfer learning and uncertainty quantification methods to ensure robustness and generalizability of AI in pandemic scenarios \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n*   **System Design or Architectural Innovations:** The paper outlines a vision for integrating these diverse ML/AI techniques into a cohesive system that can dynamically manage healthcare resources and inform decisions at individual, institutional, and governmental levels \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n*   **Theoretical Insights or Analysis:** It underscores the unique nature of pandemics as jeopardizing public health and social structures, necessitating a data-driven approach that merges clinical and social data, and moves beyond static, population-level assumptions to dynamic, personalized, and counterfactual-aware decision-making \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n\n**5. Experimental Validation**\n*   This paper is a perspective and review, outlining opportunities and proposing a framework; it does not present new experimental results or conduct novel empirical validation \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n*   However, it *references* existing literature and prior work where the proposed ML/AI techniques have demonstrated efficacy in related contexts:\n    *   \"Mature AI-based support systems for a number of chronic diseases already exist...\" \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n    *   ML methods for risk prediction and subtyping are cited as \"offering increasingly accurate subtypings\" and \"improved prediction accuracy compared to conventional epidemiological methods\" (e.g., Alaa and van der Schaar 2018; Lee et al. 2019; Zhang et al. 2020) \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n    *   AI-enabled early warning systems are noted as \"developed and tested, and have shown their efficacy in practice\" (e.g., Yoon et al. 2016; Lee et al. 2018) \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n    *   ML methods for adaptive clinical trials are stated to have \"significantly reduce error and achieve a prescribed level of confidence in findings, while also requiring fewer subjects\" \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n    *   Models for personalized treatment effects and counterfactual reasoning are referenced as capable of learning individual-level effects and predicting health trajectories (e.g., Ahmed et al. 2017; Yoon et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2020; Bica et al. 2020) \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n\n**6. Limitations & Scope**\n*   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The successful implementation relies on the availability and effective integration of diverse, often disparate, data sources (EHR, social big data) \\cite{schaar2020xiv}. It also assumes the ability to swiftly and efficiently deploy complex AI/ML systems into existing healthcare infrastructure \\cite{schaar2020xiv}. The paper acknowledges the inherent uncertainty and evolving nature of COVID-19, highlighting the need for further progress in transfer learning and uncertainty quantification to ensure model robustness and generalizability \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n*   **Scope of Applicability:** While primarily focused on the UK healthcare system, the paper explicitly states that the challenges and proposed methods are applicable to other countries \\cite{schaar2020xiv}. The scope covers a broad range of applications from individual patient management and resource allocation to institutional policy-making and global clinical trial acceleration \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n\n**7. Technical Significance**\n*   **Advance the Technical State-of-the-Art:** The paper significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing a comprehensive, forward-looking blueprint for leveraging advanced ML/AI to tackle the multifaceted challenges of a global pandemic \\cite{schaar2020xiv}. It moves beyond traditional, static approaches by advocating for dynamic, personalized, and data-driven decision-making across the entire healthcare spectrum, from prevention to treatment and policy \\cite{schaar2020xiv}. It highlights the critical role of integrating heterogeneous data and performing counterfactual reasoning in real-world, rapidly evolving health crises \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n*   **Potential Impact on Future Research:** This work is likely to stimulate extensive future research in:\n    *   Developing robust methods for integrating and learning from highly diverse, real-time, and often incomplete data streams for public health applications \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n    *   Advancing personalized medicine through dynamic risk prediction, competing risk assessment, and counterfactual reasoning for treatment optimization \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n    *   Designing and implementing adaptive clinical trials that are more efficient and capable of identifying treatment effects in specific patient subgroups \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n    *   Further developing transfer learning techniques to adapt AI models across different populations and evolving disease characteristics during pandemics \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n    *   Enhancing uncertainty quantification in AI models to provide reliable confidence estimates for critical healthcare decisions \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.\n    *   The development of integrated AI platforms for comprehensive pandemic preparedness and response strategies \\cite{schaar2020xiv}.",

At its current stage, discovering new drugs is still a very expensive and time-consuming process, requiring Phases I, II and III for clinical trials. Recently, machine learning techniques in Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially the deep learning techniques which allow a computational model to generate multiple layers, have been widely applied and achieved state-of-the-art performance in different fields, such as speech recognition, image classification, bioinformatics, etc. One very important application of these AI techniques is in the field of drug discovery.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe did a large-scale literature search on existing scientific websites (e.g, ScienceDirect, Arxiv) and startup companies to understand current status of machine learning techniques in drug discovery.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur experiments demonstrated that there are different patterns in machine learning fields and drug discovery fields. For example, keywords like prediction, brain, discovery, and treatment are usually in drug discovery fields. Also, the total number of papers published in drug discovery fields with machine learning techniques is increasing every year.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe main focus of this survey is to understand the current status of machine learning techniques in the drug discovery field within both academic and industrial settings, and discuss its potential future applications. Several interesting patterns for machine learning techniques in drug discovery fields are discussed in this survey.",

Although the widespread use of futuristic robotaxis and self-driving commercial vehicles has not yet become a reality, the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically accelerated the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in different fields. We have witnessed the equivalent of two years of digital transformation compressed into just a few months. Whether it is in tracing epidemiological peaks or in transacting contactless payments, the impact of these developments has been almost immediate, and a window has opened up on what is to come. Here we analyze and discuss how AI can support us in facing the ongoing pandemic. Despite the numerous and undeniable contributions of AI, clinical trials and human skills are still required. Even if different strategies have been developed in different states worldwide, the fight against the pandemic seems to have found everywhere a valuable ally in AI, a global and open-source tool capable of providing assistance in this health emergency.

This design explicitly addresses the challenges of AI adoption in critical healthcare settings.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: The paper's primary conceptual contribution is highlighting the necessity of viewing AI interventions as \"sociotechnical systems\" and recognizing the \"repair work\" (human labor and expertise) required to integrate disruptive technologies into existing professional contexts for effective innovation \\cite{piccialli2021d0v}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Sepsis Watch has been \"piloted and integrated... into routine clinical care\" at Duke University Hospital, indicating real-world deployment and testing \\cite{piccialli2021d0v}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**: While the paper states the system's goal is to \"raise the quality of sepsis treatment\" and \"ultimately improves patient care\" leading to \"fewer deaths\" \\cite{piccialli2021d0v}, the provided excerpt *does not contain specific quantitative experimental results* such as model accuracy, precision, recall, F1-scores, or measured reductions in mortality rates or length of stay. The validation described is primarily through successful operational integration rather than explicit performance metrics of the AI model itself.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The provided text does not detail specific technical limitations of the deep learning model (e.g., data biases, interpretability challenges). The main \"limitation\" addressed is the common oversight in AI development of neglecting the complex social and organizational factors crucial for real-world effectiveness.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The Sepsis Watch system is specifically implemented for sepsis detection and management within the Emergency Department of a hospital system \\cite{piccialli2021d0v}. The broader insights regarding sociotechnical systems and \"repair work\" are applicable to the deployment of AI in other complex, human-centric domains beyond healthcare.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   This work significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by demonstrating a successful, integrated deployment of a deep learning model for sepsis prediction in a live clinical environment, moving beyond theoretical models to practical application \\cite{piccialli2021d0v}.\n    *   It provides a crucial case study for future AI research, emphasizing that effective AI innovation requires a holistic \"sociotechnical\" approach that considers human factors, organizational context, and the \"repair work\" necessary for seamless integration, rather than solely focusing on algorithmic performance \\cite{piccialli2021d0v}. This can lead to more impactful and usable AI solutions in healthcare and other fields.",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) centred diagnostic systems are increasingly recognised as robust solutions in healthcare delivery pathways. In turn, there has been a concurrent rise in secondary research studies regarding these technologies in order to influence key clinical and policymaking decisions. It is therefore essential that these studies accurately appraise methodological quality and risk of bias within shortlisted trials and reports. In order to assess whether this critical step is performed, we undertook a meta-research study evaluating adherence to the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool within AI diagnostic accuracy systematic reviews. A literature search was conducted on all studies published from 2000 to December 2020. Of 50 included reviews, 36 performed the quality assessment, of which 27 utilised the QUADAS-2 tool. Bias was reported across all four domains of QUADAS-2. Two hundred forty-three of 423 studies (57.5%) across all systematic reviews utilising QUADAS-2 reported a high or unclear risk of bias in the patient selection domain, 110 (26%) reported a high or unclear risk of bias in the index test domain, 121 (28.6%) in the reference standard domain and 157 (37.1%) in the flow and timing domain. This study demonstrates the incomplete uptake of quality assessment tools in reviews of AI-based diagnostic accuracy studies and highlights inconsistent reporting across all domains of quality assessment. Poor standards of reporting act as barriers to clinical implementation. The creation of an AI-specific extension for quality assessment tools of diagnostic accuracy AI studies may facilitate the safe translation of AI tools into clinical practice.",

However, AI studies possess unique methodological characteristics, techniques, and analytical challenges that may not be adequately captured by existing quality assessment tools like QUADAS-2. A lack of rigorous quality appraisal in these reviews can lead to unreliable conclusions, hinder the safe translation of AI tools into practice, and foster skepticism among healthcare professionals.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches**: The QUADAS-2 tool is the most widely accepted guideline for methodological assessment in systematic reviews of diagnostic accuracy. Other tools like MINORS, Newcastle-Ottawa Score, Jadad Score, and the Radiomics Quality Score (RQS) are also mentioned.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: The applicability and suitability of QUADAS-2 for AI-specific studies were largely unknown and unexamined. AI studies differ significantly from conventional trials, suggesting that areas of potential bias and applicability concerns might also differ substantially, making generic tools potentially inadequate. No formal studies had systematically evaluated the adherence to and suitability of QUADAS-2 in this specific domain.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: This paper employs a *meta-research study* methodology. It systematically reviews and analyzes existing systematic reviews of AI-based diagnostic accuracy studies. The approach involved:\n        *   A comprehensive literature search (2000 to December 2020) to identify relevant systematic reviews.\n        *   Data extraction from these reviews to determine if quality assessment was performed, which tools were used (with a focus on QUADAS-2), and how risk of bias and applicability were reported across QUADAS-2 domains.\n        *   Quantitative analysis of the extracted data to identify patterns and deficiencies in quality assessment practices.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**: The innovation lies in applying a rigorous meta-research framework to critically evaluate the *methodological quality of secondary research* (systematic reviews) in the rapidly evolving field of AI diagnostics. This is not about developing a new AI algorithm, but about assessing the scientific rigor and reporting standards of the evidence base for AI diagnostics, which is crucial for responsible AI adoption in healthcare.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**:\n        *   Empirically demonstrates the \"incomplete uptake\" of quality assessment tools and \"inconsistent reporting\" across domains in systematic reviews of AI diagnostic accuracy studies \\cite{jayakumar2022sav}.\n        *   Quantifies the significant prevalence of high or unclear risk of bias in primary AI diagnostic studies, particularly in the \"patient selection\" domain (57.5% of studies) \\cite{jayakumar2022sav}.\n        *   Highlights that \"poor standards of reporting act as barriers to clinical implementation\" of AI tools \\cite{jayakumar2022sav}.\n        *   Proposes the critical need for an \"AI-specific extension for quality assessment tools of diagnostic accuracy AI studies\" to facilitate safe clinical translation \\cite{jayakumar2022sav}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: A systematic literature search was performed, yielding 135 papers, from which 50 systematic reviews of AI-based diagnostic accuracy studies were included for analysis. These 50 reviews collectively included 1110 primary studies. The analysis categorized reviews by AI application (axial imaging, non-axial imaging, photographic images, pathology, waveform data).\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   Of the 50 included systematic reviews, only 36 (75%) performed any form of quality assessment.\n        *   Of those 36, 27 (75%) utilized the QUADAS-2 tool.\n        *   Across all primary studies assessed by QUADAS-2 within these systematic reviews (n=423), a high or unclear risk of bias was reported in:\n            *   **Patient selection**: 57.5% of studies (243/423) \\cite{jayakumar2022sav}.\n            *   **Index test**: 26% of studies (110/423) \\cite{jayakumar2022sav}.\n            *   **Reference standard**: 28.6% of studies (121/423) \\cite{jayakumar2022sav}.\n            *   **Flow and timing**: 37.1% of studies (157/423) \\cite{jayakumar2022sav}.\n        *   Several systematic reviews reported modifying QUADAS-2 or using other tools, indicating perceived limitations of existing tools for AI studies.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The study's findings are dependent on the reporting quality of the systematic reviews analyzed; if those reviews did not transparently report their quality assessments, this meta-research would reflect that limitation. The study identifies a need for an AI-specific tool but does not propose or develop one.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The findings are directly applicable to the domain of AI-based diagnostic accuracy studies and the methodologies used in their systematic reviews. The analysis is based on literature published up to December 2020, so more recent trends are not captured.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advance State-of-the-Art**: This paper significantly advances the state-of-the-art by providing the first comprehensive meta-research evaluation of quality assessment practices in systematic reviews of AI diagnostic accuracy studies. It shifts the focus from merely applying AI to critically examining the methodological rigor of the evidence base supporting AI's clinical utility.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: The study provides compelling empirical evidence for the urgent need to develop and standardize AI-specific quality assessment tools and reporting guidelines. This will directly influence future methodological research in evidence synthesis for AI, leading to more robust and trustworthy systematic reviews, which are essential for building confidence among stakeholders and facilitating the safe and effective integration of AI into clinical practice.",

This study aimed to investigate the clinical impact and quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving interventions evaluating TS, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) prediction tools. A systematic review on PubMed was conducted to identify RCTs involving TS/ML/DL tool interventions in the past decade. A total of 65 RCTs from 26,082 records were included. A majority of them had model development studies and generally good performance was achieved. The function of TS and ML tools in the RCTs mainly included assistive treatment decisions, assistive diagnosis, and risk stratification, but DL trials were only conducted for assistive diagnosis. Nearly two-fifths of the trial interventions showed no clinical benefit compared to standard care. Though DL and ML interventions achieved higher rates of positive results than TS in the RCTs, in trials with low risk of bias (17/65) the advantage of DL to TS was reduced while the advantage of ML to TS disappeared. The current applications of DL were not yet fully spread performed in medicine. It is predictable that DL will integrate more complex clinical problems than ML and TS tools in the future. Therefore, rigorous studies are required before the clinical application of these tools.",

RCTs are the gold standard for establishing clinical efficacy, making a systematic review of these trials essential to understand the true utility and quality of these advanced tools in practice \\cite{zhou2021vqt}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** Previous reviews on AI interventions in digital health and medical decision support systems exist, but they often included a small number of studies, focused on specific fields, and lacked quantitative analysis of clinical impact and quality \\cite{zhou2021vqt}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:** The limited scope and quantitative depth of prior reviews left a gap in understanding the broader landscape of AI prediction tool interventions in RCTs, particularly across different AI paradigms (ML, DL) and in comparison to TS methods \\cite{zhou2021vqt}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method/Algorithm:** The paper employs a systematic review methodology, searching PubMed (up to Oct 2020) and clinical trial registries to identify RCTs evaluating TS, ML, and DL prediction tool interventions. It categorizes trials by tool type (TS, ML, DL) and assesses their clinical impact (positive/negative primary outcome) and methodological quality using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool \\cite{zhou2021vqt}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:** The innovation lies in its comprehensive and quantitative approach to systematically review a large number of RCTs (65 included) across TS, ML, and DL tools. It provides a detailed comparative analysis of their clinical effectiveness, methodological rigor, and reporting quality (e.g., CONSORT adherence), offering a broader and more granular understanding than previous, more limited reviews \\cite{zhou2021vqt}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Systematic Methodology:** Development and application of a rigorous systematic review protocol to identify, screen, and extract data from RCTs evaluating diverse prediction tools (TS, ML, DL) in clinical settings \\cite{zhou2021vqt}.\n    *   **Quantitative Comparative Analysis:** First comprehensive quantitative comparison of clinical impact (positive vs. no benefit) and methodological quality (risk of bias) across TS, ML, and DL interventions in RCTs \\cite{zhou2021vqt}.\n    *   **Quality Assessment Framework:** Application of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool to assess the methodological quality of included RCTs and analysis of reporting quality against CONSORT guidelines \\cite{zhou2021vqt}.\n    *   **Insights into Application Domains:** Characterization of the primary functions (assistive diagnosis, treatment decisions, risk stratification) and clinical domains where TS, ML, and DL tools are being applied in RCTs \\cite{zhou2021vqt}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** A systematic search of PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov was performed, yielding 26,082 records, from which 65 RCTs (published between 2010-2020) were included for detailed analysis \\cite{zhou2021vqt}. Data extraction covered publication details, tool type, target function, algorithms, input/output, controls, clinical domain, model performance in prior observational studies, primary outcome significance, sample size, duration, and reporting quality (CONSORT, ITT, blinding) \\cite{zhou2021vqt}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results:**\n        *   **Clinical Benefit:** 61.5% of trials showed positive results (statistically significant benefit), while 38.5% showed no clinical benefit compared to standard care \\cite{zhou2021vqt}.\n        *   **Tool Type Comparison:** DL and ML interventions achieved higher rates of positive results than TS overall. However, in trials with a low risk of bias (17/65), the advantage of DL over TS was reduced, and the advantage of ML over TS disappeared \\cite{zhou2021vqt}.\n        *   **Methodological Quality:** Only 26.2% of trials had an overall low risk of bias; 38.5% had some concerns, and 35.4% had a high risk. Blinding of participants/personnel and outcome assessment were frequent sources of high bias \\cite{zhou2021vqt}.\n        *   **Reporting Quality:** A significant majority (72.3%) of RCTs did not reference the CONSORT statement \\cite{zhou2021vqt}.\n        *   **Application:** DL tools were primarily used for assistive diagnosis, while TS and ML tools had broader applications including assistive treatment decisions, diagnosis, and risk stratification \\cite{zhou2021vqt}.\n        *   **Prior Validation:** 89% of RCTs had prior model development studies, but only two referenced TRIPOD guidance \\cite{zhou2021vqt}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The heterogeneity of the included trials prevented a meta-analysis of actual effect sizes, limiting the synthesis to statistical significance of primary outcomes \\cite{zhou2021vqt}. The review was limited to PubMed for published papers (though clinicaltrials.gov and reference lists were also checked) \\cite{zhou2021vqt}. The CONSORT-AI extension was not used for quality assessment as it was published after most included articles \\cite{zhou2021vqt}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The findings are applicable to RCTs evaluating TS, ML, and DL prediction tools in clinical settings published within the last decade (up to Oct 2020) \\cite{zhou2021vqt}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** This paper significantly advances the understanding of the clinical utility and quality of AI prediction tools by providing the most comprehensive quantitative systematic review of RCTs to date \\cite{zhou2021vqt}. It moves beyond observational performance metrics (e.g., AUC) to assess real-world clinical impact \\cite{zhou2021vqt}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:** The findings highlight a critical gap between the promising performance of AI tools in development studies and their demonstrated clinical benefit in rigorous RCTs, especially when accounting for methodological bias. This underscores the urgent need for more rigorous study designs, improved reporting standards (e.g., adherence to CONSORT-AI), and careful consideration of clinical endpoints in future research and development of AI prediction tools \\cite{zhou2021vqt}. It also suggests that the current applications of DL are not yet fully widespread in medicine, but are predicted to integrate more complex clinical problems in the future \\cite{zhou2021vqt}.",

        "abstract": "Background The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is an area of immense interest. The high profile of \u2018AI in health\u2019 means that there are unusually strong drivers to accelerate the introduction and implementation of innovative AI interventions, which may not be supported by the available evidence, and for which the usual systems of appraisal may not yet be sufficient. Main text We are beginning to see the emergence of randomised clinical trials evaluating AI interventions in real-world settings. It is imperative that these studies are conducted and reported to the highest standards to enable effective evaluation because they will potentially be a key part of the evidence that is used when deciding whether an AI intervention is sufficiently safe and effective to be approved and commissioned. Minimum reporting guidelines for clinical trial protocols and reports have been instrumental in improving the quality of clinical trials and promoting completeness and transparency of reporting for the evaluation of new health interventions. The current guidelines\u2014SPIRIT and CONSORT\u2014are suited to traditional health interventions but research has revealed that they do not adequately address potential sources of bias specific to AI systems. Examples of elements that require specific reporting include algorithm version and the procedure for acquiring input data. In response, the SPIRIT-AI and CONSORT-AI guidelines were developed by a multidisciplinary group of international experts using a consensus building methodological process. The extensions include a number of new items that should be reported in addition to the core items. Each item, where possible, was informed by challenges identified in existing studies of AI systems in health settings. Conclusion The SPIRIT-AI and CONSORT-AI guidelines provide the first international standards for clinical trials of AI systems. The guidelines are designed to ensure complete and transparent reporting of clinical trial protocols and reports involving AI interventions and have the potential to improve the quality of these clinical trials through improvements in their design and delivery. Their use will help to efficiently identify the safest and most effective AI interventions and commission them with confidence for the benefit of patients and the public.",

This lack of standardization can lead to issues such as inaccurate, unclear, irreproducible, or biased research articles, authorship disputes, undisclosed conflicts of interest, and scientific misconduct \\cite{ibrahim2021rcn}.\n    *   **Importance**: Ensuring public trust in the scientific process, maintaining the credibility of published articles, providing proper credit and accountability for research, upholding academic integrity, and facilitating the creation and dissemination of accurate, clear, and unbiased medical knowledge are paramount. The evolving landscape of research and technology (e.g., AI) presents continuous challenges to these goals \\cite{ibrahim2021rcn}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   This work is a comprehensive update and expansion of previous recommendations, formerly known as the \"Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals (URMs),\" first published in 1978 \\cite{ibrahim2021rcn}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Earlier versions primarily focused on manuscript preparation. The current document broadens its scope to address a wider array of ethical and practical issues that have emerged over time, including the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders (authors, reviewers, editors), scientific misconduct, and the impact of new technologies \\cite{ibrahim2021rcn}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Method**: The paper's core \"method\" is the formulation and periodic updating of a comprehensive, consensus-based set of guidelines and ethical standards for scholarly publishing. It adopts a prescriptive approach to improve the entire ecosystem of medical journal publication \\cite{ibrahim2021rcn}.\n    *   **Novelty**: The innovation lies in its continuous adaptation and expansion to address contemporary challenges. Key novel aspects include:\n        *   Detailed, four-criteria-based definition of authorship to ensure accountability and credit \\cite{ibrahim2021rcn}.\n        *   Specific guidance on the responsible use and disclosure of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted technologies in manuscript preparation \\cite{ibrahim2021rcn}.\n        *   A standardized Disclosure Form to facilitate transparent reporting of financial and non-financial relationships and activities for all participants in the publication process \\cite{ibrahim2021rcn}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**:\n        *   **Standardized Authorship Criteria**: A set of four explicit criteria that define who qualifies as an author, ensuring substantive intellectual contribution, critical review, final approval, and accountability for the work \\cite{ibrahim2021rcn}.\n        *   **Guidelines for AI-Assisted Technologies**: Clear directives on how to report the use of AI (e.g., in acknowledgments for writing, methods for data/figure generation), explicitly stating that AI cannot be an author, and emphasizing human responsibility for AI-generated content \\cite{ibrahim2021rcn}.\n        *   **ICMJE Disclosure Form**: A practical tool designed to standardize and simplify the disclosure of potential conflicts of interest for authors, reviewers, and editors \\cite{ibrahim2021rcn}.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: While not a software system, the recommendations provide an architectural framework for the *process* of scholarly publishing, defining roles, responsibilities, and interactions among authors, reviewers, and editors to ensure integrity and transparency \\cite{ibrahim2021rcn}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: The document provides a robust ethical and practical framework that underpins the theory of good scientific practice, transparent reporting, and responsible conduct in biomedical research and publication \\cite{ibrahim2021rcn}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   The paper itself is a set of guidelines and does not present traditional experimental validation (e.g., empirical studies, data analysis, performance metrics).\n    *   Its \"validation\" is derived from its widespread adoption and acceptance as a de facto standard by numerous medical journals globally, including ICMJE member journals and many non-member journals. The continuous updates reflect an iterative process of refinement based on real-world challenges and feedback from the scientific community \\cite{ibrahim2021rcn}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The effectiveness of these recommendations relies heavily on voluntary adoption by journals and adherence by authors, as the ICMJE \"has no authority to monitor or enforce it\" for non-member journals \\cite{ibrahim2021rcn}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: Primarily intended for medical and biomedical journals, although many of its principles regarding authorship, conflicts of interest, and ethical reporting are broadly applicable across scientific disciplines \\cite{ibrahim2021rcn}. The document also acknowledges that journal editors are not arbitrators of authorship conflicts, deferring this to institutions \\cite{ibrahim2021rcn}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: This document significantly advances the state-of-the-art in scholarly publishing practices and ethics by providing a globally recognized, comprehensive, and regularly updated benchmark for ethical conduct and transparent reporting in medical research \\cite{ibrahim2021rcn}. Its detailed guidance on emerging issues like AI use is particularly impactful.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: By promoting higher quality, more reliable, and ethically sound published research, the recommendations lay a stronger foundation for future scientific inquiry. They foster greater transparency (e.g., through data sharing recommendations for clinical trials and conflict disclosure), which can enhance trust, reproducibility, and collaboration within the scientific community. The specific guidance on AI sets a precedent for responsible integration of advanced technologies into scientific communication \\cite{ibrahim2021rcn}.",

The intrinsic ability to maintain genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of tumours allows for the reconciliation of shortcomings in traditional cancer models. While their utility in preclinical studies have been well established, little progress has been made in translational research and clinical trials. In this review, we identify the major bottlenecks preventing patient-derived tumour organoids (PDTOs) from being used in clinical setting. Unsuitable methods of tissue acquisition, disparities in establishment rates and a lengthy timeline are the limiting factors for use of PDTOs in clinical application. Potential strategies to overcome this include liquid biopsies via circulating tumour cells (CTCs), an automated organoid platform and optical metabolic imaging (OMI). These proposed solutions accelerate and optimize the workflow of a clinical organoid drug screening. As such, PDTOs have the potential for potential applications in clinical oncology to improve patient outcomes. If remarkable progress is made, cancer patients can finally benefit from this revolutionary technology.",

PDTOs offer a promising model for functional precision cancer medicine by retaining tumour heterogeneity and morphology, but their clinical utility is hampered by issues like unsuitable tissue acquisition methods, variable establishment rates, and lengthy timelines \\cite{foo2022wuj}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches**:\n        *   **2D Cell Cultures**: Widely used, easy, and low-cost, but inaccurate in replicating *in vivo* conditions, fail to recapitulate complex cancer biology (e.g., drug resistance), and exhibit altered cellular characteristics \\cite{foo2022wuj}.\n        *   **Patient-Derived Xenografts (PDXs)**: Accurately recapitulate human tumour biology but are extremely time-consuming, expensive, prone to murine-specific tumour evolution, and raise ethical concerns, making them unsuitable for high-throughput drug screening (HTS) \\cite{foo2022wuj}.\n        *   **Engineered Tumour Organoids**: Primarily used to understand carcinogenesis mechanisms, not for drug screening or clinical applications \\cite{foo2022wuj}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: The paper positions itself by highlighting that most existing reviews focus on the preclinical utility of organoids, neglecting the critical obstacles to their clinical translation and the practical challenges of applying them to real-life patients \\cite{foo2022wuj}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper is a review that analyzes the current state of PDTOs and proposes strategies to overcome their clinical translation bottlenecks. It focuses on PDTOs as 3D *in vitro* models derived from patient tissue (surgical resections, biopsies, or circulating tumour cells) that faithfully recapitulate the original tumour's genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity \\cite{foo2022wuj}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**: The paper's innovation lies in its comprehensive identification of the specific technical and logistical bottlenecks hindering PDTO clinical adoption and its proposal of integrated strategies to address them. These strategies include:\n        *   Utilizing **liquid biopsies via circulating tumour cells (CTCs)** for less invasive tissue acquisition.\n        *   Implementing **automated organoid platforms** to standardize and accelerate production.\n        *   Integrating **optical metabolic imaging (OMI)** for rapid and optimized drug screening workflows \\cite{foo2022wuj}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**:\n        *   Identifies and categorizes the major technical and practical bottlenecks for PDTO clinical translation, including tissue acquisition methods, establishment rates, lengthy timelines, limitations of the tumour microenvironment (TME) recapitulation, Matrigel dependency, scalability issues, lack of vascularization, and potential loss of heterogeneity \\cite{foo2022wuj}.\n        *   Proposes specific technical solutions (liquid biopsies, automated platforms, OMI) to accelerate and optimize the clinical organoid drug screening workflow \\cite{foo2022wuj}.\n        *   Analyzes the current landscape of clinical trials involving PDTOs, revealing a scarcity of trials focused on functional precision medicine and highlighting practical limitations in trial design (e.g., patient eligibility, therapeutic window) \\cite{foo2022wuj}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   As a review paper, it does not present novel experimental validation by the authors.\n    *   It references existing literature demonstrating that PDTOs can recapitulate the biological characteristics, histological complexity, and genetic heterogeneity of primary tumours, with varying success rates across different cancer types (e.g., pancreatic, colorectal, lung, breast cancer) \\cite{foo2022wuj}.\n    *   It reviews the status of clinical trials, noting that most are preclinical assessments, and only a small number (8 out of 76 identified) investigate PDTOs for functional precision medicine via drug sensitivity screening, with no published results yet \\cite{foo2022wuj}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations of PDTOs (as discussed in the paper)**:\n        *   Inability to fully recapitulate the complex tumour microenvironment (TME), including immune cells, fibroblasts, and vasculature \\cite{foo2022wuj}.\n        *   Reliance on Matrigel, an animal-based matrix with undefined components, which can affect reproducibility and limit drug penetration \\cite{foo2022wuj}.\n        *   Time-consuming and technically demanding generation process, requiring specialized personnel \\cite{foo2022wuj}.\n        *   Limited scalability and maximum size due to lack of vascularization, potentially leading to oxygen gradients and cell death in the core, and possibly missing drug-resistance mutations present in larger *in vivo* tumours \\cite{foo2022wuj}.\n        *   Risk of losing tumour heterogeneity with extensive passaging *in vitro* \\cite{foo2022wuj}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The review specifically focuses on the clinical translation of *patient-derived tumour organoids (PDTOs)* for *functional precision cancer medicine*, explicitly excluding engineered tumour organoids from its clinical application discussion \\cite{foo2022wuj}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advance State-of-the-Art**: This paper critically advances the technical state-of-the-art by shifting the focus from the *development* of organoid models to the *practical challenges and solutions* for their clinical implementation. It provides a structured analysis of the barriers preventing PDTOs from moving from preclinical research to patient benefit \\cite{foo2022wuj}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: It highlights crucial areas for future technical development, such as improving tissue acquisition methods (e.g., liquid biopsies), automating organoid culture, and developing rapid, non-invasive drug screening readouts (e.g., OMI). This review serves as a roadmap for researchers to address specific technical and logistical hurdles, ultimately aiming to enable personalized cancer treatment and improve patient outcomes through PDTO technology \\cite{foo2022wuj}.",

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n### Focused Summary for Literature Review: AI in Clinical Trials\n\n**1. Research Problem & Motivation**\n*   Clinical trials are characterized by significant inefficiency, high costs, and low success rates (only ~12% of drug development programs succeed) \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n*   A primary bottleneck is patient recruitment, which is often time-consuming and expensive; many trials fail to enroll sufficient participants \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n*   Other challenges include flawed study design, participant drop-outs, and inefficiencies in data entry, transfer, and ensuring correct medication dosage \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n*   The problem is critical because these inefficiencies delay medical advances and limit access to experimental treatments \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n\n**2. Related Work & Positioning**\n*   This paper positions Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), as a transformative solution to the inherent inefficiencies of traditional clinical trial methodologies \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n*   **Limitations of previous solutions (traditional methods):**\n    *   Manual patient identification from unstructured medical records is slow and resource-intensive \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n    *   Plain-text eligibility criteria require manual translation into coded database queries, hindering efficient patient database searches \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n    *   Public-facing trial information (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov) is often too technical for patients to understand, limiting self-matching \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n    *   Trial protocol design relies on human synthesis of vast, disparate information, leading to potential errors and delays \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n    *   Traditional methods for monitoring medication adherence are often unreliable, impacting study accuracy \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n\n**3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n*   **NLP for Patient Recruitment:** AI algorithms are trained to analyze unstructured medical text (e.g., doctors' notes, pathology reports) to identify patients matching complex eligibility criteria \\cite{woo2019njt}. This involves training algorithms to recognize synonyms and contextual nuances in free-flowing language \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n*   **Criteria2Query Tool:** An open-source web tool that uses NLP to translate plain-text inclusion/exclusion criteria into standardized, coded database query formats, enabling automated patient database searches \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n*   **DQueST Tool:** An open-source web tool that applies NLP to clinical trial descriptions (e.g., from ClinicalTrials.gov) to generate plain-English questions, helping patients self-assess their eligibility \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n*   **AI for Trial Design:** Platforms (e.g., Trials.ai) leverage NLP and other AI techniques to analyze extensive public and private datasets (journal papers, drug labels, clinical data) to guide the design of trial protocols. This allows for data-driven optimization of parameters like eligibility criteria to predict outcomes such as cost, length, and participant retention \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n*   **Computer Vision for Adherence Monitoring:** Systems (e.g., AiCure) use smartphone cameras and computer vision algorithms to record and analyze videos of participants taking medication, objectively confirming intake and potentially tracking responses via facial expressions \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n*   **Virtual Clinical Trials:** A theoretical approach where AI systems, with access to massive datasets like electronic health records, could simulate patient cohorts' responses to therapies, potentially replacing or augmenting real-world trials \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n\n**4. Key Technical Contributions**\n*   Development of NLP algorithms capable of interpreting complex, unstructured medical text for automated patient eligibility screening \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n*   Introduction of open-source NLP-driven tools (Criteria2Query, DQueST) that bridge the gap between human-readable trial criteria and machine-searchable formats, and between complex criteria and patient understanding \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n*   Pioneering AI-powered platforms for data-driven optimization of clinical trial protocols, moving beyond human intuition to predict trial outcomes based on design choices \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n*   Application of computer vision for objective, automated monitoring of medication adherence, enhancing data reliability in trials \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n*   Conceptualization of AI-driven virtual clinical trials, proposing a paradigm shift towards simulation-based drug development \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n\n**5. Experimental Validation**\n*   **Deep 6 AI:** Demonstrated significant acceleration in patient recruitment, finding 16 suitable participants in one hour compared to two in six months using conventional methods at Cedars-Sinai Smidt Heart Institute \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n*   **IBM Watson for Clinical Trial Matching:** A pilot study at Mayo Clinic reported an 80% increase in average monthly enrollment for breast cancer trials \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n*   **DQueST:** An initial evaluation showed the tool could filter out 60\u201380% of ineligible trials after 50 questions, with an accuracy exceeding 60% \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n*   **AiCure:** A study in schizophrenia patients indicated ~90% medication adherence with the platform, significantly higher than the ~72% observed with periodic human monitoring \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n*   **Trials.ai:** Is actively working to quantify the improvements its technology brings to trial designs, aiming to calculate time and cost savings for customers \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n\n**6. Limitations & Scope**\n*   **Technical Limitations:**\n    *   AI algorithms, particularly NLP, require extensive and time-consuming manual annotation of training data \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n    *   Current NLP engines are often specific to certain healthcare providers or diseases, lacking universal understanding across diverse medical fields and institutions due to variations in clinical text \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n*   **Scope of Applicability:**\n    *   Many AI applications in clinical trials are still in the \"theoretical realm\" and lack rigorous, large-scale validation studies \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n    *   Some argue that the complexity of AI-driven patient matching is not always necessary, as many trial eligibility criteria are relatively simple \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n    *   Significant challenges remain regarding patient privacy and the logistics of contacting individuals identified by AI tools \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n    *   A lack of a shared framework hinders standardized evaluation and comparison of different AI tools \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n    *   Virtual clinical trials are currently \"largely theoretical\" \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n\n**7. Technical Significance**\n*   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** AI significantly enhances the efficiency and speed of critical clinical trial processes, particularly patient recruitment and protocol design, which are major bottlenecks \\cite{woo2019njt}. It automates complex data analysis and decision-making tasks previously reliant on extensive human effort \\cite{woo2019njt}.\n*   **Potential Impact on Future Research:** AI could lead to faster medical breakthroughs, reduced drug development costs, and expanded access to experimental treatments \\cite{woo2019njt}. It has the potential to democratize access to trials by simplifying information and identifying more diverse participant cohorts \\cite{woo2019njt}. The long-term vision suggests a radical transformation, where AI-driven simulations and real-world evidence from electronic health records could potentially \"do away with clinical trials\" as we know them, representing a fundamental shift in medical research methodology \\cite{woo2019njt}.",

        "abstract": "Background Dental caries is one of the major oral health problems and is increasing rapidly among people of every age (children, men, and women). Deep learning, a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), is a growing field nowadays and is commonly used in dentistry. AI is a reliable platform to make dental care better, smoother, and time-saving for professionals. AI helps the dentistry professionals to fulfil demands of patients and to ensure quality treatment and better oral health care. AI can also help in predicting failures of clinical cases and gives reliable solutions. In this way, it helps in reducing morbidity ratio and increasing quality treatment of dental problem in population. Objectives The main objective of this study is to conduct a systematic review of studies concerning the association between dental caries and machine learning. The objective of this study is to design according to the PICO criteria. Materials and Methods A systematic search for randomized trials was conducted under the guidelines of PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). In this study, e-search was conducted from four databases including PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, and Google Scholar, and it involved studies from year 2008 to 2022. Result This study fetched a total of 133 articles, from which twelve are selected for this systematic review. We analyzed different types of machine learning algorithms from which deep learning is widely used with dental caries images dataset. Neural Network Backpropagation algorithm, one of the deep learning algorithms, gives a maximum accuracy of 99%. Conclusion In this systematic review, we concluded how deep learning has been applied to the images of teeth to diagnose the detection of dental caries with its three types (proximal, occlusal, and root caries). Considering our findings, further well-designed studies are needed to demonstrate the diagnosis of further types of dental caries that are based on progression (chronic, acute, and arrested), which tells us about the severity of caries, virginity of lesion, and extent of caries. Apart from dental caries, AI in the future will emerge as supreme technology to detect other diseases of oral region combinedly and comprehensively because AI will easily analyze big datasets that contain multiple records.",

        "abstract": "Background Accurately monitoring and collecting drug adherence data can allow for better understanding and interpretation of the outcomes of clinical trials. Most clinical trials use a combination of pill counts and self-reported data to measure drug adherence, despite the drawbacks of relying on these types of indirect measures. It is assumed that doses are taken, but the exact timing of these events is often incomplete and imprecise. Objective The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the use of a novel artificial intelligence (AI) platform (AiCure) on mobile devices for measuring medication adherence, compared with modified directly observed therapy (mDOT) in a substudy of a Phase 2 trial of the \u03b17 nicotinic receptor agonist (ABT-126) in subjects with schizophrenia. Methods AI platform generated adherence measures were compared with adherence inferred from drug concentration measurements. Results The mean cumulative pharmacokinetic adherence over 24 weeks was 89.7% (standard deviation [SD] 24.92) for subjects receiving ABT-126 who were monitored using the AI platform, compared with 71.9% (SD 39.81) for subjects receiving ABT-126 who were monitored by mDOT. The difference was 17.9% (95% CI -2 to 37.7; P=.08). Conclusions Using drug levels, this substudy demonstrates the potential of AI platforms to increase adherence, rapidly detect nonadherence, and predict future nonadherence. Subjects monitored using the AI platform demonstrated a percentage change in adherence of 25% over the mDOT group.

        "abstract": "As patient data are increasingly captured digitally, the opportunities to deploy artificial intelligence (AI), especially machine learning, are increasing rapidly. Machine learning is automated learning by computers using tools such as artificial neural networks to search data iteratively for optimal solutions.1 Typical applications include searching for novel patterns (eg, latent cancer subtypes2), making a diagnosis or outcome prediction (eg, diabetic retinopathy3), and optimizing treatment decisions (eg, fluid and vasopressor titration for septic shock4). Although many express excitement regarding the promise of AI, others express concern about adverse consequences, such as loss of physician and patient autonomy or unintended bias, and still others claim that the entire endeavor is largely hype, with virtually no data that actual patient outcomes have improved.5,6 One issue complicating this debate is that the classic measure of clinical benefit, the randomized clinical trial (RCT), is rare in this field, if not entirely absent. For example, the US Food and Drug Administration recently approved AI-enabled decision support tools (also called software as medical devices or SaMDs) for diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy on digital fundoscopy and early warning of stroke on computed tomography scans.7,8 In neither instance was approval based on any RCT evidence that the information provided by the SaMD improved care. Of course, diagnostic tools entered clinical practice for decades without the requirement for RCT data. However, these tools were traditionally framed as providing data, leaving judgment to physicians. In contrast, AI can provide data and judgment, thus altering clinician actions much more substantially.9 Against this backdrop, in this issue of JAMA, the report by Wijnberge et al10 of a clinical trial of an AI-derived clinical decision support tool provides important insight into the way RCTs might inform the debate on AI in health care. The study, somewhat ironically entitled the Hypotension Prediction During Surgery (HYPE) trial, randomized 68 patients who were undergoing elective noncardiac surgery to intraoperative management guided by an AI-based early warning system (intervention group) or standard care (control group). The primary objective was to test whether the intervention reduced the depth and duration of intraoperative hypotension (calculated as a time-weighted average). Both groups were managed with continuous radial artery pressure monitoring. In the intervention group, the arterial pressure was monitored by a SaMD that used 23 waveform variables, extracted continuously, to provide an updated prediction every 20 seconds of the likelihood of intraoperative hypotension (defined as mean arterial pressure <65 mm Hg) in the subsequent 15 minutes. The device issued an alarm when the risk exceeded 85% and encouraged the anesthesiologist to take preemptive action. The device displayed the risk score and a read-out of key variables (eg, stroke volume) used by the algorithm. The investigators also educated the anesthesiologists about the features of the device and provided a protocol to aid interpretation together with training on suggested actions to take (eg, intravenous fluid bolus or infusion of vasoactive agent) when the algorithm generated an alarm. In the control group, arterial wave data still flowed to the AI algorithm to allow it to run in silent mode, but only routine pulse and blood pressure data were displayed, as per standard care. The trial demonstrated that the intervention successfully reduced patients\u2019 exposure to hypotension, as evidenced by the primary outcome of a lower time-weighted average of intraoperative hypotension (0.1 vs 0.44 mm Hg; median difference, 0.38 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.14-0.43 mm Hg; P < .001), fewer episodes of hypotension per patient (3 vs 8 episodes per patient; median difference, 4 episodes; 95% CI, 1-7 episodes; P = 004), and fewer mean minutes with hypotension (8.0 vs 32.7 minutes; median difference, 16.7 minutes; 95% CI, 7.7-31 minutes; P < .001). Intraoperative management was also different between groups. The AI algorithm provided warnings frequently, including 377 alarms lasting longer than 1 minute (12 alarms per patient), and prompted anesthesiologists to initiate treatment within 2 minutes on 304 occasions (81%). Across several prespecified and post hoc analyses, anesthesiologists\u2019 behaviors differed between groups. Broadly speaking, anesthesiologists in the intervention group acted more often, acted sooner, and selected different treatments. There are several notable features about this trial. First, the problem the authors addressed is ideal for machine learning. Millions of patients require anesthesia every year, during which hypotension is both common and associated with adverse sequelae.11,12 High-fidelity continuous blood pressure monitoring is routinely collected but potentially underused because of the limits of human cognition. The algorithm, generated and published previously, was built from an automated search across arterial waveform data from more than 1000 patients, exploring the potential contribution of more than 3000 waveform features in more than 2.6 million feature combinations.13 The final model predicts the likelihood of future hypotension via measurement of multiple variables characterizing dynamic interactions between left ventricular contractility, preload, and afterload.

We tested the hypothesis that genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of CETP would preserve HDL levels and decrease mortality in clinical cohorts and animal models of sepsis. Methods: We examined the effect of a gain-of-function variant in CETP (rs1800777, p.Arg468Gln) and a genetic score for decreased CETP function on 28-day sepsis survival using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for age and sex in the UK Biobank (n=5,949), Identification of SNPs Predisposing to Altered Acute Lung Injury Risk (iSPAAR; n=882), Copenhagen General Population Study (n=2,068), Copenhagen City Heart Study (n=493), Early Infection (n=200), St. Paul's Intensive Care Unit 2 (n=203), and Vasopressin versus Norepinephrine Infusion in Patients with Septic Shock studies (n=632). We then studied the effect of the CETP inhibitor anacetrapib in adult, female APOE*3-Leiden mice with or with human CETP expression using the cecal-ligation and puncture model of sepsis. Results: A fixed-effect meta-analysis of all 7 cohorts found that the CETP gain-of-function variant was significantly associated with increased risk of acute sepsis mortality (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.44 [1.22-1.70], p<0.0001). In addition, a genetic score for decreased CETP function was associated with significantly decreased sepsis mortality in the UK Biobank (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.77 [0.59-1.00] per 1 mmol/L increase in HDL-C) and iSPAAR cohorts (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.60 [0.37-0.98] per 1 mmol/L increase HDL-C). APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice treated with anacetrapib had preserved levels of HDL-C and apolipoprotein-AI and increased survival relative to placebo treatment (70.6% vs 35.3%, Log-rank p=0.03), while there was no effect of anacetrapib on the survival of APOE*3-Leiden mice which do not express CETP (50.0% vs 42.9%, Log-rank p=0.87).

However, manual quantitation of PD-L1 positivity can be difficult and leads to substantial inter-observer variability. Although the development of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms may mitigate some of the challenges associated with manual assessment and improve the accuracy of PD-L1 expression scoring, use of AI-based approaches to oncology biomarker scoring and drug development has been sparse, primarily due to the lack of large-scale clinical validation studies across multiple cohorts and tumor types. We developed AI-powered algorithms to evaluate PD-L1 expression on tumor cells by IHC and compared it with manual IHC scoring in urothelial carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (prospectively determined during the phase II and III CheckMate clinical trials). 1,746 slides were retrospectively analyzed, the largest investigation of digital pathology algorithms on clinical trial datasets performed to date. AI-powered quantification of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells identified more PD-L1\u2013positive samples compared with manual scoring at cutoffs of \u22651% and \u22655% in most tumor types. Additionally, similar improvements in response and survival were observed in patients identified as PD-L1\u2013positive compared with PD-L1\u2013negative using both AI-powered and manual methods, while improved associations with survival were observed in patients with certain tumor types identified as PD-L1\u2013positive using AI-powered scoring only. Our study demonstrates the potential for implementation of digital pathology-based methods in future clinical practice to identify more patients who would benefit from treatment with immuno-oncology therapy compared with current guidelines using manual assessment.",

Although the development of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms may mitigate some of the challenges associated with manual assessment and improve the accuracy of PD-L1 expression scoring, use of AI-based approaches to oncology biomarker scoring and drug development has been sparse, primarily due to the lack of large-scale clinical validation studies across multiple cohorts and tumor types. We developed AI-powered algorithms to evaluate PD-L1 expression on tumor cells by IHC and compared it with manual IHC scoring in urothelial carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (prospectively determined during the phase II and III CheckMate clinical trials). 1,746 slides were retrospectively analyzed, the largest investigation of digital pathology algorithms on clinical trial datasets performed to date. AI-powered quantification of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells identified more PD-L1\u2013positive samples compared with manual scoring at cutoffs of \u22651% and \u22655% in most tumor types. Additionally, similar improvements in response and survival were observed in patients identified as PD-L1\u2013positive compared with PD-L1\u2013negative using both AI-powered and manual methods, while improved associations with survival were observed in patients with certain tumor types identified as PD-L1\u2013positive using AI-powered scoring only. Our study demonstrates the potential for implementation of digital pathology-based methods in future clinical practice to identify more patients who would benefit from treatment with immuno-oncology therapy compared with current guidelines using manual assessment.",

The problem is to extract this functional information from readily available structural data.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** Deep learning has been transformative in ophthalmology for disease classification and feature segmentation \\cite{lee2018ung}. However, these applications typically rely on expert-defined labels.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n        *   Existing AI models primarily focus on classification or segmentation, requiring extensive manual annotations \\cite{lee2018ung}.\n        *   Previous neural network applications for image translation in medicine (e.g., MRI to CT) have focused on translating between *structural* imaging modalities \\cite{lee2018ung}.\n        *   No prior work, to the authors' knowledge, has applied AI in ophthalmic imaging to generate a *new image based on a different imaging modality data* (specifically, functional flow from structural images) or bypassed expert annotations by using objective, functional measurements as ground truth \\cite{lee2018ung}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper proposes a deep learning model (a type of convolutional autoencoder network) trained to infer retinal blood flow maps directly from single structural OCT B-scan images.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:**\n        *   **Structure-to-Function Translation:** The core innovation is the ability of the AI to infer *functional* information (blood flow) from *structural* images, a significant departure from previous AI applications that translate between structural modalities or perform classification/segmentation \\cite{lee2018ung}.\n        *   **Objective Ground Truth Training:** The model is trained using OCTA images as the objective, expert-label-free ground truth, thereby circumventing the need for manual annotations and their associated limitations \\cite{lee2018ung}.\n        *   **Single B-scan Input:** The model processes individual 2D structural B-scans to infer corresponding flow B-scans, without explicit 3D knowledge of neighboring slices, which simplifies input requirements \\cite{lee2018ung}.\n        *   **Hypothesized Mechanism:** The authors hypothesize that the AI learns to decode subtle statistical properties of localized spatial speckle patterns (e.g., variance) within the static OCT images, which are known to correlate with dynamic blood flow \\cite{lee2018ung}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithm/Method:** Development and optimization of a deep learning architecture (a convolutional autoencoder variant with specific block depths, filter numbers, and copy+concatenation bridge connections) capable of translating structural OCT data into functional flow maps \\cite{lee2018ung}.\n    *   **Training Paradigm:** Introduction of a novel training paradigm in medical imaging where a more cumbersome/expensive functional imaging modality (OCTA) serves as the objective ground truth for training an AI to process a ubiquitous structural modality (OCT), entirely bypassing expert manual labeling \\cite{lee2018ung}.\n    *   **Inference of Subtle Information:** Demonstration that deep learning can infer subtle functional information (blood flow) from static structural images, likely by interpreting speckle patterns, which was validated by blurring input images \\cite{lee2018ung}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:**\n        *   **Model Architecture Search:** Four different model archetypes (varying block depth and convolutional filters) and three bridge connections (no bridge, element-wise summation, copy+concatenation) were tested to identify the optimal configuration (9 blocks, 18 convolutional filters, copy+concatenation bridges) based on Mean Squared Error (MSE) \\cite{lee2018ung}.\n        *   **Large-scale Training & Validation:** The best model was trained for 60,000 iterations on a large dataset of 401,098 structural OCT images (from 873 volumes) with corresponding OCTA images as ground truth. Validation was performed on 76,928 images from 171 independent cubes \\cite{lee2018ung}.\n        *   **Held-out Test Set Evaluation:** Performance was rigorously evaluated on a held-out test set of 92,606 images from 202 *different patients* \\cite{lee2018ung}.\n        *   **Comparison with Clinicians:** The model's output was compared against three masked, retina-trained expert clinicians in identifying vessels on structural B-scans, using OCTA as ground truth \\cite{lee2018ung}.\n        *   **Generalization to Pathology:** The model was tested on various retinal pathologies (diabetic ischemia, branch retinal vascular occlusion, cilioretinal artery occlusion) to assess its ability to generate flow maps in diseased states \\cite{lee2018ung}.\n        *   **Comparison with Other Modalities:** AI-generated flow maps were qualitatively and quantitatively compared to structural OCT en-face projections, color fundus photography, and fluorescein angiography (FA) for visualizing retinal vasculature \\cite{lee2018ung}.\n        *   **Cross-Device Generalization:** The model was tested on images from a different OCT imaging device \\cite{lee2018ung}.\n        *   **Mechanism Validation:** Blurred structural OCT inputs were used to demonstrate that the model relies on subtle features within the structural images, not just gross anatomical structures \\cite{lee2018ung}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Results:**\n        *   **Quantitative Performance:** Achieved a minimal validation MSE of 9.9482 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 and a test set MSE of 7.7665 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074, with a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 31.10 dB \\cite{lee2018ung}.\n        *   **Superiority over Clinicians:** The trained model significantly outperformed expert clinicians in terms of specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value when identifying vessels from single B-scans, using OCTA as ground truth (P < 0.00001) \\cite{lee2018ung}.\n        *   **Detailed Flow Maps:** The model generated detailed flow maps, identifying both large vessels and microvasculature, similar in fidelity to OCTA, and superior to structural OCT en-face projections, color fundus photography, and FA for superficial capillary networks \\cite{lee2018ung}.\n        *   **Pathology Generalization:** Successfully generated contiguous vessel maps in various pathologies, showing disrupted flow similar to OCTA in affected areas \\cite{lee2018ung}.\n        *   **Vessel Order Identification:** Identified significantly more third-order vessels compared to color images (p = 0.0320) and significantly more fourth-order vessels compared to both color and FA images (p = 1.86 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075 and 5.01 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 respectively) \\cite{lee2018ung}.\n        *   **Cross-Device Generalization:** Successfully predicted areas of non-perfusion in a patient with branch retinal vein occlusion using data from a different OCT device \\cite{lee2018ung}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations:**\n        *   While highly effective for superficial retinal vasculature, OCTA was still superior in showing deeper retinal vasculature and revealed a higher density of deep capillary plexus compared to the AI model's output \\cite{lee2018ung}.\n        *   The model processes single B-scans independently, without explicit 3D context, which might inherently limit its ability to fully capture complex 3D flow dynamics compared to true volumetric OCTA acquisitions \\cite{lee2018ung}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The model is currently demonstrated for generating retinal flow maps from macular spectral-domain OCT images. While it generalized to different pathologies and a different OCT device, its direct applicability to other body parts or different imaging modalities would require further research and adaptation \\cite{lee2018ung}.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** This work represents a significant technical advancement by demonstrating the first successful application of deep learning to infer *functional* imaging data from *structural* imaging data in ophthalmology, and potentially in medical imaging generally, without relying on expert manual annotations \\cite{lee2018ung}.\n    *   **Unlocking Historical Data:** The ability to generate flow maps from standard OCT images allows for the retrospective analysis of vast, pre-existing OCT databases, enabling studies on the natural history of vascular changes and clinical outcomes in retinal diseases that were previously impossible \\cite{lee2018ung}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:**\n        *   **Enhanced Diagnostics:** Could lead to more comprehensive diagnostic capabilities from standard OCT, making functional flow assessment more accessible and cost-effective \\cite{lee2018ung}.\n        *   **Improved OCTA:** The algorithms could potentially enhance the image quality of OCTA machines and reduce the number of frames required for acquisition, mitigating motion artifacts \\cite{lee2018ung}.\n        *   **Broader Medical Applications:** The principle of inferring functional information from structural images using objective ground truth could be extended to other medical fields (e.g., generating angiography-like images from CT or MRI), opening new avenues for AI in medical diagnostics and research \\cite{lee2018ung}.",

        "abstract": "Rationale Clinical decision support (CDS) tools leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) have been an approach for addressing challenges in asthma care but remain under-studied through clinical trials. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and efficiency of Asthma-Guidance and Prediction System (A-GPS), an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted CDS tool, in optimizing asthma management through a randomized clinical trial (RCT). Methods This was a single-center pragmatic RCT with a stratified randomization design conducted for one year in the primary care pediatric practice of the Mayo Clinic, MN. Children (<18 years) diagnosed with asthma receiving care at the study site were enrolled along with their 42 primary care providers. Study subjects were stratified into three strata (based on asthma severity, asthma care status, and asthma diagnosis) and were blinded to the assigned groups. Measurements Intervention was a quarterly A-GPS report to clinicians including relevant clinical information for asthma management from EHRs and machine learning-based prediction for risk of asthma exacerbation (AE). Primary endpoint was the occurrence of AE within 1 year and secondary outcomes included time required for clinicians to review EHRs for asthma management. Main results Out of 555 participants invited to the study, 184 consented for the study and were randomized (90 in intervention and 94 in control group). Median age of 184 participants was 8.5 years. While the proportion of children with AE in both groups decreased from the baseline (P = 0.042), there was no difference in AE frequency between the two groups (12% for the intervention group vs. 15% for the control group, Odds Ratio: 0.82; 95%CI 0.374\u20131.96; P = 0.626) during the study period. For the secondary end points, A-GPS intervention, however, significantly reduced time for reviewing EHRs for asthma management of each participant (median: 3.5 min, IQR: 2\u20135), compared to usual care without A-GPS (median: 11.3 min, IQR: 6.3\u201315); p<0.001). Mean health care costs with 95%CI of children during the trial (compared to before the trial) in the intervention group were lower than those in the control group (-$1,036 [-$2177, $44] for the intervention group vs. +$80 [-$841, $1000] for the control group), though there was no significant difference (p = 0.12). Among those who experienced the first AE during the study period (n = 25), those in the intervention group had timelier follow up by the clinical care team compared to those in the control group but no significant difference was found (HR = 1.93; 95% CI: 0.82\u20131.45, P = 0.10). There was no difference in the proportion of duration when patients had well-controlled asthma during the study period between the intervention and the control groups. Conclusions While A-GPS-based intervention showed similar reduction in AE events to usual care, it might reduce clinicians\u2019 burden for EHRs review resulting in efficient asthma management. A larger RCT is needed for further studying the findings. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02865967.",

Clinicians face challenges in extracting relevant information from the increasing volume of EHR data, leading to increased workload and limited time for patient care.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge:** Asthma is a prevalent chronic illness in children, requiring effective management. The existing EHR systems contribute to clinician burden and suboptimal care outcomes due to information overload and lack of timely, actionable insights. Developing AI-assisted Clinical Decision Support (CDS) tools is crucial to streamline information, reduce clinician workload, and improve the quality of care.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** The work builds upon the concept of AI applications in healthcare and CDS tools, which are recognized as potential solutions to address challenges in EHR utilization.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:** Existing EHRs are often inefficient and ineffective, contributing to clinician stress and increasing workload during limited clinical encounters (e.g., 15-30 minutes). While many AI algorithms have been developed, few have been rigorously tested in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for their impact on health outcomes. Some CDS tools have even been shown to increase costs and time for care.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method/Algorithm:** The paper introduces the Asthma/Medication and Prediction System (A/MPS), an AI-assisted CDS tool. A/MPS generates comprehensive reports for primary care providers (PCPs) by:\n        *   Summarizing relevant clinical information (e.g., care validity, risk factors, outcomes) for each asthma patient.\n        *   Providing machine learning (ML)-based predictive analytics for the risk of future asthma exacerbations (AE).\n        *   Suggesting asthma management options.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:**\n        *   **Integrated Data Mining:** A/MPS utilizes data mining tools, including Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms and ML algorithms (specifically, a Bayesian classifier), to process diverse data from EHRs. This includes preceding clinical encounters, patient-reported outcomes (e.g., Asthma Control Test scores), and non-clinical data (e.g., traffic volume, socioeconomic status).\n        *   **Predictive Analytics for AE Risk:** A key innovation is the ML-based prediction of AE risk within one year, derived from the past three years of EHR data, providing proactive insights.\n        *   **Actionable Management Options:** The system goes beyond mere information display by offering concrete asthma management options, aiming to directly support clinical decision-making.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods:**\n        *   Development and integration of NLP and Bayesian classifier ML algorithms to synthesize complex EHR data into actionable insights for asthma management.\n        *   A system design that combines clinical summaries, predictive analytics for AE risk, and suggested management options into a single, concise report for clinicians.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations:** A/MPS acts as an intermediary, processing raw EHR data and presenting a distilled, intelligent report to PCPs, thereby reducing the cognitive load and time required for manual EHR review.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** An exploratory pragmatic single-center Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) was conducted over one year. 147 consented participants (children <18 years with asthma) were randomized into an intervention group (receiving A/MPS reports) and a control group (receiving usual care without A/MPS reports). Stratified randomization was based on asthma severity, care, and diagnosis.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results:**\n        *   **Primary Endpoint (Effectiveness):** Occurrence of asthma exacerbation (AE) within one year.\n            *   **Result:** No significant difference in AE frequency between the intervention group (15%) and the control group (19%) (p=0.45).\n        *   **Secondary Endpoint (Efficiency):** Time required for EHR review for asthma management.\n            *   **Result:** A/MPS intervention significantly reduced the median time for EHR review per patient (6.9 minutes) compared to usual care without A/MPS (11.6 minutes) (p<0.001).\n        *   **Clinician Actions:** The A/MPS group showed a significantly higher number of proactive clinical actions/interventions (e.g., referrals to asthma programs, skin tests, spirometry, regular asthma-specific visits, ACT updates) compared to the control group.\n        *   **Asthma Control & Costs:** No significant difference was found in the proportion of patients with well-controlled asthma or in healthcare costs between the groups.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The study was a single-center trial, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. The AI model's performance is dependent on the quality and completeness of EHR data. The specific ML algorithm (Bayesian classifier) might have limitations compared to more complex deep learning models, though its interpretability can be an advantage in CDS.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The A/MPS tool was evaluated for childhood asthma management in a primary care setting. Its applicability to other conditions, age groups, or healthcare settings would require further validation.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** This paper demonstrates a practical application of AI-assisted CDS that significantly improves the *efficiency* of clinical workflows by reducing the time clinicians spend reviewing EHRs. While not directly improving primary clinical outcomes (AE frequency) in this trial, it shows that AI can reduce clinician burden without compromising care quality.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:** The findings highlight the potential of AI to streamline information processing in healthcare. Future research should focus on:\n        *   Conducting larger, multi-center RCTs to confirm these findings and assess generalizability.\n        *   Investigating how reduced clinician burden translates into improved patient outcomes over longer periods or in different contexts.\n        *   Refining AI algorithms to potentially achieve direct improvements in primary clinical endpoints while maintaining efficiency gains.\n        *   Exploring the impact of increased proactive interventions (as observed in the A/MPS group) on long-term patient health.",

With the advent of next-generation sequencers specifically, genome analysis technology has made remarkable progress, and there are active efforts to apply genome information to diagnosis and treatment. Generally, in the process of feeding back the results of next-generation sequencing analysis to patients, a molecular tumor board (MTB), consisting of experts in clinical oncology, genetic medicine, etc., is established to discuss the results. On the other hand, an MTB currently involves a large amount of work, with humans searching through vast databases and literature, selecting the best drug candidates, and manually confirming the status of available clinical trials. In addition, as personalized medicine advances, the burden on MTB members is expected to increase in the future. Under these circumstances, introducing cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) technology and information and communication technology to MTBs while reducing the burden on MTB members and building a platform that enables more accurate and personalized medical care would be of great benefit to patients. In this review, we introduced the latest status of elemental technologies that have potential for AI utilization in MTB, and discussed issues that may arise in the future as we progress with AI implementation.",

        "summary": "This paper, *Proposed Regulatory Framework for Modifications to Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML)-Based Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) - Discussion Paper and Request for Feedback* \\cite{hamamoto2022gcn}, is a discussion paper from the FDA proposing a regulatory framework, rather than presenting a novel technical algorithm or empirical validation of a system. Its \"technical\" contribution lies in analyzing the challenges posed by adaptive AI/ML technologies to existing regulatory paradigms and proposing a new approach to enable their safe and effective deployment.\n\nHere's a focused summary for literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the regulatory challenge posed by continuously learning and adaptive AI/ML-based Software as a Medical Device (SaMD). Traditional medical device regulations are designed for \"locked\" algorithms, where changes typically require premarket review. This paradigm hinders the ability of adaptive AI/ML SaMDs to continuously learn and improve post-market.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: AI/ML technologies offer significant potential to transform healthcare (e.g., earlier disease detection, accurate diagnosis, personalized medicine) by learning from real-world data and improving performance. The challenge is to establish a regulatory framework that allows these devices to evolve and improve rapidly while maintaining reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for patients.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches**: The paper references FDA's existing policies for SaMD, including guidance for software modifications (e.g., \"Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Software Change to an Existing Device\"). These policies require premarket submission for changes that significantly affect device performance, safety, effectiveness, intended use, or involve major algorithm changes.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: The traditional regulatory paradigm is not designed for the highly iterative, autonomous, and adaptive nature of continuously learning AI/ML SaMDs. Applying existing rules would necessitate frequent premarket submissions for algorithm changes, stifling the core benefit of continuous learning and real-world adaptation.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method/Algorithm**: The paper *does not propose a technical method or algorithm*. Instead, it proposes a *Total Product Lifecycle (TPLC) regulatory approach* for AI/ML-based SaMD modifications.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**: The innovation is a *regulatory paradigm shift* designed to accommodate adaptive AI/ML. This proposed framework aims to allow continuous learning and improvement post-market while ensuring patient safety. Key elements include:\n        *   Requiring manufacturers to define **pre-specified performance objectives**.\n        *   Establishing **defined algorithm change protocols**.\n        *   Implementing a **validation process** committed to improving performance, safety, and effectiveness.\n        *   Mandating **real-world monitoring** of performance.\n        *   Leveraging principles from the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF) risk categorization, FDA's benefit-risk framework, and the Digital Health Software Precertification (Pre-Cert) Program.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms, Methods, or Techniques**: The paper *does not present novel algorithms, methods, or techniques*.

        "abstract": "Background Patient\u2013ventilator asynchrony (PVA) is a common problem in patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) in the intensive care unit (ICU), and may accelerate lung injury and diaphragm mis-contraction. The impact of PVA on clinical outcomes has not been systematically evaluated. Effective interventions (except for closed-loop ventilation) for reducing PVA are not well established. Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the impact of PVA on clinical outcomes in patients undergoing MV (Part A) and the effectiveness of interventions for patients undergoing MV except for closed-loop ventilation (Part B). We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO-ICTRP until August 2020. In Part A, we defined asynchrony index (AI)\u2009\u2265\u200910 or ineffective triggering index (ITI)\u2009\u2265\u200910 as high PVA. We compared patients having high PVA with those having low PVA. Results Eight studies in Part A and eight trials in Part B fulfilled the eligibility criteria. In Part A, five studies were related to the AI and three studies were related to the ITI. High PVA may be associated with longer duration of mechanical ventilation (mean difference, 5.16 days; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.38 to 7.94; n \u2009=\u20098; certainty of evidence [CoE], low), higher ICU mortality (odds ratio [OR], 2.73; 95% CI 1.76 to 4.24; n \u2009=\u20096; CoE, low), and higher hospital mortality (OR, 1.94; 95% CI 1.14 to 3.30; n \u2009=\u20095; CoE, low). In Part B, interventions involving MV mode, tidal volume, and pressure-support level were associated with reduced PVA. Sedation protocol, sedation depth, and sedation with dexmedetomidine rather than propofol were also associated with reduced PVA. Conclusions PVA may be associated with longer MV duration, higher ICU mortality, and higher hospital mortality. Physicians may consider monitoring PVA and adjusting ventilator settings and sedatives to reduce PVA. Further studies with adjustment for confounding factors are warranted to determine the impact of PVA on clinical outcomes.

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper by \\cite{kyo2021ffp} for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Patient\u2013ventilator asynchrony (PVA) is a common issue in invasively mechanically ventilated ICU patients, but its precise impact on clinical outcomes (e.g., mortality, ventilation duration) is inconsistently reported across studies. Furthermore, effective interventions for reducing PVA, particularly those *other than* advanced closed-loop ventilation systems, are not well-established.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: PVA can lead to ventilator-induced lung injury and diaphragm injury, potentially worsening patient outcomes. The inconsistency in existing literature makes it challenging for clinicians to determine the necessity and optimal strategies for managing PVA. While closed-loop systems exist, they are not universally available, necessitating a clear understanding of more accessible interventions.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: The paper synthesizes existing observational studies and interventional trials. It acknowledges conflicting findings from previous individual studies regarding PVA's association with outcomes (e.g., some studies linked PVA to longer ventilation but not mortality, while others found increased mortality). It also recognizes that advanced closed-loop ventilation systems (like NAVA, PAV) can reduce PVA but are limited in availability.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: The primary limitation was the fragmented and often contradictory evidence from individual studies, preventing a clear consensus on PVA's clinical significance. There was also a lack of systematic evaluation of common, non-closed-loop interventions for PVA.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The study employed a systematic review and meta-analysis methodology, adhering to PRISMA guidelines. It was structured into two parts:\n        *   **Part A**: Investigated the impact of PVA on clinical outcomes, defining \"high PVA\" as an Asynchrony Index (AI) \u2265 10 or Ineffective Triggering Index (ITI) \u2265 10.\n        *   **Part B**: Assessed the effectiveness of interventions (excluding closed-loop ventilation) for reducing PVA.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**: This work provides a comprehensive, systematic synthesis of existing evidence, addressing the inconsistencies in prior literature. By conducting a meta-analysis, it offers a higher level of evidence than individual studies. The clear, pre-defined thresholds for \"high PVA\" (AI/ITI \u2265 10) allowed for standardized comparison across diverse studies.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**: The rigorous application of systematic review and meta-analysis techniques (e.g., random-effect models, conversion of medians/IQRs to means/SDs, GRADE approach for certainty of evidence) to a complex clinical problem with heterogeneous data.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: The structured two-part approach of first establishing the clinical impact of PVA and then evaluating interventions provides a logical framework for understanding and addressing the problem.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: Provides a consolidated, evidence-based understanding that PVA is indeed associated with adverse clinical outcomes and that specific, accessible interventions can reduce it, thereby informing clinical practice and future research directions.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: A meta-analysis was performed on 8 studies for Part A (PVA impact) and a qualitative synthesis of 8 trials for Part B (interventions).\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   **Part A (PVA Impact)**: High PVA (AI or ITI \u2265 10) was significantly associated with:\n            *   Longer duration of mechanical ventilation (mean difference, 5.16 days; 95% CI, 2.38 to 7.94; n = 8; certainty of evidence [CoE], low) \\cite{kyo2021ffp}.\n            *   Higher ICU mortality (odds ratio [OR], 2.73; 95% CI 1.76 to 4.24; n = 6; CoE, low) \\cite{kyo2021ffp}.\n            *   Higher hospital mortality (OR, 1.94; 95% CI 1.14 to 3.30; n = 5; CoE, low) \\cite{kyo2021ffp}.\n            *   Also suggested associations with higher incidence of reintubation and tracheostomy (CoE, low).\n        *   **Part B (Intervention Effectiveness)**: (Qualitative synthesis due to intervention variety)\n            *   **Ventilator Settings**: Adjustments in MV mode (e.g., PSV over pressure-control), higher tidal volume, and increased pressure-support level in PSV were associated with reduced PVA \\cite{kyo2021ffp}.\n            *   **Sedation**: Strategies like no sedation, wakefulness/light sedation (compared to deep sedation), and the use of dexmedetomidine (compared to propofol) were associated with reduced PVA \\cite{kyo2021ffp}.\n            *   One trial indicated that changing ventilator settings had a greater impact on reducing PVA than increasing sedation-analgesia \\cite{kyo2021ffp}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The certainty of evidence for many findings was low, primarily due to a lack of adjustment for confounding factors in the original studies included in the meta-analysis \\cite{kyo2021ffp}. Insufficient data prevented several planned subgroup and sensitivity analyses. The variety of interventions in Part B precluded a meta-analysis, leading to a qualitative summary.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The findings apply to adult patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The intervention analysis specifically excluded closed-loop ventilation systems.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advance State-of-the-Art**: This systematic review and meta-analysis provides the most comprehensive evidence to date, consolidating fragmented literature to demonstrate a significant association between PVA and adverse clinical outcomes (longer MV duration, higher mortality) \\cite{kyo2021ffp}. It also systematically identifies effective, non-closed-loop interventions for reducing PVA.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: The study highlights the critical need for future research to conduct well-designed studies that rigorously adjust for confounding factors to elevate the certainty of evidence regarding PVA's impact. It also encourages further investigation into the optimal application of identified interventions and their long-term effects. Clinically, it supports the practice of monitoring PVA and actively adjusting ventilator settings and sedatives to mitigate its occurrence \\cite{kyo2021ffp}.",

AI-PROBE encompasses a study design and a matching radiology IT infrastructure that randomly blinds radiologists for results provided by AI-based image analysis. To demonstrate the applicability of our evaluation framework, we present a first prospective randomized clinical trial on the effect of Intra-Cranial Hemorrhage (ICH) detection in emergent care head CT on radiology study Turn-Around Time (TAT). Here, we acquired 620 non-contrast head CT scans from inpatient and emergency room patients at a large academic hospital.

Cases identified positive for ICH by AI (ICH-AI+) were flagged in radiologists' reading worklists, where flagging was randomly switched off with probability 50%. TAT was measured as time difference between study completion and first clinically communicated reporting, with time stamps automatically retrieved from various IT systems. TATs for flagged cases (73+/-143 min) were significantly lower than TATs for non-flagged (132+/-193 min) cases (p<0.05, one-sided t-test), where 105 of 122 ICH-AI+ cases were true positive.

In establishing the gold standard, clinician interrater agreement was high (Cohen\u2019s kappa 0.70\u20131.00). On a per-patient basis, the performance of the trial matching system for eligibility was as follows: accuracy, 91.6%; recall (sensitivity), 83.3%; precision (positive predictive value), 76.5%; negative predictive value, 95.7%; and specificity, 93.8%. Discussion and Conclusion The AI-based clinical trial matching system allows efficient and reliable screening of cancer patients for clinical trials with 95.7% accuracy for exclusion and 91.6% accuracy for overall eligibility assessment; however, clinician input and oversight are still required. The automated system demonstrates promise as a clinical decision support tool to prescreen a large patient cohort to identify subjects suitable for further assessment.",

In a recent systematic review by Zhou et al., the authors surprisingly show that its impact so far has been quite limited. They reviewed 65 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating AI-based clinical interventions and found that there was no clinical benefit of using AI prediction tools compared to the standard of care in nearly 40% of studies. Among a subset of trials that the authors identified as having a low risk of bias, the clinical benefit of using deep learning (DL) predictive models over traditional statistical (TS) risk calculators was only minimal, and there was no benefit in using machine learning (ML) models over TS tools. Somewhat counterintuitively, most of the AI tools in these trials exhibited an excellent area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC; a common performance metric for predictive models) during development (median AUROC 0.81, IQR 0.75\u20130.90) and validation (median AUROC 0.83, IQR 0.79\u20130.97): a humbling reminder that robust predictive utility does not guarantee clinical impact at the bedside. As the science of building accurate predictive models progresses, our ability to translate these advancements into real-world clinical utility remains comparatively limited. How can we bridge this gap between AUROCs and clinical benefit?",

Early assessment of DILI risk is an essential part of drug development, but it is rendered challenging prior to clinical trials by the complex factors that give rise to liver damage. Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, particularly those building on machine learning, range from random forests to more recent techniques such as deep learning, and provide tools that can analyze chemical compounds and accurately predict some of their properties based purely on their structure. This article reviews existing AI approaches to predicting DILI and elaborates on the challenges that arise from the as yet limited availability of data.

(2021) \\cite{vall2021mrm}\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** The paper addresses the challenge of accurately predicting drug-induced liver injury (DILI) risk early in the drug development process using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches \\cite{vall2021mrm}.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge:** DILI is a significant cause of acute liver failure, leading to failed clinical trials and drug withdrawals. Its prediction is challenging due to complex underlying factors, the idiosyncratic nature of many DILI events (rare and difficult to predict), and the limited availability of high-quality, DILI-annotated data for training predictive models \\cite{vall2021mrm}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** This paper is a comprehensive review that synthesizes existing AI/ML approaches for DILI prediction, categorizing them by data modalities (chemical structure, gene expression, *in vitro* and imaging assays) and predictive models (rules/knowledge-based, shallow ML, deep learning) \\cite{vall2021mrm}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions (as identified by the review):**\n        *   **Data Scarcity:** A primary limitation across all approaches is the \"limited availability of data\" annotated with DILI risk labels \\cite{vall2021mrm}.\n        *   **Annotation Quality:** DILI annotations can be derived from diverse sources (clinical data, drug labels, registries) and vary in their level of detail and certainty.\n        *   **Underutilization of Advanced AI:** Despite the rise of deep learning, its application to DILI prediction, especially in combination with 2D or 3D imaging technologies, has been limited \\cite{vall2021mrm}.\n        *   **Reliance on QSAR:** Many methods rely on quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling using molecular descriptors, which may not fully capture complex biological interactions.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method/Algorithm:** As a review paper, it does not propose a novel method but rather surveys and categorizes existing ones. It discusses:\n        *   **Rules and Knowledge-Based Systems:** Simple decision rules based on *in vitro* assays, structural alerts, or physicochemical properties (e.g., \"rule-of-two\" for daily dose and lipophilicity) \\cite{vall2021mrm}.\n        *   **Shallow ML Methods:** Random forests, naive Bayes classifiers, decision forests, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, linear discriminant analysis, and probabilistic ordered logit models \\cite{vall2021mrm}.\n        *   **Deep Learning Methods:** Recursive neural networks (for molecular graphs), long short-term memory (LSTMs) for SMILES strings, graph convolutional neural networks, feed-forward neural networks, and deep neural networks for transcriptomic profiles \\cite{vall2021mrm}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference (of the review itself):** The paper's innovation lies in its systematic and structured overview of the diverse landscape of AI for DILI prediction, highlighting key datasets, data modalities, and ML techniques, and critically assessing their current state and future potential \\cite{vall2021mrm}. It explicitly points out gaps, such as the lack of deep learning applications to imaging data.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Comprehensive Review and Categorization:** Provides a structured overview of DILI annotation datasets (e.g., LiverTox, DILIrank, DILIst), data modalities (chemical structure, gene expression, *in vitro* and imaging assays), and the spectrum of AI/ML models applied to DILI prediction \\cite{vall2021mrm}.\n    *   **Identification of Research Gaps:** Highlights the significant challenge posed by limited data availability and the under-exploration of advanced deep learning techniques, particularly for processing complex imaging data from 2D/3D cell cultures \\cite{vall2021mrm}.\n    *   **Future Directions:** Emphasizes the promise of rich data modalities like 3D spheroids and the increasing availability of DILI risk labels as crucial for advancing the field \\cite{vall2021mrm}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   This paper is a review and does not present its own experimental validation.\n    *   It describes the validation strategies employed by the *reviewed* studies, which include:\n        *   Using independent datasets for testing (e.g., Ekins et al. (2010) testing naive Bayes classifiers on an additional dataset) \\cite{vall2021mrm}.\n        *   Employing cross-validation schemes (e.g., 5-fold, 10-fold) for model selection and performance evaluation (e.g., Zhu et al. (2014) with random forests, Chen et al. (2013b) with decision forests) \\cite{vall2021mrm}.\n        *   Optimizing ROC curves and using standard classification metrics to evaluate predictive power (e.g., Proctor et al. (2017), Garside et al. (2014)) \\cite{vall2021mrm}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations (of the field, as discussed):** The primary limitation is the \"limited availability of data\" for DILI prediction, which hinders the development of robust and generalizable AI models \\cite{vall2021mrm}. The complexity and multifactorial nature of DILI also pose inherent challenges.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The review focuses on *in silico* (computer-based) AI/ML approaches for DILI prediction, primarily leveraging chemical structure, gene expression profiles, and *in vitro* assay data \\cite{vall2021mrm}. It covers methods ranging from traditional QSAR to modern deep learning.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art:** The paper significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing a consolidated, critical overview of AI/ML methods for DILI prediction, serving as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners \\cite{vall2021mrm}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:** It clearly articulates the current challenges, particularly data scarcity and the underutilization of advanced deep learning with imaging data, thereby guiding future research directions. It highlights the potential of integrating richer data modalities (e.g., 3D spheroids) and the increasing availability of DILI labels to improve predictive models, ultimately contributing to safer drug development \\cite{vall2021mrm}.",

Uptake in medicine has been more limited, although in several fields there have been encouraging results showing excellent performance when AI is used to assist in a well\u2010defined medical task. Most of this work has been performed using retrospective data, and there have been few clinical trials published using prospective data. This review focuses on the potential uses of AI in the field of fetal cardiology. Ultrasound of the fetal heart is highly specific and sensitive in experienced hands, but despite this there is significant room for improvement in the rates of prenatal diagnosis of congenital heart disease in most countries. AI may be one way of improving this. Other potential applications in fetal cardiology include the provision of more accurate prognoses for individuals, and automatic quantification of various metrics including cardiac function. However, there are also ethical and governance concerns. These will need to be overcome before AI can be widely accepted in mainstream use.

        "summary": "There has been a recent explosion in the use of artificial intelligence (AI), which is now part of our everyday lives. Uptake in medicine has been more limited, although in several fields there have been encouraging results showing excellent performance when AI is used to assist in a well\u2010defined medical task. Most of this work has been performed using retrospective data, and there have been few clinical trials published using prospective data. This review focuses on the potential uses of AI in the field of fetal cardiology. Ultrasound of the fetal heart is highly specific and sensitive in experienced hands, but despite this there is significant room for improvement in the rates of prenatal diagnosis of congenital heart disease in most countries. AI may be one way of improving this. Other potential applications in fetal cardiology include the provision of more accurate prognoses for individuals, and automatic quantification of various metrics including cardiac function. However, there are also ethical and governance concerns. These will need to be overcome before AI can be widely accepted in mainstream use. It is likely that a familiarity of the uses, and pitfalls, of AI will soon be mandatory for many healthcare professionals working in fetal cardiology.",

VCTs are based on computer simulations of human anatomy, imaging modalities and image interpretation. OpenVCT is an open-source framework for conducting VCTs of medical imaging, with a particular focus on breast imaging. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the OpenVCT framework in two tasks involving digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). First, VCTs were used to perform a detailed comparison of virtual and clinical reading studies for the detection of lesions in digital mammography and DBT. Then, the framework was expanded to include mechanical imaging (MI) and was used to optimise the novel combination of simultaneous DBT and MI. The first experiments showed close agreement between the clinical and the virtual study, confirming that VCTs can predict changes in performance of DBT accurately. Work in simultaneous DBT and MI system has demonstrated that the system can be optimised in terms of the DBT image quality. We are currently working to expand the OpenVCT software to simulate MI acquisition more accurately and to include models of tumour growth. Based on our experience to date, we envision a future in which VCTs have an important role in medical imaging, including support for more imaging modalities, use with rare diseases and a role in training and testing artificial intelligence (AI) systems.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of infrequent periods (oligomenorrhoea) and absence of periods (amenorrhoea). It affects about 5% to 20% of women worldwide and often leads to anovulatory infertility. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are a class of drugs that were introduced for ovulation induction in 2001. Since about 2001 clinical trials have reached differing conclusions as to whether the AI, letrozole, is at least as effective as the first-line treatment clomiphene citrate (CC), a selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM).\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo evaluate the effectiveness and safety of AIs (letrozole) (with or without adjuncts) compared to SERMs (with or without adjuncts) for infertile women with anovulatory PCOS for ovulation induction followed by timed intercourse or intrauterine insemination.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched the following sources, from their inception to 4 November 2021, to identify relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs): the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO. We also checked reference lists of relevant trials, searched the trial registers and contacted experts in the field for any additional trials. We did not restrict the searches by language or publication status.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included all RCTs of AIs used alone or with other medical therapies for ovulation induction in women of reproductive age with anovulatory PCOS.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently selected trials, extracted the data and assessed risks of bias using RoB 1. We pooled trials where appropriate using a fixed-effect model to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for most outcomes, and risk differences (RDs) for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). The primary outcomes were live birth rate and OHSS rate. Secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy, miscarriage and multiple pregnancy rates. We assessed the certainty of the evidence for each comparison using GRADE methods.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nThis is a substantive update of a previous review; of six previously included trials, we excluded four from this update and moved two to 'awaiting classification' due to concerns about validity of trial data. We included five additional trials for this update that now includes a total of 41 RCTs (6522 women). The AI, letrozole, was used in all trials. Letrozole compared to SERMs with or without adjuncts followed by timed intercourse Live birth rates were higher with letrozole (with or without adjuncts) compared to SERMs followed by timed intercourse (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.11; I2 = 0%; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 10; 11 trials, 2060 participants; high-certainty evidence). This suggests that in women with a 20% chance of live birth using SERMs, the live birth rate in women using letrozole with or without adjuncts would be 27% to 35%.\u00a0There is high-certainty evidence that OHSS rates are similar with letrozole or SERMs (0.5% in both arms: risk difference (RD) -0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01; I2 = 0%; 10 trials, 1848 participants; high-certainty evidence). There is evidence for a higher pregnancy rate in favour of letrozole (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.45 to 1.98; I2 = 0%; NNTB = 10; 23 trials, 3321 participants; high-certainty evidence). This suggests that in women with a 24% chance of clinical pregnancy\u00a0using SERMs, the clinical pregnancy rate in women using letrozole with or without adjuncts would be 32%\u00a0to 39%.\u00a0There is little or no difference between treatment groups in the rate of miscarriage per pregnancy (25% with SERMs versus 24% with letrozole: OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.32; I2 = 0%; 15 trials, 736 participants; high-certainty evidence) and multiple pregnancy rate (2.2% with SERMs versus 1.6% with letrozole: OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.32; I2 = 0%; 14 trials, 2247 participants; high-certainty evidence). However, a funnel plot showed mild asymmetry, indicating that some trials in favour of SERMs might be missing.\u00a0 Letrozole compared to laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) One trial reported very low-certainty evidence that live birth rates may be higher with letrozole compared to LOD (OR 2.07, 95% CI 0.99 to 4.32; 1 trial, 141 participants; very low-certainty evidence). This suggests that in women with a 22% chance of live birth using LOD with or without adjuncts, the live birth rate in women using letrozole with or without adjuncts would be 24% to 47%. No trial reported OHSS rates. Due to the low-certainty evidence we are uncertain if letrozole improves pregnancy rates compared to LOD (OR 1.47, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.28; I\u00b2 = 0%; 3 trials, 367 participants; low-certainty evidence). This suggests that in women with a 29% chance of clinical pregnancy using LOD with or without adjuncts, the clinical pregnancy rate in women using letrozole with or without adjuncts would be 28% to 45%. There seems to be no evidence of a difference in miscarriage rates per pregnancy comparing letrozole to LOD (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.92; I\u00b2 = 0%; 3 trials, 122 participants; low-certainty evidence). This also applies to multiple pregnancies (OR 3.00, 95% CI 0.12 to 74.90; 1 trial, 141 participants; very low-certainty evidence).\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nLetrozole appears to improve live birth rates and pregnancy rates in infertile women with anovulatory PCOS, compared to SERMs, when used for ovulation induction, followed by intercourse. There is high-certainty evidence that OHSS rates are similar with letrozole or SERMs. There was high-certainty evidence of no difference in miscarriage rate and multiple pregnancy rate. We are uncertain if letrozole increases live birth rates compared to LOD. In this update, we added good quality trials and removed trials with concerns over data validity, thereby upgrading the certainty of the evidence base.",

This suggests that in women with a 22% chance of live birth using LOD with or without adjuncts, the live birth rate in women using letrozole with or without adjuncts would be 24% to 47%. No trial reported OHSS rates. Due to the low-certainty evidence we are uncertain if letrozole improves pregnancy rates compared to LOD (OR 1.47, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.28; I\u00b2 = 0%; 3 trials, 367 participants; low-certainty evidence). This suggests that in women with a 29% chance of clinical pregnancy using LOD with or without adjuncts, the clinical pregnancy rate in women using letrozole with or without adjuncts would be 28% to 45%. There seems to be no evidence of a difference in miscarriage rates per pregnancy comparing letrozole to LOD (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.92; I\u00b2 = 0%; 3 trials, 122 participants; low-certainty evidence). This also applies to multiple pregnancies (OR 3.00, 95% CI 0.12 to 74.90; 1 trial, 141 participants; very low-certainty evidence).\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nLetrozole appears to improve live birth rates and pregnancy rates in infertile women with anovulatory PCOS, compared to SERMs, when used for ovulation induction, followed by intercourse. There is high-certainty evidence that OHSS rates are similar with letrozole or SERMs. There was high-certainty evidence of no difference in miscarriage rate and multiple pregnancy rate. We are uncertain if letrozole increases live birth rates compared to LOD. In this update, we added good quality trials and removed trials with concerns over data validity, thereby upgrading the certainty of the evidence base.",

        "abstract": "Opinion statementIn the past decade, several endocrine treatment regimens have been developed for the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer, including tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors (AI), or a combination of these. The standard duration of adjuvant endocrine treatment has been 5\u00a0years for a long time. Nevertheless, the high number of recurrences occurring after 5\u00a0years suggested that extended endocrine therapy could further improve outcome, which led to the start of several randomized clinical trials investigating the effects of extended use of endocrine therapy. The extended duration of tamoxifen has been shown to improve disease-free survival and overall survival in the ATLAS and aTTom trials. However, in postmenopausal women, AIs have been shown to be more effective when compared with tamoxifen. Based hereon, it is recommended that adjuvant endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer should include an AI. Recently, the DATA, IDEAL, and NSABP B42 trials showed that extended adjuvant endocrine therapy with AIs beyond 5\u00a0years in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer did reduce the occurrence of secondary breast tumors, but had no or only a small impact on distant metastasis free survival. Furthermore, toxicity of adjuvant AIs led to gradually decreasing compliance rates and long-term toxicities to non-breast cancer-related deaths. Therefore, we suggest considering extended adjuvant treatment only in women with high-risk early breast cancer who tolerate treatment well.",

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical/research paper for a literature review:\n\n### Focused Summary for Literature Review: Current Status of Extended Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy in Early Stage Breast Cancer \\cite{hellemond201823h}\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** The paper addresses the high rate of breast cancer recurrences occurring *after* the standard 5-year duration of adjuvant endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge:** This problem is critical because late recurrences significantly impact long-term patient outcomes. The challenge lies in determining the optimal extended duration and regimen of endocrine therapy that can further improve survival and recurrence rates, while simultaneously managing treatment-related toxicities and ensuring patient compliance.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** The work builds upon the established 5-year adjuvant endocrine therapy regimens (tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors (AIs), or sequential tamoxifen/AI). It positions itself as a comprehensive review of randomized clinical trials that have investigated *extending* these therapies beyond the standard 5 years.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:** Previous 5-year regimens, while effective, still leave a substantial risk of late recurrence. Tamoxifen has known side effects (uterine cancer, thromboembolism), and AIs, while more effective, are associated with musculoskeletal events and bone loss, leading to compliance issues.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper employs a systematic review methodology, synthesizing evidence from published randomized clinical phase III trials (before December 2017) on the efficacy and tolerability of different extended adjuvant endocrine therapy regimens in postmenopausal women. The \"technical approach\" being evaluated is the *strategy of extending endocrine therapy duration* itself.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:** The paper's novelty lies in its focused synthesis of the evolving evidence base for extended therapy, providing a current overview of the benefits and drawbacks. It moves beyond simply comparing 5-year regimens to critically assessing the *value and feasibility of extending treatment*, particularly highlighting the nuanced benefits in specific patient subgroups and the practical challenges of compliance and toxicity.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Synthesis of Efficacy Data:** Provides a consolidated overview of hazard ratios for DFS, RFS, and OS from major trials (e.g., ATLAS, aTTom, MA.17, DATA, IDEAL, NSABP B42) investigating extended tamoxifen and AI regimens.\n    *   **Identification of Nuanced Benefits:** Highlights that while extended AI therapy beyond 5 years may have only a small or no overall impact on DFS/OS, it significantly reduces distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS), breast cancer-free interval (BCFI), and the incidence of contralateral breast cancer.\n    *   **Subgroup Analysis Insights:** Identifies potential patient subgroups (e.g., node-positive disease, larger tumor size, ER/PR expression, prior chemotherapy) that may derive greater benefit from extended AI therapy, suggesting a risk-adapted approach.\n    *   **Emphasis on Practical Challenges:** Systematically addresses the critical issues of decreasing compliance rates and long-term toxicities (e.g., musculoskeletal events, bone loss, non-breast cancer-related deaths) as major limiting factors for extended therapy.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted (Reviewed):** The paper reviews numerous randomized clinical phase III trials comparing standard 5-year therapy with extended durations (e.g., 10 years tamoxifen, 5 years AI after 5 years tamoxifen, 2.5 vs. 5 years extended AI).\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results:**\n        *   **Extended Tamoxifen (ATLAS, aTTom):** Demonstrated improved RFS and OS with 10 years vs. 5 years.\n        *   **Extended AI after Tamoxifen (MA.17, ABCSG-6a, NSABP B33):** Showed clear DFS benefit for 5 years AI after 5 years tamoxifen.\n        *   **Extended AI beyond 5 years (DATA, IDEAL, NSABP B42):**\n            *   DATA: No overall DFS benefit, but improved adapted DFS in high-risk subgroups (node-positive, larger tumors).\n            *   IDEAL: No statistically significant DFS/OS benefit for 5 vs. 2.5 years extended letrozole.\n            *   NSABP B42: No significant DFS/OS benefit, but statistically significant improvements in DRFS (HR 0.72) and BCFI (HR 0.71).\n            *   MA.17R: Trend towards improved 5-year DFS (p=0.06) and significant reduction in contralateral breast cancer (HR 0.42).\n        *   **Compliance:** Trials consistently showed decreasing compliance with longer treatment duration, with adverse events being the primary reason for discontinuation (e.g., 32% discontinuation for initial AI within 2 years due to adverse events).\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The paper's limitations are largely inherited from the reviewed trials, including the cautious interpretation of subgroup analyses (hypothesis-generating), potential biases from early unblinding in some studies, and the impact of high discontinuation rates on observed efficacy. The review focuses on published phase III trials, potentially excluding other relevant data.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The analysis is specifically applicable to postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer. It explicitly excludes studies concerning premenopausal women, locally advanced, and/or metastatic disease.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** \\cite{hellemond201823h} advances the technical state-of-the-art by consolidating the complex evidence for extended adjuvant endocrine therapy, moving clinical practice towards a more individualized, risk-stratified approach rather than a blanket recommendation. It highlights that the benefit of extended therapy is not uniform and must be weighed against toxicity and compliance.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:** The paper underscores the need for better patient selection tools (e.g., biomarkers) to identify those most likely to benefit from extended therapy. It also emphasizes the importance of research into strategies for managing side effects and improving long-term compliance to maximize the real-world effectiveness of extended endocrine regimens.",

Therefore, two different molecules targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 axis, namely everolimus and alpelisib, are available for patients progressing on/after previous AI treatment, but it is unclear how to optimize their use in the clinical practice. Here, we reviewed the available clinical evidence deriving from the BOLERO-2 and SOLAR-1 trials to compare efficacy and safety profiles of everolimus and alpelisib in advanced HR+ HER2\u2212 BC treatment. Adding either compound to standard endocrine therapy provided similar absolute and relative PFS advantage. In the SOLAR-1 trial, a 76% incidence of grade (G) 3 or 4 (G3/G4) adverse events was reported, while G3/G4 toxicities occurred in 42% of patients in the BOLERO-2 trial. While alpelisib was only effective in patients with PIK3CA-mutated neoplasms, retrospective analyses indicate that everolimus improves exemestane efficacy independently of PIK3CA mutational status. Based on the available efficacy and safety data, the \u201cnew\u201d alpelisib may be burdened by higher incidence of severe adverse events, higher costs, and anticancer efficacy that is limited to PIK3CA-mutated tumors when compared to the \u201cold\u201d everolimus. Therefore, the everolimus-exemestane combination remains an effective and reasonably well-tolerated therapeutic option for HR+ HER2\u2212 mBC patients progressing after/on previous AI treatment, independently of PIK3CA mutational status.",

However, the efficacy of ET could be limited by intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms, which has prompted the development of targeted agents and combination strategies. In recent years, the treatment landscape for HR+, HER2\u2212 MBC has evolved rapidly. AIs, historically the first-line treatment for postmenopausal patients with HR+, HER2\u2212 MBC, have been challenged by more effective ET, such as fulvestrant alone or in combination with an AI, and the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4/6 inhibitors, which have increasingly become the new standard of care.

The in-depth mining of clinical trial data enables us to grasp the application trend of artificial intelligence (AI) for cancer diagnosis. The aim of this study was to analyze the characteristics of registered trials on AI for cancer diagnosis. Methods: Clinical trials on AI for cancer diagnosis registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov database were searched and downloaded. Statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS 20.0 software. Results: A total of 97 registered trials were included. Of them, only 27 (27.8%) were interventional trials and 70 (72.1%) were observational trials. Fifteen (15.4%) trials had been completed. Fifty trials were in recruitment, and another 18 remained unrecruited. The number of cases included in the clinical trials tended to be large, 31 (32.0%) trials including samples ranging from 100 to 499 cases and 17 (17.5%) trials including samples ranging from 500 to 999 cases. Of the 27 interventional trials, only two trials reported trials' phase. Most (85.2%) interventional trials were for diagnosis, and a few (3.7%) were for the purpose of both the diagnosis and therapy of cancers. For the observational clinical trials, 46 (65.7%) were cohort studies, and 11 (15.7%) were case-only studies. Among the observational trials, 46 (65.7%) were prospective studies and 13 (18.6%) were retrospective studies. Among 97 trials, 37 (38.1%) involved colorectal cancer, 11 (11.3%) involved breast cancer, 43 (44.3%) were for imaging diagnosis, 33 (34.0%) were for endoscopic diagnosis, and 11 (11.3%) were for pathological diagnosis. For the interventional trials, 11 trials were parallel assignment (40.7%), and 14 were single group assignment (51.9%). Among the 27 interventional trials, 18 (66.7%) trials were performed without masking, 6 (22.2%) trials were performed with single masking, only 1 (3.7%) was performed with double masking, and 2 (7.4%) was performed with triple masking. Conclusion: It appears that most registered trials on AI for cancer diagnosis are observational design, and more trials are needed in this field.",

While AI applications in cancer diagnosis are rapidly emerging, there was no systematic analysis of how these technologies are being validated in clinical settings.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge:** Accurate cancer diagnosis is critical for patient outcomes, and AI holds significant promise in improving efficiency and accuracy across various diagnostic modalities (imaging, pathology, endoscopy). However, the absence of a \"gold standard\" for AI in cancer diagnosis necessitates rigorous clinical validation. Understanding the current state of these trials is crucial for identifying trends, gaps, and areas needing more robust research, especially given the rapid development and deployment of AI technologies.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** This work is a meta-analysis/cross-sectional study of existing clinical trials, rather than proposing a new AI algorithm. It positions itself by highlighting the increasing research into AI for cancer diagnosis \\cite{dong2020g8g} and the importance of clinical trials for validating diagnostic and treatment strategies.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:** The paper explicitly states that \"Up to now, there is no such study on AI for cancer diagnosis\" \\cite{dong2020g8g}, indicating a gap in the literature regarding a systematic overview and analysis of registered clinical trials in this specific domain. Previous work might have focused on individual AI applications or specific cancer types, but not a broad, cross-sectional analysis of the trial landscape itself.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method/Algorithm:** The core method is a systematic cross-sectional study of clinical trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov.\n        *   **Data Search:** Utilized a comprehensive search strategy on ClinicalTrials.gov (as of February 20, 2020, updated June 18, 2020) using keywords like \"artificial intelligence,\" \"deep learning,\" and \"machine learning\" to identify relevant trials.\n        *   **Data Screening and Extraction:** Two independent authors screened trials based on predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria (AI for cancer diagnosis, excluding purely therapeutic or incomplete registrations) and extracted detailed information (e.g., study type, status, sample size, sponsor, location, purpose, design elements like allocation and masking, cancer types, application methods).\n        *   **Statistical Analysis:** Descriptive analysis was performed using SPSS 20.0 software to characterize the included trials.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:** The novelty lies in providing the first comprehensive, cross-sectional analysis of the characteristics and trends of registered clinical trials for AI in cancer diagnosis. This systematic approach offers a unique overview of the research landscape, identifying common methodologies, prevalent cancer types, diagnostic modalities, and geographical distribution of these validation efforts.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Systematic Characterization:** Identified and analyzed 97 registered clinical trials on AI for cancer diagnosis, providing a detailed breakdown of their characteristics \\cite{dong2020g8g}.\n    *   **Dominance of Observational Designs:** Revealed that most trials (72.1%) are observational, with only 27.8% being interventional, suggesting a nascent stage of clinical validation for many AI diagnostic tools \\cite{dong2020g8g}.\n    *   **Emerging Field with Limited Results:** Demonstrated that the field is rapidly growing (58.8% of trials registered in 2019-2020), but most trials are still in recruitment (51.5%), and none had published available results at the time of the study \\cite{dong2020g8g}.\n    *   **Geographical and Sponsorship Trends:** Highlighted that nearly half of the trials (49.5%) are conducted in Asia, with universities (58.8%) and hospitals (30.9%) being the primary sponsors \\cite{dong2020g20}.\n    *   **Methodological Weaknesses in Interventional Trials:** Pointed out that a significant proportion of interventional trials (66.7%) were performed without masking, and many did not report allocation details or trial phases, indicating potential methodological limitations in early-stage validation efforts \\cite{dong2020g8g}.\n    *   **Focus Areas:** Identified colorectal cancer (38.1%), breast cancer (11.3%), and lung cancer (10.3%) as the most common tumor types, and imaging diagnosis (44.3%) and endoscopic diagnosis (34%) as the primary application methods \\cite{dong2020g8g}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** The \"experiment\" was the systematic search, screening, data extraction, and statistical analysis of clinical trial records from ClinicalTrials.gov.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results:**\n        *   **Trial Count:** 97 trials included from an initial search of 884.\n        *   **Study Type Distribution:** 72.1% observational, 27.8% interventional.\n        *   **Trial Status:** 51.5% recruiting, 15.4% completed, 0% with available results.\n        *   **Sample Size:** A tendency towards large sample sizes, with 32% including 100-499 cases, 17.5% with 500-999 cases, and 33% with >999 cases.\n        *   **Sponsor Type:** Universities (58.8%), Hospitals (30.9%), Industry (10.3%).\n        *   **Geographical Distribution:** Asia (49.5%), North America (34%), Europe (15.5%).\n        *   **Interventional Trial Design:** 85.2% for diagnosis; 66.7% without masking; 37% randomized, but 48.1% missing allocation details.\n        *   **Observational Trial Design:** 65.7% cohort studies; 65.7% prospective.\n        *   **Cancer Types:** Colorectal cancer (38.1%), Breast cancer (11.3%), Lung cancer (10.3%).\n        *   **Application Methods:** Imaging (44.3%), Endoscopy (34%), Pathology (11.3%).\n    *   The study did not compare AI performance against human experts or other AI models, as its focus was on the characteristics of the trials themselves.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:**\n        *   **Database Scope:** The analysis was limited to trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, acknowledging that not all studies are registered there (though it covers >80% of the WHO's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) \\cite{dong2020g8g}.\n        *   **Lack of Outcome Data:** Due to the short time span and ongoing nature of most trials, the study could not analyze the results or efficacy of the AI diagnostic tools, as most trials had not published outcomes \\cite{dong2020g8g}.\n        *   **Granularity of Analysis:** The broad scope across all cancer types meant that detailed, specific analyses for individual cancer types were not performed due to the limited number of trials for each specific type \\cite{dong2020g8g}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The findings are applicable to understanding the current state and trends of clinical validation for AI in cancer diagnosis as reflected in a major clinical trial registry. It provides insights into methodological rigor, geographical distribution, and focus areas, but does not evaluate the performance or clinical utility of specific AI systems.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** This paper provides the first systematic, quantitative overview of the clinical trial landscape for AI in cancer diagnosis. It moves beyond anecdotal evidence or reviews of individual AI applications to offer a macro-level understanding of how these technologies are being validated.

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the provided paper for a literature review, emphasizing technical aspects where applicable, and noting the absence of novel technical innovations or empirical validation as this is a review paper.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of \"AI Ethics in Smart Healthcare\" by Sudeep Pasricha \\cite{pasricha2022cld}**\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** The paper addresses the complex ethical challenges arising from the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into smart healthcare products, including medical electronic devices. These challenges span transparency, bias, privacy, safety, responsibility, justice, and autonomy.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge:**\n        *   AI is crucial for addressing global healthcare challenges (e.g., pandemics, universal access) by replicating or replacing human cognition, with AI solutions often surpassing human performance in areas like computer vision and natural language processing.\n        *   Despite AI's potential, its deployment in healthcare is fraught with risks: misuse (over-trust), disuse (under-trust), and abuse (disregard for patient/practitioner interests).\n        *   AI algorithms can exhibit unintentional biases from training data or operate as \"black boxes,\" making their decisions difficult to comprehend or explain.\n        *   Traditional medical ethics frameworks (e.g., principlism) are insufficient for AI development due to fundamental differences: lack of common goals/fiduciary duties, absence of a long professional history/norms, undeveloped methods to convert ethical principles into practice, and inadequate professional/legal accountability mechanisms for AI developers. This creates a trust deficit between patients and AI developers.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** The paper reviews foundational ethical theories (deontology, consequentialism, virtue ethics) and established clinical biomedical ethics principles (justice, respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence). It acknowledges the growing use of AI in other domains (automotive, robotics) also raises similar ethical concerns.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:** The core positioning is that traditional medical ethical frameworks, while robust for human-centric medicine, are inadequate for governing AI in healthcare. This inadequacy stems from four key differences:\n        1.  **Divergent Goals:** AI development is often profit-driven, contrasting with medicine's patient-centric fiduciary duties.\n        2.  **Lack of Professional Norms:** AI lacks the long-standing professional history, codes, and ethical culture that medicine possesses (e.g., Hippocratic oath).\n        3.  **Absence of Practical Mechanisms:** AI development lacks empirically proven methods (like ethics review committees, licensing) to translate high-level ethical principles into actionable practices.\n        4.  **Limited Accountability:** AI developers often lack the legal and professional accountability mechanisms present in medicine (e.g., malpractice law, professional boards), especially given outsourced development and diverse deployment contexts.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   This paper is a comprehensive review and analysis of ethical challenges, not a proposal of a novel technical method or algorithm.\n    *   **No core technical method or algorithm is presented.**\n    *   **No novel technical approach is introduced.** The paper's innovation lies in its systematic identification and detailed articulation of the ethical gaps and challenges specific to AI in healthcare, and its recommendations for integrating ethical principles into the AI product lifecycle.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **No novel algorithms, methods, or techniques are contributed.**\n    *   **No system design or architectural innovations are presented.**\n    *   **Theoretical Insights or Analysis:**\n        *   A detailed comparative analysis highlighting the fundamental disconnects between traditional medical ethics and the emerging ethical landscape of AI development.\n        *   Identification and in-depth discussion of seven critical ethical challenges exacerbated or newly introduced by AI in healthcare: transparency (e.g., \"black box\" algorithms, biased training data leading to misdiagnosis), responsibility (diffused accountability across complex AI development chains), bias (e.g., racial bias in risk assessment algorithms), privacy (e.g., large-scale data collection and insufficient legal protection), safety (e.g., AI misdiagnosis, challenges in regulating adaptive AI), autonomy (e.g., informed consent for AI-driven decisions), and justice (e.g., inequitable resource allocation by AI).\n        *   Outlining open challenges and providing high-level recommendations for integrating ethical principles across the entire lifecycle of AI-based smart healthcare products (design, validation, clinical trials, deployment, monitoring, repair, and retirement).\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **No experiments were conducted.**\n    *   **No key performance metrics or comparison results are presented.**\n    *   As a review and conceptual analysis paper, it does not involve empirical validation of a proposed technical solution. It uses real-world case studies and examples to illustrate the identified ethical challenges.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The paper does not propose a technical solution, so it does not have technical limitations in that sense. Its analysis is based on existing literature and observed trends in AI deployment.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The analysis is specifically focused on AI ethics within \"smart healthcare products, including medical electronic devices.\" The recommendations are broad and aim to influence the design, development, and deployment practices across the AI healthcare ecosystem.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** The paper significantly advances the understanding of the unique ethical landscape of AI in healthcare by providing a structured and comprehensive analysis of the challenges and the reasons why traditional ethical frameworks fall short. It serves as a foundational review for researchers and practitioners.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:**\n        *   It clearly articulates the urgent need for interdisciplinary research to develop concrete technical solutions for ethical AI in healthcare, such as:\n            *   **Explainable AI (XAI) techniques** to enhance transparency in \"black box\" medical AI.\n            *   **Bias detection and mitigation algorithms** to ensure fairness and prevent discriminatory outcomes.\n            *   **Privacy-preserving AI methods** for handling sensitive health data.\n            *   **Robust safety validation and regulation frameworks** for adaptive AI systems.\n            *   **Technical and procedural frameworks** for achieving informed consent in AI-driven medical decisions.\n            *   **AI design principles** that explicitly promote justice and equitable resource allocation.\n        *   It highlights the necessity for integrating ethical considerations into the technical curricula of AI developers and the clinical training of medical professionals, fostering a more ethically aware development and deployment ecosystem.",

Methods A combined analysis of two independent phase I clinical trials treating patients with HR+ MBC was performed. Patients treated with the combination of the CDK4/6i palbociclib+the\u2009ICI pembrolizumab+the aromatase inhibitor (AI) letrozole (palbo+pembro+AI) were compared with patients treated with pembrolizumab+AI (pembro+AI).

Results In the peripheral blood, higher pretreatment frequencies of effector memory CD45RA+ CD8+ T cells and effector memory CD4+ T cells were observed in responders to palbo+pembro+AI. In contrast, this was not observed in pembro+AI-treated patients. We further characterized T-cell subsets of effector-like killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily G member 1 (KLRG1+) ICOS+ CD4+ T cells and KLRG1+ CD45RA+ CD8+ T cells as baseline biomarkers of response. In comparison, pretreatment levels of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte, tumor mutation burden, tumor programmed death-ligand 1 expression, and overall immune composition did not associate with clinical responses. Over the course of treatment, significant shifts in myeloid cell composition and phenotype were observed in palbo+pembro+AI-treated patients, but not in those treated with pembro+AI. We identified increased fractions of type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) within circulating dendritic cells and decreased classical monocytes (cMO) within circulating monocytes only in patients treated with palbociclib. We also demonstrated that in palbociclib-treated patients, cDC1 and cMO displayed increased CD83 and human leukocyte antigen-DR isotype (HLA-DR) expression, respectively, suggesting increased maturation and antigen presentation capacity.

The objective of this paper is to identify current state of the art and application areas of AI in the context of participatory health. Methods: A search was conducted across seven databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsychInfo, ACM Digital Library, IEEExplore, and SCOPUS), covering articles published since 2013. Additionally, clinical trials involving AI in participatory health contexts registered at clinicaltrials.gov were collected and analyzed. Results: Twenty-two articles and 12 trials were selected for review. The most common application of AI in participatory health was the secondary analysis of social media data: self-reported data including patient experiences with healthcare facilities, reports of adverse drug reactions, safety and efficacy concerns about over-the-counter medications, and other perspectives on medications. Other application areas included determining which online forum threads required moderator assistance, identifying users who were likely to drop out from a forum, extracting terms used in an online forum to learn its vocabulary, highlighting contextual information that is missing from online questions and answers, and paraphrasing technical medical terms for consumers. Conclusions: While AI for supporting participatory health is still in its infancy, there are a number of important research priorities that should be considered for the advancement of the field.

The fast progress in this field poses the need to define new approaches and methods to support an agile and structured assessment process. The assessment of key information, characteristics and challenges deriving from the application of ML tools in CTs and their link with the principles for a trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) that directly affect the decision-making process is investigated. Potential issues are identified during the assessment and areas of greater interaction combining key regulatory points and principles for a trustworthy AI are highlighted. The most impacted areas are those related to technical robustness and safety of the ML tool, in relation to data used and the level of evidence generated. Additional areas of attention emerged, like the ones related to data and algorithm transparency. We evaluate the applicability of a new method to further support the assessment of medicinal products developed using data-driven tools in a CT setting. This is a first step and new paradigms should be adopted to support policy makers and regulatory decisions, capitalizing on technology advancements, considering stakeholders\u2019 feedback and still ensuring a regulatory framework on safety and efficacy.",

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the provided document for a literature review, interpreting the categories in the context of a strategic regulatory science paper rather than a traditional technical research paper:\n\n*   **CITATION**: \\cite{massella2022eix}\n\n### 1. Research Problem & Motivation\n\n*   **Specific technical problem**: The paper addresses the overarching challenge of how regulatory systems can keep pace with the accelerating pace of scientific and technological innovation in medicine development. This includes emerging areas like big data, precision medicine, advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs), novel manufacturing, novel clinical trial designs, and synthetic biology \\cite{massella2022eix}.\n*   **Importance and challenge**: This problem is critical because regulators must be ready to support increasingly complex medicines that converge different technologies to promote public health. The challenge lies in constantly adapting regulatory frameworks, acquiring necessary skills and expertise, generating new guidance, and fostering collaboration to facilitate the utilization and translation of these innovations into patient access \\cite{massella2022eix}.\n\n### 2. Related Work & Positioning\n\n*   **Relation to existing approaches**: This document is a strategic reflection that builds upon the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) extensive and ongoing work in regulatory science, including its previous roadmaps (e.g., \"EMA\u2019s road map to 2015\") and developing horizon-scanning capabilities. It represents an evolution and forward-looking update to the EMA's approach to scientific engagement \\cite{massella2022eix}.\n*   **Limitations of previous solutions**: The paper implicitly suggests that existing regulatory capacities and scientific engagement need proactive updating to address new challenges (e.g., post-Brexit landscape, implementation of new veterinary medicine regulations) and to fully leverage scientific and technological advancements that were not as mature or prevalent in previous strategic cycles \\cite{massella2022eix}.\n\n### 3. Technical Approach & Innovation\n\n*   **Core technical method or algorithm**: This paper does not present a specific technical method or algorithm. Instead, it outlines a *strategic framework* for advancing regulatory science.\n*   **Novelty or difference**: The \"approach\" is a comprehensive, stakeholder-driven strategic planning process. Its novelty lies in systematically identifying and prioritizing key areas for regulatory science engagement through extensive consultation (public consultation, workshops, expert input) to ensure the regulatory system can proactively support and integrate cutting-edge scientific and technological advancements in medicine development \\cite{massella2022eix}.\n\n### 4. Key Technical Contributions\n\n*   **Novel algorithms, methods, or techniques**: The paper does not present novel algorithms or techniques. However, it *identifies and prioritizes* areas where such innovations are needed within regulatory science, including:\n    *   Support for developments in precision medicine, biomarkers, and 'omics \\cite{massella2022eix}.\n    *   Facilitating the implementation of novel manufacturing technologies \\cite{massella2022eix}.\n    *   Developing the regulatory framework for emerging clinical data generation, including the exploitation of digital technology and artificial intelligence in decision-making \\cite{massella2022eix}.\n    *   Optimizing capabilities in modelling, simulation, and extrapolation \\cite{massella2022eix}.\n*   **System design or architectural innovations**: The paper proposes *goals* for future system evolution rather than presenting a detailed design. Examples include creating an \"integrated evaluation pathway for the assessment of medical devices, in vitro diagnostics and borderline products\" and developing network competence and specialist collaborations to engage with big data \\cite{massella2022eix}.\n*   **Theoretical insights or analysis**: The paper provides a strategic analysis of the future landscape of regulatory science, identifying critical trends and interdependencies between scientific innovation, regulatory frameworks, and public health outcomes. It articulates a vision for how regulatory science must evolve to remain effective and relevant \\cite{massella2022eix}.\n\n### 5. Experimental Validation\n\n*   **Experiments conducted**: No technical experiments were conducted. The \"validation\" process involved extensive stakeholder consultation, including a 6-month public consultation and workshops, to gather feedback and prioritize the proposed strategic goals and core recommendations \\cite{massella2022eix}.\n*   **Key performance metrics and comparison results**: The \"results\" are the prioritized lists of core recommendations for human and veterinary medicines, based on stakeholder input (e.g., Figures 3-6). This demonstrates consensus and perceived impact of the proposed strategic directions, rather than empirical performance of a technical solution \\cite{massella2022eix}.\n\n### 6. Limitations & Scope\n\n*   **Technical limitations or assumptions**: As a strategic plan, its inherent limitations include the challenge of accurately predicting all future scientific advancements and the practical constraints of \"necessarily limited network resources\" for implementation. It assumes continued collaboration and engagement from diverse stakeholders \\cite{massella2022eix}.\n*   **Scope of applicability**: The strategy applies to the European regulatory system for human and veterinary medicines (the EU network/EMRN) for the period up to 2025, with a focus on advancing regulatory science within this context \\cite{massella2022eix}.\n\n### 7. Technical Significance\n\n*   **Advancement of state-of-the-art**: This paper does not directly advance the *technical* state-of-the-art in a specific domain. Instead, it significantly advances the *strategic planning and direction* for regulatory science by proactively identifying and prioritizing key areas where regulatory frameworks, tools, and expertise must evolve to support and integrate cutting-edge scientific and technological innovations in medicine development \\cite{massella2022eix}.\n*   **Potential impact on future research**: The strategy outlines a clear agenda for future research and development in regulatory science and medicine. It highlights critical areas such as precision medicine, advanced therapies, real-world data, AI in healthcare, novel manufacturing, and innovative clinical trial designs, thereby influencing research priorities, funding, and collaborative efforts across academia, industry, and regulatory bodies \\cite{massella2022eix}.",

        "abstract": "Background Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are statistically characterized within randomized clinical trials and postmarketing pharmacovigilance, but their molecular mechanism remains unknown in most cases. This is true even for hepatic or skin toxicities, which are classically monitored during drug design. Aside from clinical trials, many elements of knowledge about drug ingredients are available in open-access knowledge graphs, such as their properties, interactions, or involvements in pathways. In addition, drug classifications that label drugs as either causative or not for several ADRs, have been established. Methods We propose in this paper to mine knowledge graphs for identifying biomolecular features that may enable automatically reproducing expert classifications that distinguish drugs causative or not for a given type of ADR. In an Explainable AI perspective, we explore simple classification techniques such as Decision Trees and Classification Rules because they provide human-readable models, which explain the classification itself, but may also provide elements of explanation for molecular mechanisms behind ADRs. In summary, (1) we mine a knowledge graph for features; (2) we train classifiers at distinguishing, on the basis of extracted features, drugs associated or not with two commonly monitored ADRs: drug-induced liver injuries (DILI) and severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR); (3) we isolate features that are both efficient in reproducing expert classifications and interpretable by experts (i.e., Gene Ontology terms, drug targets, or pathway names); and (4) we manually evaluate in a mini-study how they may be explanatory. Results Extracted features reproduce with a good fidelity classifications of drugs causative or not for DILI and SCAR (Accuracy\u00a0=\u00a0 0 .74 and 0 .81 , respectively). Experts fully agreed that 7 3 % and 3 8 % of the most discriminative features are possibly explanatory for DILI and SCAR, respectively; and partially agreed (2/3) for 9 0 % and 7 7 % of them. Conclusion Knowledge graphs provide sufficiently diverse features to enable simple and explainable models to distinguish between drugs that are causative or not for ADRs. In addition to explaining classifications, most discriminative features appear to be good candidates for investigating ADR mechanisms further.",

To gain adoption by the health care community, we plan to validate our results in a clinical trial and three other venues in Mexico, Spain and the USA . However, if we had data from other on-going clinical trials and volunteers, we may do much more. For example, for confirmed stay-at-home COVID-19 patients, a longitudinal audio test could be developed to determine contact-with-hospital recommendations, and for the most critical COVID-19 patients a success ratio forecast test, including patient clinical data, to prioritize ICU allocation. As a challenge to the engineering community and in the context of our clinical trial, the authors suggest distributing cough recordings daily, hoping other trials and crowdsourcing users will contribute more data. Previous approaches to complex AI tasks have either used a static dataset or were private efforts led by large corporations. All existing COVID-19 trials published also follow this paradigm. Instead, we suggest a novel open collective approach to large-scale real-time health care AI. We will be posting updates at this https URL. Our personal view is that our approach is the right one for large scale pandemics, and therefore is here to stay - will you join?",

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   The paper addresses the critical need for a scalable, rapid, and reliable pre-screening test for COVID-19 \\cite{subirana2020y2f}.\n    *   Existing diagnostic tests are often not available at scale, require significant healthcare professional time, are lengthy, and lack a reliable pre-screening mechanism, hindering early detection and disease containment \\cite{subirana2020y2f}.\n    *   The motivation stems from previous research demonstrating AI's potential for superhuman diagnostic capabilities from speech and audio, even with limited data, in conditions like psychosis, cognitive impairment, and pneumonia \\cite{subirana2020y2f}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   The work builds upon existing speech recognition algorithms for cough detection and machine learning applications for disease diagnosis from free-flow speech \\cite{subirana2020y2f}.\n    *   It leverages deep learning techniques, specifically transfer learning (e.g., VGG16, ResNet, EfficientNet), which have proven useful in low-resource and unsupervised scenarios \\cite{subirana2020y2f}.\n    *   The paper positions itself against prevalent AI approaches that rely on continuous data pipelines (like those of large tech companies) or static datasets, which are ill-suited for the rapid, evolving nature of pandemics \\cite{subirana2020y2f}. It critiques the paradigm of existing COVID-19 trials that follow this static approach.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   The core technical method involves using Artificial Intelligence transfer learning algorithms trained on phone-recorded cough sounds to develop diagnostic tests for COVID-19 \\cite{subirana2020y2f}.\n    *   The approach utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) initially trained on a regular speech dataset, followed by heterogeneous transfer learning to adapt it for COVID-infected cough audio recordings \\cite{subirana2020y2f}.\n    *   Specifically, it employs \"off-the-shelf\" feature generation, where pre-trained deep learning models (DenseNet201 and ResNet50) from the speech domain are used to extract features from a small target dataset of COVID-19 and healthy cough recordings \\cite{subirana2020y2f}. These features are then classified using shallow machine learning algorithms (SVM, k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Logistic Regression).\n    *   A significant innovation is the proposal of \"Sigma,\" a novel open, collective, and real-time approach to large-scale healthcare AI for pandemics, where both data (de-identified patient samples) and code (algorithms, models) are shared daily worldwide to maximize collaboration and rapid iteration \\cite{subirana2020y2f}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Method:** Demonstrates the application of heterogeneous transfer learning with \"off-the-shelf\" feature extraction from deep neural networks (DenseNet201, ResNet50) for COVID-19 diagnosis from cough audio, particularly effective in low-data environments \\cite{subirana2020y2f}.\n    *   **System Design:** Introduces the \"Sigma\" framework, an architectural innovation for pandemic response that facilitates real-time, open-source collaboration between medical and engineering communities for AI development \\cite{subirana2020y2f}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insight:** Formalizes the transfer learning problem in the context of COVID-19 cough diagnosis, defining the source and target domains and the need for domain adaptation to bridge differences in marginal distributions \\cite{subirana2020y2f}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   Experiments involved evaluating four shallow machine learning classifiers (SVM, k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) on features extracted by pre-trained DenseNet201 and ResNet50 models \\cite{subirana2020y2f}.\n    *   The models were tested on a small dataset of COVID-19 diagnosed and healthy patient cough recordings, split into 70% training and 30% testing \\cite{subirana2020y2f}.\n    *   Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to visualize the clustering and discrimination between healthy and COVID-19 coughs based on the extracted features \\cite{subirana2020y2f}.\n    *   **Key Results:** The approach successfully demonstrated the ability to \"automatically discriminate COVID-19 coughs from healthy coughs on a small dataset of under 200 samples\" \\cite{subirana2020y2f}. Visualizations (Figures 3 and 4) illustrate clear separation and even longitudinal changes in cough characteristics for individuals.\n    *   Future validation plans include clinical trials in Mexico, Spain, and the USA, targeting 3040 participants, and concurrent data collection efforts to grow and validate the model \\cite{subirana2020y2f}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations:** The initial validation was performed on a small dataset (under 200 samples), which may limit generalizability \\cite{subirana2020y2f}. The model's applicability might be biased towards specific languages or only the onset of the disease \\cite{subirana2020y2f}. The importance of various collected metadata is yet to be fully determined.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** Primarily focused on pre-screening for COVID-19. However, the authors propose extending the approach to develop longitudinal audio tests for stay-at-home patients and success ratio forecasts for ICU allocation \\cite{subirana2020y2f}. The \"Sigma\" framework is intended as a template for rapid AI response to future large-scale pandemics.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art:** This work significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by demonstrating the viability of rapid, non-invasive COVID-19 pre-screening using AI transfer learning on readily available phone-recorded cough sounds, even with limited initial data \\cite{subirana2020y2f}.\n    *   **Potential Impact:** The proposed \"Sigma\" framework offers a transformative paradigm for AI development during health crises, fostering unprecedented real-time, open, and collective collaboration between medical and engineering fields \\cite{subirana2020y2f}. This could lead to faster development of diagnostic tools, improved operational efficiency in healthcare (e.g., ICU allocation), and provide valuable training resources for healthcare professionals globally, ultimately mitigating the impact of future pandemics \\cite{subirana2020y2f}.",

Experimental Design: Matched case\u2013control studies [247 matched sets from MA.27 (anastrozole vs. exemestane) and PreFace (letrozole) trials] were undertaken to assess whether estrone (E1) or estradiol (E2) concentrations after 6 months of adjuvant therapy were associated with risk of an early breast cancer event (EBCE). Preclinical laboratory studies included luciferase activity, cell proliferation, radio-labeled ligand estrogen receptor binding, surface plasmon resonance ligand receptor binding, and nuclear magnetic resonance assays. Results: Women with E1 \u22651.3 pg/mL and E2 \u22650.5 pg/mL after 6 months of AI treatment had a 2.2-fold increase in risk (P = 0.0005) of an EBCE, and in the anastrozole subgroup, the increase in risk of an EBCE was 3.0-fold (P = 0.001). Preclinical laboratory studies examined mechanisms of action in addition to aromatase inhibition and showed that only anastrozole could directly bind to estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1), activate estrogen response element-dependent transcription, and stimulate growth of an aromatase-deficient CYP19A1\u2212/\u2212 T47D breast cancer cell line. Conclusions: This matched case\u2013control clinical study revealed that levels of estrone and estradiol above identified thresholds after 6 months of adjuvant anastrozole treatment were associated with increased risk of an EBCE. Preclinical laboratory studies revealed that anastrozole, but not exemestane or letrozole, is a ligand for ER\u03b1. These findings represent potential steps towards individualized anastrozole therapy.",

Personalized medicine approaches\u2014which involve parsing patients into subgroups better indicated for a particular treatment\u2014could therefore improve patient outcomes and serve as a powerful tool in patient selection within clinical trials. Machine learning approaches can identify patient subgroups but are often not \u201cexplainable\u201d due to the use of complex algorithms that do not mirror clinicians\u2019 natural decision-making processes. Methods Here we combine two analytical approaches\u2014Personalized Advantage Index and Bayesian Rule Lists\u2014to identify paliperidone-indicated schizophrenia patients in a way that emphasizes model explainability. We apply these approaches retrospectively to randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial data to identify a paliperidone-indicated subgroup of schizophrenia patients who demonstrate a larger treatment effect (outcome on treatment superior than on placebo) than that of the full randomized sample as assessed with Cohen\u2019s d. For this study, the outcome corresponded to a reduction in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score which measures positive (e.g., hallucinations, delusions), negative (e.g., blunted affect, emotional withdrawal), and general psychopathological (e.g., disturbance of volition, uncooperativeness) symptoms in schizophrenia. Results Using our combined explainable AI approach to identify a subgroup more responsive to paliperidone than placebo, the treatment effect increased significantly over that of the full sample (p\u2009<\u20090.0001 for a one-sample t-test comparing the full sample Cohen\u2019s d\u2009=\u20090.82 and a generated distribution of subgroup Cohen\u2019s d\u2019s with mean d\u2009=\u20091.22, std d\u2009=\u20090.09). In addition, our modeling approach produces simple logical statements ( if\u2013then-else) , termed a \u201crule list\u201d, to ease interpretability for clinicians. A majority of the rule lists generated from cross-validation found two general psychopathology symptoms, disturbance of volition and uncooperativeness, to predict membership in the paliperidone-indicated subgroup. Conclusions These results help to technically validate our explainable AI approach to patient selection for a clinical trial by identifying a subgroup with an improved treatment effect. With these data, the explainable rule lists also suggest that paliperidone may provide an improved therapeutic benefit for the treatment of schizophrenia patients with either of the symptoms of high disturbance of volition or high uncooperativeness.

However, traditional machine learning (ML) methods, while capable of identifying patient subgroups, often lack \"explainability\" due to complex algorithms, making them difficult for clinicians to interpret and trust for decision-making \\cite{mellem2021p29}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches**: The Personalized Advantage Index (PAI) method has been developed to identify \"treatment-indicated\" patient subgroups who may be more responsive to a specific treatment \\cite{mellem2021p29}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Prior PAI applications, while identifying predictive variables, suffered from insufficient explainability. They relied on interpreting regression coefficients and did not provide clear cutoffs for predictor variables, failing to mirror clinicians' natural decision-making processes \\cite{mellem2021p29}.\n    *   **Positioning**: This work combines PAI with Bayesian Rule Lists (BRL) to overcome PAI's explainability limitations, building on previous testing of this combined approach in depression \\cite{mellem2021p29}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: A two-step combined analytical approach:\n        1.  **Personalized Advantage Index (PAI) Modeling**: Uses an Elastic Net regressor to predict actual and counterfactual (hypothetical) post-treatment outcomes (6-week PANSS scores) for individual patients based on baseline features. It calculates a PAI score (predicted drug outcome \u2013 predicted placebo outcome) and thresholds it to label patients as \"treatment-indicated\" or \"rest-indicated\" \\cite{mellem2021p29}.\n        2.  **Bayesian Rule Lists (BRL) Modeling**: Takes the same baseline features and the PAI-generated \"treatment-indicated\" labels as input. It then uses sequenced logical rules and Bayesian inference to create a highly explainable classifier, generating simple \"if-then-else\" statements (rule lists) that classify patients \\cite{mellem2021p29}.\n    *   **Novelty**: The innovation lies in the *integration* of PAI for robust subgroup identification with BRL for generating *interpretable, clinician-friendly decision rules*. This directly addresses the critical need for explainable AI (XAI) in clinical decision support, providing clear Boolean criteria with cutoffs that resonate with clinical reasoning \\cite{mellem2021p29}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Method**: Development and validation of an explainable AI framework that combines PAI and BRL for identifying patient subgroups with improved treatment effects \\cite{mellem2021p29}.\n    *   **Algorithmic Integration**: Demonstrates how to effectively use PAI's predictive power to generate \"ground truth\" labels for training a highly interpretable BRL classifier, thereby enhancing the clinical utility of predictive models \\cite{mellem2021p29}.\n    *   **Output Format**: Produces simple, logical \"rule lists\" (e.g., \"If symptom X > threshold, then patient is treatment-indicated\") that are directly actionable and understandable by clinicians, contrasting with complex regression coefficients \\cite{mellem2021p29}.\n    *   **Application**: Retrospective validation of this XAI approach for patient selection in a schizophrenia clinical trial, demonstrating its ability to identify a subgroup with a significantly larger treatment effect \\cite{mellem2021p29}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Retrospective analysis of a 6-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (NCT 00083668) evaluating paliperidone in schizophrenia patients \\cite{mellem2021p29}. Data from the 15 mg/day paliperidone arm (n=113) and placebo arm (n=120) were used \\cite{mellem2021p29}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Results**:\n        *   **PAI Regression**: The Elastic Net regressor explained 58% of the variance in week 6 PANSS scores (adjusted R2 = 0.32) \\cite{mellem2021p29}.\n        *   **BRL Classifier Performance**: Achieved an accuracy of 74.1% and an AUC of 0.74 in classifying PAI-labeled patients using fivefold cross-validation \\cite{mellem2021p29}.\n        *   **Treatment Effect Improvement**: The BRL-identified treatment-indicated subgroup demonstrated a significantly larger treatment effect (mean Cohen's d = 1.22, std d = 0.09) compared to the full randomized sample (Cohen's d = 0.82), with a p-value < 0.0001 (one-sample t-test) \\cite{mellem2021p29}.\n        *   **Explainability**: Generated rule lists consistently identified \"disturbance of volition\" and \"uncooperativeness\" (two general psychopathology symptoms) as key predictors for membership in the paliperidone-indicated subgroup \\cite{mellem2021p29}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**:\n        *   Requires both baseline and post-treatment measurements to learn baseline characteristics of a treatment-indicated subgroup \\cite{mellem2021p29}.\n        *   PAI-generated labels serve as \"relative ground-truth\" for BRL training, as true counterfactual predictions are inherently unknown \\cite{mellem2021p29}.\n        *   The \"final\" BRL model trained on the full dataset was not externally validated in this study \\cite{mellem2021p29}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**:\n        *   May not be suitable for clinical trial patient selection when no similar prior trial data exists \\cite{mellem2021p29}.\n        *   The PAI score threshold selection (e.g., 50% allocation) balances algorithmic and clinical needs and may require re-evaluation for different scenarios \\cite{mellem2021p29}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: This work technically validates an explainable AI approach for patient selection, moving beyond \"black box\" models to provide transparent, interpretable insights for clinical decision-making in psychiatric disorders \\cite{mellem2021p29}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n        *   Enables the retrospective analysis of existing clinical trial data (including negative trials) to identify optimal patient subgroups, informing the design of more targeted and successful future trials \\cite{mellem2021p29}.\n        *   Offers a pathway to develop decision-making support systems for clinicians, facilitating personalized prescription of existing medications based on patient profiles \\cite{mellem2021p29}.\n        *   Provides a methodology to enrich clinical trial populations for patients most likely to respond, thereby increasing treatment effect sizes and improving trial efficiency \\cite{mellem2021p29}.\n        *   The specific rule lists generated offer novel hypotheses about which baseline symptoms (e.g., disturbance of volition, uncooperativeness) may indicate a better therapeutic benefit from paliperidone in schizophrenia \\cite{mellem2021p29}.",

In addition to quantitative criteria, the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) standards include subjective evaluation which introduces inter-rater variability and potential mistakes. We explored the value of artificial intelligence (AI)-based software (ArtiQ.QC) to assess spirometry quality and compared it to traditional over-reading control. Methods A random sample of 2000 sessions (8258 curves) was selected from Chiesi COPD and asthma trials (n=1000 per disease). Acceptability using the 2005 ATS/ERS standards was determined by over-reader review and by ArtiQ.QC. Additionally, three respiratory physicians jointly reviewed a subset of curves (n=150). Results The majority of curves (n=7267, 88%) were of good quality. The AI agreed with over-readers in 91% of cases, with 97% sensitivity and 93% positive predictive value. Performance was significantly better in the asthma group. In the revised subset, n=50 curves were repeated to assess intra-rater reliability (\u03ba=0.83, 0.86 and 0.80 for each of the three reviewers). All reviewers agreed on 63% of 100 unique tests (\u03ba=0.5). When reviewers set the consensus (gold standard), individual agreement with it was 88%, 94% and 70%. The agreement between AI and \u201cgold-standard\u201d was 73%; over-reader agreement was 46%. Conclusion AI-based software can be used to measure spirometry data quality with comparable accuracy as experts. The assessment is a subjective exercise, with intra- and inter-rater variability even when the criteria are defined very precisely and objectively. By providing consistent results and immediate feedback to the sites, AI may benefit clinical trial conduct and variability reduction. In clinical trials, AI software can be used with high accuracy to evaluate the quality of spirometry data.

Over the past decades, a number of approaches have been developed to address different types and needs of system intelligence ranging from search strategies to knowledge representation and inference to robotic planning. In the context of radiation treatment planning, multiple AI approaches may be adopted to improve the planning quality and efficiency. For example, knowledge representation and inference methods may improve dose prescription by integrating and reasoning about the domain knowledge described in many clinical guidelines and clinical trials reports. In this review, we will focus on the most studied AI approach in intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)/volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT)-machine learning (ML) and describe our recent efforts in applying ML to improve the quality, consistency, and efficiency of IMRT/VMAT planning. With the available high-quality data, we can build models to accurately predict critical variables for each step of the planning process and thus automate and improve its outcomes. Specific to the IMRT/VMAT planning process, we can build models for each of the four critical components in the process: dose-volume histogram (DVH), Dose, Fluence, and Human Planner. These models can be divided into two general groups. The first group focuses on encoding prior experience and knowledge through ML and more recently deep learning (DL) from prior clinical plans and using these models to predict the optimal DVH (DVH prediction model), or 3D dose distribution (dose prediction model), or fluence map (fluence map model). The goal of these models is to reduce or remove the trial-and-error process and guarantee consistently high-quality plans. The second group of models focuses on mimicking human planners' decision-making process (planning strategy model) during the iterative adjustments/guidance of the optimization engine. Each critical step of the IMRT/VMAT treatment planning process can be improved and automated by AI methods. As more training data becomes available and more sophisticated models are developed, we can expect that the AI methods in treatment planning will continue to improve accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.",

Presently, there are no validated predictive biomarkers to guide ADT use or duration in such men. Herein, we train and validate the first predictive biomarker for ADT use in prostate cancer using multiple phase III NRG Oncology randomized trials. Methods: Pre-treatment biopsy slides were digitized from five phase III NRG Oncology randomized trials of men receiving RT with or without ADT. The training set to develop the artificial intelligence (AI)-derived predictive biomarker included NRG/RTOG 9202, 9413, 9910, and 0126, and was trained to predict distant metastasis (DM). A multimodal deep learning architecture was developed to learn from both clinicopathologic and digital imaging histopathology data and identify differential outcomes by treatment type. After the model was locked, an independent biostatistician performed validation on NRG/RTOG 9408, a phase III randomized trial of RT +/- 4 months of ADT. The DM rates were calculated using cumulative incidence functions in biomarker positive and negative groups, and biomarker-treatment interaction was assessed using Fine-Gray regression such that death without DM was treated as a competing event. Results: Clinical and histopathological data was available for 5,654 of 7,957 eligible patients (71.1%). The training cohort included 3,935 patients and had a median follow-up of 13.6 years (IQR [10.2, 17.7]). After the AI-derived predictive ADT classifier was trained, it was validated in NRG/RTOG 9408 (n = 1719, median follow-up 17.6 years, IQR [15.0, 19.7]). In the NRG/RTOG 9408 validation cohort that had digital histopathology data, ADT significantly improved DM (HR 0.62, 95% CI [0.44, 0.87], p = 0.006), consistent with the published trial results. The biomarker-treatment interaction was significant (p-value = 0.0021). In patients with AI-biomarker positive disease (n = 673, 39%), ADT had a greater benefit compared to RT alone (HR 0.33, 95% CI [0.19, 0.57], p < 0.001). In the biomarker negative subgroup (n = 1046, 61%), the addition of ADT did not improve outcomes over RT alone (HR 1.00, 95% CI [0.64, 1.57], p = 0.99). The 15-year DM rate difference between RT versus RT+ADT in the biomarker negative group was 0.3%, vs biomarker positive group 9.4%. Conclusions: We have successfully validated in a phase III randomized trial the first predictive biomarker of ADT benefit with RT in localized intermediate risk prostate cancer using a novel AI-derived digital pathology-based platform. This AI-derived predictive biomarker demonstrates that a majority of patients treated with RT on NRG/RTOG 9408 did not require ADT and could have avoided the associated costs and side effects of this treatment.",

        "abstract": "Modern AI-based clinical decision support models owe their success in part to the very large number of predictors they use. Safe and robust decision support, especially for intervention planning, requires causal, not associative, relationships. Traditional methods of causal discovery, clinical trials and extracting biochemical pathways, are resource intensive and may not scale up to the number and complexity of relationships sufficient for precision treatment planning. Computational causal structure discovery (CSD) from electronic health records (EHR) data can represent a solution, however, current CSD methods fall short on EHR data. This paper presents a CSD method tailored to the EHR data. The application of the proposed methodology was demonstrated on type-2 diabetes mellitus. A large EHR dataset from Mayo Clinic was used as development cohort, and another large dataset from an independent health system, M Health Fairview, as external validation cohort. The proposed method achieved very high recall (.95) and substantially higher precision than the general-purpose methods (.84 versus .29, and .55). The causal relationships extracted from the development and external validation cohorts had a high (81%) overlap. Due to the adaptations to EHR data, the proposed method is more suitable for use in clinical decision support than the general-purpose methods.",

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for literature review, emphasizing technical innovations and empirical validation:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   The paper addresses the critical need for discovering *causal* relationships, not merely associations, from Electronic Health Records (EHR) data to enable safe and robust clinical decision support, particularly for intervention planning \\cite{shen2021xir}.\n    *   This problem is important because intervening on correlates rather than causal factors can lead to ineffective treatments, under/overtreatment, or iatrogenic harm \\cite{shen2021xir}.\n    *   It is challenging because traditional causal discovery methods (randomized clinical trials, biochemical pathway elucidation) are resource-intensive and do not scale to the complexity of relationships needed for precision medicine \\cite{shen2021xir}. Furthermore, general-purpose computational Causal Structure Discovery (CSD) methods fall short when applied directly to EHR data due to specific data quality and study design challenges \\cite{shen2021xir}. These challenges include:\n        *   Lack of inherent study design in EHR data (e.g., billing codes don't distinguish new incidences from pre-existing conditions).\n        *   Unreliable timestamps (documentation time vs. disease onset, leading to temporal reversals).\n        *   Difficulty in orienting causal edges due to statistical equivalence, even when a clear causal direction exists \\cite{shen2021xir}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   The work positions itself against general-purpose CSD algorithms, specifically Fast Greedy Equivalence Search (FGES), which the authors previously found to outperform other CSD methods \\cite{shen2021xir}.\n    *   Limitations of previous solutions (general-purpose CSD methods) on EHR data include:\n        *   Inability to account for the distinction between incident and pre-existing conditions.\n        *   Susceptibility to noisy or inaccurate timestamps, leading to incorrect temporal ordering and \"causal\" relationships in the wrong direction.\n        *   Failure to robustly orient edges, resulting in undirected causal relationships \\cite{shen2021xir}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   The core technical approach involves a novel two-part methodology: a data transformation procedure and a modified causal search algorithm, both tailored for EHR data \\cite{shen2021xir}.\n    *   **Data Transformation Method**: This procedure transforms longitudinal EHR data into \"disease-related events\" by distinguishing *incident* events (occurring in a later time window but not an earlier one) from *pre-existing* conditions \\cite{shen2021xir}. It then determines a \"precedence\" relationship between event pairs: event A precedes event B if, among patients with both, B is significantly more likely to be incident than A. This allows for robust temporal ordering despite noisy EHR timestamps \\cite{shen2021xir}.\n    *   **Proposed CSD Search Algorithm**: This algorithm modifies an existing CSD method (FGES) by incorporating the precedence relationships derived from the data transformation. It constructs a causal graph by iteratively adding edges, but critically, the *orientation of each added edge must be consistent with the established precedence relationship* (i.e., from the preceding event to the subsequent event) \\cite{shen2021xir}. The algorithm uses the BIC criterion for goodness-of-fit, estimating the likelihood of an event in a later time window given its parents in an earlier time window via logistic regression \\cite{shen2021xir}.\n    *   **Novelty**: The approach is novel in its explicit adaptations to EHR data challenges:\n        *   Systematic handling of incident vs. pre-existing conditions.\n        *   A robust method for inferring temporal precedence from noisy longitudinal data.\n        *   Directly leveraging this temporal precedence to constrain and orient causal edges during graph construction, thereby overcoming the statistical equivalence problem that often leaves edges undirected in general-purpose CSD methods \\cite{shen2021xir}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Data Transformation**: A procedure to define and identify \"incident\" and \"pre-existing\" disease-related events and establish robust \"precedence\" relationships between them from longitudinal EHR data, mitigating timestamp inaccuracies \\cite{shen2021xir}.\n    *   **Modified Causal Search Algorithm**: An adaptation of the FGES algorithm that integrates these precedence relationships to enforce temporal consistency and robustly orient causal edges, leading to a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) \\cite{shen2021xir}.\n    *   **Improved Edge Orientation**: The proposed method effectively eliminates ambiguously oriented edges, a significant improvement over general-purpose CSD methods \\cite{shen2021xir}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Datasets**: The methodology was developed using a large EHR dataset from Mayo Clinic (MC) as the development cohort and externally validated on an independent large dataset from M Health Fairview (FV) \\cite{shen2021xir}.\n    *   **Clinical Context**: The application was demonstrated on Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2D), its risk factors, and complications, chosen due to its extensive existing knowledge base for evaluation \\cite{shen2021xir}.\n    *   **Evaluation Metrics**:\n        *   **Stability**: Measured by running 1000 bootstrap replicas and reporting the percentage of ambiguously oriented edges.\n        *   **Precision**: Defined as 1 minus the proportion of incorrect edges (edges without associative evidence or contradicted by causal evidence).\n        *   **Causal Recall**: Percentage of known causal relationships (from clinical trials) discovered.\n        *   **Associative Recall**: Percentage of known associative relationships explained by a path in the graph.\n    *   **Comparison**: Three methods were compared: (1) FGES + raw (FGES on raw data), (2) FGES + transf (FGES on transformed data), and (3) Proposed (proposed search algorithm on transformed data) \\cite{shen2021xir}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   **Directional Stability**: The proposed data transformation reduced ambiguously oriented edges from 45% (FGES + raw) to 24% (FGES + transf), and the *proposed search method eliminated all ambiguously oriented edges (0%)* \\cite{shen2021xir}.\n        *   **Precision**: The proposed method achieved substantially higher precision (0.838) compared to FGES + raw (0.294) and FGES + transf (0.55) \\cite{shen2021xir}.\n        *   **Recall**: All three methods achieved \"almost perfect\" associative recall, and the proposed method achieved very high causal recall (0.95) \\cite{shen2021xir}.\n        *   **External Validation**: 81% (60 out of 74) of the discovered causal edges coincided between the MC and FV datasets, demonstrating robustness across independent health systems \\cite{shen2021xir}. Discordant edges were attributed to policy differences, lack of clear precedence, or differential confounding \\cite{shen2021xir}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**: The paper does not explicitly detail theoretical limitations of the modified BIC score or the greedy search strategy beyond what is inherent to FGES. The reliance on \"precedence\" relationships assumes that a significant temporal ordering can be reliably extracted from EHR data for the variables of interest.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: While demonstrated on T2D, the methods are expected to generalize to other chronic diseases that exhibit similar characteristics and suffer from the same EHR shortcomings \\cite{shen2021xir}. The method's effectiveness might be reduced for acute conditions where rapid onset and documentation might make the \"incident vs. pre-existing\" distinction less clear or where temporal relationships are less stable.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   This work significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in causal discovery from real-world observational EHR data by providing a robust methodology specifically designed to overcome its inherent challenges \\cite{shen2021xir}.\n    *   By achieving high precision and recall, and eliminating ambiguously oriented edges, the proposed method generates more reliable and interpretable causal graphs than general-purpose CSD algorithms \\cite{shen2021xir}.\n    *   **Potential Impact**: The ability to extract robust causal relationships from EHR data has profound implications for developing more effective and safer AI-based clinical decision support systems, particularly for intervention planning and precision treatment, moving beyond mere associative insights \\cite{shen2021xir}. It opens avenues for discovering causal pathways in complex chronic diseases where randomized controlled trials are impractical.",

Materials and Methods This was a HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board-approved retrospective study. From March 15 to June 1, 2020, 250 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients were studied with low-dose chest CT at admission. Visual and AI-assisted analysis of lung involvement was performed by using a semi-quantitative CT score and a quantitative percentage of lung involvement. Adverse outcome was defined as intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death. Cox regression analysis, Kaplan-Meier curves, and cross-validated receiver operating characteristic curve with area under the curve (AUROC) analysis was performed to compare model performance. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and Bland- Altman analysis was used to assess intra- and interreader reproducibility. Results Adverse outcome occurred in 39 patients (11 deaths, 28 ICU admissions). AUC values from AI-assisted analysis were significantly higher than those from visual analysis for both semi-quantitative CT scores and percentages of lung involvement (all P<0.001). Intrareader and interreader agreement rates were significantly higher for AI-assisted analysis than visual analysis (all ICC \u22650.960 versus \u22650.885).

Manual QT measurements by expert ECG analysts are expensive, laborious and prone to errors. Wavelet-based delineators and other automatic methods do not generalize well to different T wave morphologies and may require laborious tuning. Our study investigates the robustness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for QT measurement. We trained 3 CNN-based deep learning models on a private ECG database with human expert-annotated QT intervals. Among these models, we propose a U-Net model, which is widely used for segmentation tasks, to build a novel clinically useful QT estimator that includes QT delineation for better interpretability. We tested the 3 models on four external databases, amongst which a clinical trial investigating four drugs. Our results show that the deep learning models are in stronger agreement with the experts than the state-of-the-art wavelet-based algorithm. Indeed, the deep learning models yielded up to 71% of accurate QT measurements (absolute difference between manual and automatic QT below 15 ms) whereas the wavelet-based algorithm only allowed 52% of QT accuracy. For the 2 studies of drugs with small to no QT prolonging effect, a mean absolute difference of 6 ms (std = 5 ms) was obtained between the manual and deep learning methods. For the other 2 drugs with more significant effect on the volunteers, a mean difference of up to 17 ms (std = 17 ms) was obtained. The proposed models are therefore promising for automated QT measurements during clinical trials. They can analyze various ECG morphologies from a diversity of individuals although some QT-prolonged ECGs can be challenging. The U-Net model is particularly interesting for our application as it facilitates expert review of automatic QT intervals, which is still required by regulatory bodies, by providing QRS onset and T offset positions that are consistent with the estimated QT intervals.",

Digital health technologies can contribute to addressing this challenge; however, little is known about their effectiveness in at-home settings. In response, we have designed the RGS@home study to investigate the effectiveness, acceptance, and cost of a deep tech solution called the Rehabilitation Gaming System (RGS). RGS is a cloud-based system for delivering AI-enhanced rehabilitation using virtual reality, motion capture, and wearables that can be used in the hospital and at home. The core principles of the brain theory-based RGS intervention are to deliver rehabilitation exercises in the form of embodied, goal-oriented, and task-specific action. Methods The RGS@home study is a randomized longitudinal clinical trial designed to assess whether the combination of the RGS intervention with standard care is superior to standard care alone for the functional recovery of stroke patients at the hospital and at home. The study is conducted in collaboration with hospitals in Spain, Sweden, and France and includes inpatients and outpatients at subacute and chronic stages post-stroke. The intervention duration is 3 months with assessment at baseline and after 3, 6, and 12 months. The impact of RGS is evaluated in terms of quality of life measurements, usability, and acceptance using standardized clinical scales, together with health economic analysis.

The lack of communication among professionals may produce a non-optimization of patients\u2019 accrual in clinical trials. We developed a specific platform, called \u201cDigital Research Assistant\u201d (DRA), to report real-time every available clinical trial and support clinician. Healthcare professionals involved in breast cancer working group agreed nine minimal fields of interest to preliminarily classify the characteristics of patients\u2019 records (including omic data, such as genomic mutations). A progressive web app (PWA) was developed to implement a cross-platform software that was scalable on several electronic devices to share the patients\u2019 records and clinical trials.

The lack of communication among professionals may produce a non-optimization of patients\u2019 accrual in clinical trials. We developed a specific platform, called \u201cDigital Research Assistant\u201d (DRA), to report real-time every available clinical trial and support clinician. Healthcare professionals involved in breast cancer working group agreed nine minimal fields of interest to preliminarily classify the characteristics of patients\u2019 records (including omic data, such as genomic mutations).

As the histological features differentiating stage 1 (F1) from stage 2 (F2) NASH fibrosis are subtle, some patients may be wrongly staged by the in-house pathologist and miss the opportunity for enrollment into clinical trials. We hypothesized that our refined artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithm (qFibrosis) can identify these subtle differences and serve as an assistive tool for in-house pathologists.

Results: Twenty-eight parameters (20 periportal and 8 perisinusoidal) were significantly different between the F1 and F2 cases that prompted a change of stage after a careful consensus read. The discriminatory ability of these parameters was further demonstrated in a comparison between the true F1 and true F2 cases as 26 out of the 28 parameters showed significant differences.

However, little is known about the current status of trials on artificial intelligence (AI) conducted in emergency department and intensive care unit. The objective of the study was to provide a comprehensive analysis of registered trials in such field based on ClinicalTrials.gov. Methods: Registered trials on AI conducted in emergency department and intensive care unit were searched on ClinicalTrials.gov up to 12th January 2021. The characteristics were analyzed using SPSS21.0 software. Results: A total of 146 registered trials were identified, including 61 in emergency department and 85 in intensive care unit. They were registered from 2004 to 2021. Regarding locations, 58 were conducted in Europe, 58 in America, 9 in Asia, 4 in Australia, and 17 did not report locations. The enrollment of participants was from 0 to 18,000,000, with a median of 233. Universities were the primary sponsors, which accounted for 43.15%, followed by hospitals (35.62%), and industries/companies (9.59%). Regarding study designs, 85 trials were interventional trials, while 61 were observational trials. Of the 85 interventional trials, 15.29% were for diagnosis and 38.82% for treatment; of the 84 observational trials, 42 were prospective, 14 were retrospective, 2 were cross-sectional, 2 did not report clear information and 1 was unknown. Regarding the trials' results, 69 trials had been completed, while only 10 had available results on ClinicalTrials.gov. Conclusions: Our study suggest that more AI trials are needed in emergency department and intensive care unit and sponsors are encouraged to report the results.",

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper for a literature review, emphasizing technical innovations and empirical validation:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   The paper addresses the lack of comprehensive information regarding the current status of Artificial Intelligence (AI) clinical trials specifically conducted in Emergency Departments (ED) and Intensive Care Units (ICU) \\cite{liu2021lc8}.\n    *   This problem is critical because AI is increasingly integrated into clinical practice for tasks like diagnosis, decision support, and personalized healthcare, especially in acute events. ED and ICU settings are high-stakes environments where early and accurate interventions are vital, making well-designed trials essential to assess AI's utility. However, a systematic overview of these trials, crucial for understanding progress and ensuring transparency, was missing \\cite{liu2021lc8}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   This work positions itself as the first comprehensive cross-sectional study to analyze registered AI clinical trials specifically within ED and ICU settings on ClinicalTrials.gov \\cite{liu2021lc8}.\n    *   It acknowledges the existence of similar analyses for other medical fields (e.g., acupuncture, cancer diagnosis) but highlights the significant limitation of previous research: the absence of such a focused analysis for AI applications in critical and emergency care.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   The core technical approach is a **cross-sectional meta-analysis** of registered clinical trials, rather than proposing a new AI algorithm. The innovation lies in its systematic and comprehensive methodology for mapping the landscape of AI trials in a specific, high-impact medical domain \\cite{liu2021lc8}.\n    *   **Methodology:** A systematic search was conducted on ClinicalTrials.gov up to January 12, 2021, using a broad range of AI-related keywords (e.g., \"artificial intelligence,\" \"machine learning,\" \"deep learning,\" \"robotics\").\n    *   **Data Selection:** Trials were included if they focused on AI and were conducted exclusively in ED or ICU.\n    *   **Data Analysis:** Descriptive statistical methods (median, IQR, frequencies, percentages) were used to characterize study types, registration years, enrollment, participant demographics, status, results availability, sponsors, funding, locations, and detailed study designs (e.g., primary purpose, intervention model, allocation, masking) using SPSS21.0 \\cite{liu2021lc8}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Systematic Characterization:** Provides the first detailed statistical overview of the characteristics and trends of registered AI clinical trials in ED and ICU settings \\cite{liu2021lc8}.\n    *   **Identification of Gaps:** Highlights critical deficiencies, particularly the extremely low rate of reported results for completed trials, which impedes knowledge dissemination and evidence-based practice \\cite{liu2021lc8}.\n    *   **Geographical and Sponsorship Insights:** Reveals the dominant geographical regions (Europe, America) and primary sponsors (universities, hospitals) driving these trials, while noting the limited industry involvement and sparse representation from regions like Asia \\cite{liu2021lc8}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   The \"validation\" is empirical, based on the systematic collection and analysis of publicly available trial data.\n    *   **Data Collection:** Identified 4,990 initial trials, ultimately including 146 eligible registered trials (61 in ED, 85 in ICU) after rigorous screening \\cite{liu2021lc8}.\n    *   **Key Findings/Metrics:**\n        *   **Growth Trend:** A significant increase in AI trial registrations was observed, with 51.37% of trials registered after 2017 \\cite{liu2021lc8}.\n        *   **Trial Types:** 58.22% were interventional trials, and 41.78% were observational \\cite{liu2021lc8}.\n        *   **Sponsorship:** Universities (43.15%) and hospitals (35.62%) were the predominant sponsors, with industry/companies accounting for only 9.59% \\cite{liu2021lc8}.\n        *   **Geographical Distribution:** Europe and America each accounted for 39.73% of trials, while Asia had only 6.16% \\cite{liu2021lc8}.\n        *   **Result Reporting:** A critical finding was that only 10 out of 69 completed trials (6.85%) had available results on ClinicalTrials.gov, with 0% of observational ICU trials reporting results \\cite{liu2021lc8}.\n        *   **Purpose:** For interventional trials, treatment (38.82%) and prevention (18.82%) were common primary purposes \\cite{liu2021lc8}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   The study's findings are limited to trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, potentially missing trials registered elsewhere or not registered at all \\cite{liu2021lc8}.\n    *   It provides a cross-sectional snapshot and does not delve into the methodological quality or specific technical details of the AI interventions themselves.\n    *   The scope is restricted to AI trials in ED and ICU, not encompassing other medical specialties.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   This study significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing the first comprehensive, data-driven landscape of AI clinical trials in critical and emergency care \\cite{liu2021lc8}.\n    *   It serves as a foundational reference for understanding the current research ecosystem, identifying areas of strength and weakness.\n    *   The findings have a substantial potential impact on future research by highlighting the urgent need for more rigorous trials, particularly in underrepresented regions, and by strongly advocating for improved transparency through mandatory reporting of trial results to ensure evidence-based development and deployment of AI in these crucial medical settings \\cite{liu2021lc8}.",

Materials and methods The Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CBM, CNKI, VIP and Wanfang databases were systematically searched (date range: inception to December 2020) using the key terms \u2018Kang-ai injection\u2019 and \u2018hepatocellular carcinoma\u2019. The current analysis included controlled clinical trials that compared the efficacy and safety of the combination of KAI and conventional treatment (CT) with CT alone for HCC. The current study estimated the pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Data pertaining to 35 trials with 2501 HCC patients were analysed. The results revealed that the combination of KAI and CT was associated with significantly superior objective response rate (RR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.43\u20131.73), disease control rate (RR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.10\u20131.26), and quality of life (RR = 2.40, 95% CI = 1.79\u20133.23), compared to CT alone. The administration of KAI significantly alleviated most of the adverse effects caused by CT, including nausea and vomiting, liver damage, peripheral neurotoxicity, fever, abdominal pain, alopecia, increased bilirubin levels, leukopoenia, and reduction in haemoglobin levels (p\u2009<\u20090.05, for all).

However, a lack of clinical data restricts the design and development of such AI tools, particularly in preparation for an impending crisis or pandemic. Objective This study aimed to develop and test the feasibility of a \u201cpatients-like-me\u201d framework to predict the deterioration of patients with COVID-19 using a retrospective cohort of patients with similar respiratory diseases. Methods Our framework used COVID-19\u2013like cohorts to design and train AI models that were then validated on the COVID-19 population. The COVID-19\u2013like cohorts included patients diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, unspecified pneumonia, influenza, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) at an academic medical center from 2008 to 2019. In total, 15 training cohorts were created using different combinations of the COVID-19\u2013like cohorts with the ARDS cohort for exploratory purposes. In this study, two machine learning models were developed: one to predict invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) within 48 hours for each hospitalized day, and one to predict all-cause mortality at the time of admission. Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. We established model interpretability by calculating SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) scores to identify important features. Results Compared to the COVID-19\u2013like cohorts (n=16,509), the patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (n=159) were significantly younger, with a higher proportion of patients of Hispanic ethnicity, a lower proportion of patients with smoking history, and fewer patients with comorbidities (P<.001). Patients with COVID-19 had a lower IMV rate (15.1 versus 23.2, P=.02) and shorter time to IMV (2.9 versus 4.1 days, P<.001) compared to the COVID-19\u2013like patients. In the COVID-19\u2013like training data, the top models achieved excellent performance (AUROC>0.90). Validating in the COVID-19 cohort, the top-performing model for predicting IMV was the XGBoost model (AUROC=0.826) trained on the viral pneumonia cohort. Similarly, the XGBoost model trained on all 4 COVID-19\u2013like cohorts without ARDS achieved the best performance (AUROC=0.928) in predicting mortality. Important predictors included demographic information (age), vital signs (oxygen saturation), and laboratory values (white blood cell count, cardiac troponin, albumin, etc). Our models had class imbalance, which resulted in high negative predictive values and low positive predictive values.

        "abstract": "A shortage of radiologists is increasingly putting UK breast cancer screening under strain, and with more breast radiologists retiring than new radiologists being appointed/trained, this burden is set to increase. One possible partial solution is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in breast screening mammogram interpretation to meet this future need. Various groups have demonstrated the potential use of AI in retrospective studies although few have demonstrated its utility, in situ, in large prospective randomised control trials, the conventional way of demonstrating clinical and operational utility. The next step in this technology\u2019s evolution is to determine how best to implement it. Should AI replace all human readers, partially replace them, or operate as a reader assistant/companion? Population screening relies on the test (and its interpretation) being acceptable to those participating. However, little is known about the views of the breast cancer screening population on the use of AI in interpreting breast screening mammograms. Data published recently from a Dutch survey of women aged 16\u201375 do demonstrate overall good acceptance of AI especially when used alongside human screen readers. In October 2020, using a standardised paper questionnaire, we sought to obtain NHS Grampian screening participants\u2019 views on the use of AI in interpreting breast screening mammograms, with the aim of designing a prospective study agreeable to the screening population. The questionnaire was designed with help from social scientists and reviewed by University of Aberdeen ethics committee. Its execution was aided by a local charity/patient group and tested for clarity in a similar population to our sample. The complete questionnaire is available in the supplementary material and on our study website (https://icaird.com/ about/public-engagement). After describing the current UK system of dual reader screening followed by arbitration reading if required, we posed four different AI scenarios and asked participants whether they approved or objected; 364 consecutive screening participants were offered the questionnaire, and 187 (51%) returned completed responses. Responses to the four key questions can be seen in Figure 1. We tested the differences in approval/objection for those that expressed a preference (not neutral) using a Chi-squared approach. Participants significantly approved of the introduction of AI for three out of the four scenarios presented. These scenarios involve both AI and human readers to varying degrees. Of these three scenarios, AI as a reader companion (Scenario 4) and AI replacing one human reader (Scenario 1) met with the most approval, while AI as a triage tool (Scenario 3) met with less approval. On average, participants neither approved nor disapproved of the boldest option (Scenario 2), the complete replacement of human readers. In addition to the scenarios, we asked participants their age; perceived knowledge of AI; and if they had a family history of breast cancer. Those with greater self-assessed knowledge of AI were more likely to approve of its introduction. Family history of breast cancer showed no association with AI approval. Age had a weak positive association with approval for Scenario 3, AI as a triage tool. The gains of each scenario are yet to be quantified; however, it is clear from these results that most of the screening population approves of (or does not object to) the introduction of AI techniques for breast screening. This approval is larger in a subsample who have some self-perceived knowledge or understanding of AI. It is our understanding that these are the first published data demonstrating the effect that perceived understanding of AI has on the likelihood of acceptance of AI within breast cancer screening mammography.

        "summary": "A shortage of radiologists is increasingly putting UK breast cancer screening under strain, and with more breast radiologists retiring than new radiologists being appointed/trained, this burden is set to increase. One possible partial solution is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in breast screening mammogram interpretation to meet this future need. Various groups have demonstrated the potential use of AI in retrospective studies although few have demonstrated its utility, in situ, in large prospective randomised control trials, the conventional way of demonstrating clinical and operational utility. The next step in this technology\u2019s evolution is to determine how best to implement it. Should AI replace all human readers, partially replace them, or operate as a reader assistant/companion? Population screening relies on the test (and its interpretation) being acceptable to those participating. However, little is known about the views of the breast cancer screening population on the use of AI in interpreting breast screening mammograms. Data published recently from a Dutch survey of women aged 16\u201375 do demonstrate overall good acceptance of AI especially when used alongside human screen readers. In October 2020, using a standardised paper questionnaire, we sought to obtain NHS Grampian screening participants\u2019 views on the use of AI in interpreting breast screening mammograms, with the aim of designing a prospective study agreeable to the screening population. The questionnaire was designed with help from social scientists and reviewed by University of Aberdeen ethics committee. Its execution was aided by a local charity/patient group and tested for clarity in a similar population to our sample. The complete questionnaire is available in the supplementary material and on our study website (https://icaird.com/ about/public-engagement). After describing the current UK system of dual reader screening followed by arbitration reading if required, we posed four different AI scenarios and asked participants whether they approved or objected; 364 consecutive screening participants were offered the questionnaire, and 187 (51%) returned completed responses. Responses to the four key questions can be seen in Figure 1. We tested the differences in approval/objection for those that expressed a preference (not neutral) using a Chi-squared approach. Participants significantly approved of the introduction of AI for three out of the four scenarios presented. These scenarios involve both AI and human readers to varying degrees.

This AE is attributed to a reduction of the estrogenic effect on hair follicles, leading them to enter a resting state and subsequent hair loss [2].

Objective: To examine symptoms of potential AI in a large population of normocortisolemic patients without CS treated with mifepristone, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of patients with CS. Methods: We conducted a pooled safety analysis of five phase 3, placebo-controlled clinical trials of normocortisolemic adults without CS but diagnosed with psychotic depression (n = 1460). Patients were treated with once-daily mifepristone 300 mg (n = 110), 600 mg (n = 471), or 1200 mg (n = 252), or placebo (n = 627) administered for 7 consecutive days. All study investigators were trained and instructed to assess for the development of AI and to report all adverse events (AEs) at each clinic visit. The incidence of (1) AI or similar terminologies and that of (2) \u22653 concurrent symptoms that could be associated with AI was evaluated. Results: Mean serum cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels increased dose dependently with mifepristone treatment. There were no reports of AI and no significant differences between the mifepristone-treated and placebo groups in the incidence of patients having \u22653 AEs that could be associated with AI. Conclusions: This large pooled analysis of normocortisolemic patients without CS found no cases of AI and no differences between mifepristone therapy and placebo in the incidence of symptom combinations mimicking AI, even at the highest (1200 mg) dose.

Following an extensive search in relevant databases and websites, we gathered publications tackling the use of AI and Machine Learning (ML) in CTs from the past 5 years in the US and Europe, including Regulatory Authorities\u2019 documents. Documented applications of AI commonly concern the oncology field and are mostly being applied in the area of recruitment. Main opportunities discussed aim to create efficiencies across CT activities, including the ability to reduce sample sizes, improve enrollment and conduct faster, more optimized adaptive CTs. While AI is an area of enthusiastic development, the identified challenges are ethical in nature and relate to data availability, standards, and most importantly, lack of regulatory guidance hindering the acceptance of AI tools in drug development. However, future implications are significant and are anticipated to improve the probability of success, reduce trial burden and overall, speed up research and regulatory approval.

Preclinical studies form the foundation of potential disease treatments, guiding their journey from scientific discovery to impactful patient outcomes.

The cause of this failure is potentially elucidated in a 2015 retrospective analysis of four large biotech companies that showed the most common causes of termination in phase I and II clinical trials since 2003 are the lack of efficacy (60% of all trials) and toxicity (30%) (5).

        "abstract": "Clinical trials in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH, formerly known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) require histologic scoring for assessment of inclusion criteria and endpoints. However, variability in interpretation has impacted clinical trial outcomes. We developed an artificial intelligence-based measurement (AIM) tool for scoring MASH histology (AIM-MASH). AIM-MASH predictions for MASH Clinical Research Network necroinflammation grades and fibrosis stages were reproducible (\u03ba\u2009=\u20091) and aligned with expert pathologist consensus scores (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.62\u20130.74). The AIM-MASH versus consensus agreements were comparable to average pathologists for MASH Clinical Research Network scores (82% versus 81%) and fibrosis (97% versus 96%). Continuous scores produced by AIM-MASH for key histological features of MASH correlated with mean pathologist scores and noninvasive biomarkers and strongly predicted progression-free survival in patients with stage 3 (P\u2009<\u20090.0001) and stage 4 (P\u2009=\u20090.03) fibrosis. In a retrospective analysis of the ATLAS trial (NCT03449446), responders receiving study treatment showed a greater continuous change in fibrosis compared with placebo (P\u2009=\u20090.02). Overall, these results suggest that AIM-MASH may assist pathologists in histologic review of MASH clinical trials, reducing inter-rater variability on trial outcomes and offering a more sensitive and reproducible measure of patient responses.",

        "summary": "Here is a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **1. Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** Clinical trials for Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH) critically rely on histologic scoring for patient enrollment and endpoint assessment. However, this manual assessment suffers from significant inter-rater variability among pathologists \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge:** This variability leads to limited sensitivity of scoring systems, incomplete measurement of treatment response, potential clinical trial failures, and inappropriate inclusion/exclusion of participants \\cite{iyer2024v43}. Such unreliability reduces the statistical power of trials to detect genuine drug effects, despite MASH being a progressive disease with increasing incidence and significant medical burden, and histologic endpoints being accepted by regulatory bodies (FDA, EMA) \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n\n*   **2. Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches:** Current practice involves manual histologic scoring by expert pathologists using systems like the MASH Clinical Research Network (CRN) for features such as steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocellular ballooning, and fibrosis \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n        *   Limited sensitivity of ordinal scoring systems to subtle changes \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n        *   High inter-pathologist variability, with reported instances of trial cohorts not meeting enrollment criteria upon re-evaluation \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n        *   Conventional intra-pathologist agreement for consecutive reads was variable (37% to 74%), indicating poor reproducibility \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n        *   While AI algorithms for digital pathology exist, they are not yet widely adopted in clinical settings or approved for clinical trial use \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n\n*   **3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper introduces AIM-MASH (AI-based Measurement for MASH histology), a digital pathology tool that employs a multi-model architecture combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n        *   **CNNs:** Trained on a large dataset of pathologist-annotated digitized H&E and Masson's trichrome (MT) whole-slide images (WSIs) to perform pixel-level segmentation and identification of various histological features (e.g., steatosis, ballooning, inflammation, fibrosis) and artifacts \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n        *   **GNNs:** Take the CNN-derived pixel-level predictions as input. They are trained to cluster these predictions based on spatial organization and then predict both ordinal MASH CRN grades/stages and novel continuous scores for each cardinal histologic feature \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:**\n        *   **Hybrid CNN-GNN Architecture:** This two-stage approach leverages CNNs for granular feature detection and GNNs for context-aware, slide-level scoring, capturing complex spatial relationships \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n        *   **Pathologist Bias Correction:** The GNN models were designed as 'mixed effects' models to learn and correct for inherent pathologist biases, ensuring that predictions are based on unbiased estimates \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n        *   **Continuous Scoring System:** AIM-MASH generates continuous scores in addition to ordinal grades, allowing for the detection of subtle histologic changes that occur within the range of an ordinal bin, offering enhanced sensitivity for measuring treatment response \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n        *   **Extensive Training Data:** The models were trained on over 100,000 pathologist annotations from thousands of WSIs sourced from multiple completed phase 2b and phase 3 MASH clinical trials \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n\n*   **4. Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms, Methods, or Techniques:**\n        *   A robust, multi-stage machine learning pipeline for automated, quantitative MASH histology assessment, integrating pixel-level segmentation with slide-level scoring \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n        *   An artifact detection and exclusion module (CNN-based) to ensure high-quality input for downstream analysis \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n        *   GNNs specifically designed to correct for inter-pathologist variability and bias in scoring \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n        *   The development and validation of a continuous scoring system for MASH CRN components, providing a more sensitive measure of disease activity and treatment effect \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n    *   **System Design or Architectural Innovations:**\n        *   A modular system that separates feature extraction (CNNs) from complex spatial reasoning and scoring (GNNs), enhancing interpretability and robustness \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n        *   The ability to generate visual overlays of AI-detected features on WSIs, facilitating qualitative review and quality control by pathologists \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n\n*   **5. Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:**\n        *   **Repeatability:** Assessed by comparing ten independent AIM-MASH reads per WSI \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n        *   **Accuracy:** Compared AIM-MASH predictions against a consensus of expert pathologists using a mixed leave-one-out approach on an external, held-out dataset \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n        *   **Clinical Utility (Enrollment & Endpoints):** Retrospectively applied AIM-MASH to WSIs from phase 2b MASH clinical trials to evaluate its performance in identifying eligible patients and assessing composite endpoints, comparing against central pathologist and expert consensus scores \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n        *   **Treatment Response Detection:** Performed a retrospective analysis of the ATLAS phase 2b clinical trial (NCT03449446) to measure drug efficacy, comparing AIM-MASH-derived ordinal and continuous changes with central pathologist assessments \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n        *   **Biological Relevance of Continuous Scores:** Correlated continuous scores with mean pathologist scores and various noninvasive test (NIT) metrics (e.g., FibroScan, Fibrosis-4, MRI-PDFF) \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results:**\n        *   **Repeatability:** AIM-MASH achieved perfect reproducibility (\u03ba=1) for all features, significantly surpassing reported intra-pathologist agreement (37-74%) \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n        *   **Accuracy:** Model vs. consensus agreement (\u03ba) ranged from 0.62 (fibrosis) to 0.74 (steatosis), which was comparable to or superior to mean pathologist vs. consensus and mean pairwise pathologist agreement \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n        *   **Clinical Utility:** AIM-MASH vs. consensus agreement for enrollment criteria (e.g., MAS\u22654 vs. <4: 0.82; F1-F3 vs. F4: 0.97) and endpoint assessment (e.g., fibrosis improvement: 0.80; MASH resolution: 0.86) was comparable to or moderately greater than average pathologist vs. consensus \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n        *   **Treatment Response:** In the ATLAS trial, AIM-MASH detected a greater proportion of treatment responders in the active treatment group for all measured endpoints compared to the central pathologist (e.g., \u22651-stage fibrosis improvement: 27% vs. 19%) \\cite{iyer2024v43}. Responders showed a greater continuous change in fibrosis compared with placebo (P=0.02) \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n        *   **Continuous Scoring:** Continuous scores significantly correlated with mean pathologist scores (e.g., steatosis \u03c4=0.74, P<0.001; fibrosis \u03c4=0.62, P<0.001) and relevant noninvasive biomarkers (e.g., continuous fibrosis stage with FibroScan \u03c4=0.33, P<0.001) \\cite{iyer2024v43}. They also strongly predicted progression-free survival in patients with stage 3 (P<0.0001) and stage 4 (P=0.03) fibrosis \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n\n*   **6. Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The model's performance is inherently tied to the quality and diversity of the pathologist annotations used for its extensive training \\cite{iyer2024v43}. While bias correction is implemented, the initial ground truth is still human-derived.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** AIM-MASH is specifically developed for MASH histology assessment in clinical trial settings, primarily using H&E and MT-stained WSIs \\cite{iyer2024v43}. It is presented as an assistive tool for pathologists, aiming to reduce variability and enhance sensitivity, rather than a complete replacement for expert review \\cite{iyer2024v43}. Regulatory approval for its clinical use is still a future step \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n\n*   **7. Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances the Technical State-of-the-Art:**\n        *   Establishes a new benchmark for reproducibility in MASH histology scoring with perfect agreement (\u03ba=1), significantly overcoming the long-standing challenge of inter-rater variability in manual assessment \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n        *   Introduces a novel and validated continuous scoring system that provides a more sensitive and quantitative measure of disease progression and treatment response than traditional ordinal scales \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n        *   Demonstrates the effective integration of CNNs for fine-grained feature detection with GNNs for complex, context-aware scoring, including a mechanism for pathologist bias correction \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:**\n        *   Could revolutionize MASH clinical trials by enabling more precise patient selection, more reliable endpoint assessment, and potentially reducing trial failures due to measurement variability \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n        *   The continuous scoring system offers a powerful tool for detecting subtle therapeutic effects, potentially accelerating drug development and identifying effective treatments that might be missed by coarser ordinal scales \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n        *   Provides a strong methodological framework for applying advanced AI (hybrid CNN-GNN architectures with bias correction) to other complex histopathological assessments where subjective scoring is a critical limitation \\cite{iyer2024v43}.\n        *   May influence future regulatory guidelines for the adoption of AI-powered digital pathology tools in clinical research and diagnostics \\cite{iyer2024v43}.",

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper by Sande et al. \\cite{sande20248hm} for a literature review:\n\n### Technical Paper Analysis: To warrant clinical adoption AI models require a multi-faceted implementation evaluation \\cite{sande20248hm}\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Problem:** Despite rapid AI advancements, the translation of AI models into clinical value and adoption at the bedside remains severely limited, with less than 2% of AI models moving beyond prototyping \\cite{sande20248hm}.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** Many AI-based Clinical Decision Support Systems (AICDSS) show promising statistical performance (e.g., high AUROC, accuracy) but fail to demonstrate improved patient outcomes or achieve clinical adoption due to factors like workflow disruption, lack of transparency, and user concerns \\cite{sande20248hm}. Traditional quantitative metrics are insufficient to evaluate real-world utility, necessitating a multi-faceted evaluation approach \\cite{sande20248hm}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches:** Current AI evaluation in healthcare primarily focuses on statistical performance metrics and clinical effectiveness, often through Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) \\cite{sande20248hm}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:** Existing guidelines (e.g., DECIDE-AI, CONSORT-AI) improve transparent reporting of technical model development but \"fail to offer adequate measures for evaluating the success of implementing an AI\" \\cite{sande20248hm}. This paper positions itself by empirically demonstrating this gap through a systematic analysis of existing RCTs, advocating for the integration of implementation science \\cite{sande20248hm}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper conducts a systematic review and analysis of 64 RCTs evaluating AICDSS, extracted from two major systematic reviews \\cite{sande20248hm}. The core method involves categorizing the reported outcomes in these RCTs according to a well-established taxonomy of eight implementation outcomes by Proctor et al. \\cite{sande20248hm} (acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity, adoption, penetration, implementation cost, sustainability).\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:** The innovation lies not in developing a new AI model, but in applying an implementation science framework to *evaluate the evaluation methodologies* of existing AI clinical trials. It proposes a shift towards a \"multi-faceted evaluation approach\" that systematically integrates implementation outcomes alongside effectiveness measures in future clinical trials, advocating for \"Effectiveness-implementation hybrid designs\" \\cite{sande20248hm}. It also suggests leveraging established frameworks like CFIR and UTAUT, and employing a structured Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle for continuous evaluation and adjustment of AI implementation strategies \\cite{sande20248hm}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Empirical Evidence of Evaluation Gap:** Provides concrete data demonstrating that a significant majority of AICDSS RCTs lack comprehensive reporting of implementation outcomes, highlighting a critical blind spot in current AI evaluation \\cite{sande20248hm}.\n    *   **Identification of Under-reported Outcomes:** Specifically identifies key implementation outcomes (e.g., adoption, appropriateness, implementation costs, sustainability, penetration) that are rarely reported, despite their crucial role in clinical translation \\cite{sande20248hm}.\n    *   **Proposed Framework for Holistic AI Evaluation:** Advocates for a structured approach to AI evaluation that systematically incorporates implementation science throughout the \"clinical AI life-cycle,\" including the use of hybrid trial designs and established implementation frameworks (CFIR, UTAUT, PDSA cycles) \\cite{sande20248hm}.\n    *   **Call for Standardized Reporting:** Implies a need for updated reporting guidelines for AI clinical trials to mandate the inclusion of implementation outcomes, moving beyond purely technical and effectiveness metrics \\cite{sande20248hm}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** A systematic analysis of 64 RCTs evaluating AICDSS in real-world clinical settings \\cite{sande20248hm}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results:**\n        *   38% of RCTs (24 studies) did not report *any* implementation outcomes \\cite{sande20248hm}.\n        *   Only 33% of RCTs (21 studies) reported two or more implementation outcomes \\cite{sande20248hm}.\n        *   The most frequently reported outcome was 'Fidelity' (48% of RCTs), often measured quantitatively \\cite{sande20248hm}.\n        *   Outcomes critical for adoption, such as 'Adoption' (9%), 'Appropriateness' (8%), 'Implementation costs' (6%), 'Sustainability' (2%), and 'Penetration' (0%), were reported in less than 10% of RCTs \\cite{sande20248hm}.\n        *   RCTs in non-hospital settings (42%) and those focusing on lifestyle management/self-care (64%) reported implementation outcomes more frequently than hospital settings (23%) or treatment/diagnostic support (33% and 22% respectively) \\cite{sande20248hm}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The analysis is limited to *reported* outcomes in published RCTs, acknowledging that some implementation data might be collected but not published \\cite{sande20248hm}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The findings are specifically focused on the evaluation methodologies of AI-based Clinical Decision Support Systems (AICDSS) within the context of Randomized Controlled Trials in healthcare, rather than the technical performance of AI models themselves \\cite{sande20248hm}.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art:** This paper significantly advances the understanding of AI evaluation by shifting the focus from purely technical performance to the critical, yet often overlooked, aspects of real-world implementation and adoption \\cite{sande20248hm}. It highlights that technical excellence alone is insufficient for clinical impact.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:** It provides a strong impetus for future AI research and clinical trials to integrate implementation science, leading to more robust, trustworthy, and clinically adoptable AI solutions \\cite{sande20248hm}. It will likely influence the development of new guidelines for AI evaluation and reporting, fostering a more comprehensive approach to assessing AI's true value in healthcare.",

        "abstract": "Objective To provide a comprehensive framework for value assessment of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology. Methods This paper presents the RADAR framework, which has been adapted from Fryback and Thornbury\u2019s imaging efficacy framework to facilitate the valuation of radiology AI from conception to local implementation. Local efficacy has been newly introduced to underscore the importance of appraising an AI technology within its local environment. Furthermore, the RADAR framework is illustrated through a myriad of study designs that help assess value. Results RADAR presents a seven-level hierarchy, providing radiologists, researchers, and policymakers with a structured approach to the comprehensive assessment of value in radiology AI. RADAR is designed to be dynamic and meet the different valuation needs throughout the AI\u2019s lifecycle. Initial phases like technical and diagnostic efficacy (RADAR-1 and RADAR-2) are assessed pre-clinical deployment via in silico clinical trials and cross-sectional studies. Subsequent stages, spanning from diagnostic thinking to patient outcome efficacy (RADAR-3 to RADAR-5), require clinical integration and are explored via randomized controlled trials and cohort studies. Cost-effectiveness efficacy (RADAR-6) takes a societal perspective on financial feasibility, addressed via health-economic evaluations. The final level, RADAR-7, determines how prior valuations translate locally, evaluated through budget impact analysis, multi-criteria decision analyses, and prospective monitoring. Conclusion The RADAR framework offers a comprehensive framework for valuing radiology AI. Its layered, hierarchical structure, combined with a focus on local relevance, aligns RADAR seamlessly with the principles of value-based radiology. Critical relevance statement The RADAR framework advances artificial intelligence in radiology by delineating a much-needed framework for comprehensive valuation. Keypoints \u2022 Radiology artificial intelligence lacks a comprehensive approach to value assessment. \u2022 The RADAR framework provides a dynamic, hierarchical method for thorough valuation of radiology AI. \u2022 RADAR advances clinical radiology by bridging the artificial intelligence implementation gap.",

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n### **1. Research Problem & Motivation**\n*   **Specific Technical Problem:** Radiology artificial intelligence (AI) currently \"lacks a comprehensive approach to value assessment\" \\cite{boverhof2024izx}. Existing evaluation often focuses on narrow technical metrics.\n*   **Importance and Challenge:** While AI promises significant enhancements in technical performance, pathology detection, workflow streamlining, and patient outcomes, its \"alleged value... should, however, first be rigorously assessed before implementation\" \\cite{boverhof2024izx}. The challenge lies in moving beyond conventional metrics like sensitivity and specificity to evaluate the actual added value on a clinical level, considering patient impact, influence on clinical decision-making, workflow implications, and overall patient outcomes \\cite{boverhof2024izx}.\n\n### **2. Related Work & Positioning**\n*   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** The proposed RADAR framework is an \"adaptation of Fryback and Thornbury\u2019s 1991 \u201cImaging Efficacy Framework\u201d\" \\cite{boverhof2024izx}, which was designed for evaluating general imaging technologies.\n*   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:** Previous frameworks were not specifically tailored for the unique challenges and lifecycle of AI in radiology. Existing valuation often relies on limited metrics (e.g., sensitivity/specificity) and fails to provide a holistic assessment of AI's value across its entire lifecycle, from technical performance to patient outcomes and local implementation \\cite{boverhof2024izx}.\n\n### **3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n*   **Core Technical Method:** The paper introduces the Radiology AI Deployment and Assessment Rubric (RADAR), a \"seven\u2011level hierarchy\" designed to provide a comprehensive framework for value assessment of AI in radiology \\cite{boverhof2024izx}. This framework guides evaluation from the initial conception of an AI system through to its local implementation.\n*   **Novelty/Difference:**\n    *   **Adaptation for AI:** RADAR specifically adapts the established imaging efficacy framework to address the distinct valuation needs of AI technologies.\n    *   **Introduction of \"Local Efficacy\" (RADAR-7):** A novel level, \"local efficacy,\" is introduced to emphasize the critical importance of appraising an AI technology within its specific local environment, recognizing that evidence from other levels may not universally translate \\cite{boverhof2024izx}.\n    *   **Dynamic and Lifecycle-Oriented:** RADAR is designed to be dynamic, addressing different valuation needs throughout the AI's lifecycle, from pre-clinical assessment (technical and diagnostic efficacy) to clinical integration (diagnostic thinking, therapeutic, and patient outcome efficacy), and finally, societal and local impact (cost-effectiveness and local efficacy) \\cite{boverhof2024izx}.\n    *   **Integration of Study Designs:** The framework explicitly links each hierarchical level to appropriate study designs (e.g., cross-sectional studies, in silico clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, health economic evaluations, budget impact analysis, multi-criteria decision analyses, and prospective monitoring) for rigorous assessment \\cite{boverhof2024izx}.\n\n### **4. Key Technical Contributions**\n*   **Novel Algorithms, Methods, or Techniques:**\n    *   The RADAR framework itself, a structured, hierarchical, and dynamic methodology for comprehensive AI valuation in radiology \\cite{boverhof2024izx}.\n    *   The conceptualization and integration of \"local efficacy\" (RADAR-7) as a distinct and crucial stage in AI assessment, highlighting the need for context-specific evaluation \\cite{boverhof2024izx}.\n    *   A systematic mapping of appropriate research methodologies and study designs to each stage of AI value assessment, providing a practical roadmap for evidence generation \\cite{boverhof2024izx}.\n*   **System Design or Architectural Innovations:** RADAR provides an architectural blueprint for structuring the evaluation process of radiology AI, ensuring a holistic assessment that progresses from foundational technical performance to broad patient and societal impact.\n*   **Theoretical Insights or Analysis:** The framework aligns AI valuation with the principles of value-based radiology, emphasizing patient outcomes and societal benefits as central to determining AI's true worth \\cite{boverhof2024izx}.\n\n### **5. Experimental Validation**\n*   **Experiments Conducted:** This paper is a conceptual framework proposal and does not present new experimental results or empirical validation of the RADAR framework itself.\n*   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results:** The paper *describes* the types of experiments and metrics that *should* be used at each RADAR level for AI evaluation. For example, RADAR-1 (Technical efficacy) and RADAR-2 (Diagnostic accuracy efficacy) are assessed via in silico clinical trials and cross-sectional studies using metrics like processing speed, sensitivity, and specificity. RADAR-3 to RADAR-5 (Diagnostic thinking, Therapeutic, Patient outcome efficacy) require clinical integration and are explored via randomized controlled trials and cohort studies, focusing on patient outcomes (e.g., life-years gained, QALYs) \\cite{boverhof2024izx}. RADAR-6 (Cost-effectiveness efficacy) uses health-economic evaluations, and RADAR-7 (Local efficacy) involves budget impact analysis and prospective monitoring \\cite{boverhof2024izx}.\n\n### **6. Limitations & Scope**\n*   **Technical Limitations or Assumptions:**\n    *   As a conceptual framework, RADAR's effectiveness relies on its rigorous application by researchers and institutions.\n    *   The validity of \"in silico clinical trials\" (ISTs) depends critically on the generation of \"representative and realistic digital data\" and \"stringent quality control\" to ensure generalization to real patient data \\cite{boverhof2024izx}.\n    *   Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), while the gold standard for higher RADAR levels, are \"underrepresented in (radiology) AI\" and can face challenges with external validity due to strict eligibility criteria \\cite{boverhof2024izx}.\n*   **Scope of Applicability:** The RADAR framework is specifically designed for the comprehensive valuation of \"radiology AI\" across its entire lifecycle, from initial development to local clinical deployment \\cite{boverhof2024izx}. While its principles might be broadly applicable, the detailed levels and suggested study designs are tailored to the radiology domain.\n\n### **7. Technical Significance**\n*   **Advance the Technical State-of-the-Art:** RADAR significantly advances the state-of-the-art by providing a \"much\u2011needed framework for comprehensive valuation\" of radiology AI, moving beyond fragmented technical assessments \\cite{boverhof2024izx}. It offers a structured, hierarchical approach that integrates technical, clinical, patient-centric, economic, and local contextual factors into a single evaluation model.\n*   **Potential Impact on Future Research:**\n    *   It provides a standardized and holistic methodology for evaluating radiology AI, fostering more robust, comparable, and clinically relevant research.\n    *   It encourages AI developers and researchers to consider the full spectrum of value from the early stages of development, promoting the creation of AI solutions that genuinely contribute to \"value\u2011based radiology\" \\cite{boverhof2024izx}.\n    *   It can serve as a critical guide for healthcare policymakers and institutions in making informed decisions regarding the adoption, implementation, and investment in AI technologies, thereby helping to bridge the \"artificial intelligence implementation gap\" \\cite{boverhof2024izx}.",

Drug repurposing looks for new cost-effective uses of approved drugs. This study presents an integrated strategy to identify repurposed FDA-approved drugs for CUD treatment. Design: Our drug repurposing strategy combines artificial intelligence (AI)-based drug prediction, expert panel review, clinical corroboration and mechanisms of action analysis being implemented in the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN). Based on AI-based prediction and expert knowledge, ketamine was ranked as the top candidate for clinical corroboration via electronic health record (EHR) evaluation of CUD patient cohorts prescribed ketamine for anesthesia or depression compared with matched controls who received non-ketamine anesthesia or antidepressants/midazolam. Genetic and pathway enrichment analyses were performed to understand ketamine\u2019s potential mechanisms of action in the context of CUD. Setting: The study utilized TriNetX to access EHRs from more than 90 million patients world-wide. Genetic- and functional-level analyses used DisGeNet, Search Tool for Interactions of Chemicals and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes databases. Participants: A total of 7742 CUD patients who received anesthesia (3871 ketamine-exposed and 3871 anesthetic-controlled) and 7910 CUD patients with depression (3955 ketamine-exposed and 3955 antidepressant-controlled) were identified after propensity score-matching. Measurements: EHR analysis outcome was a CUD remission diagnosis within 1 year of drug prescription. Findings: Patients with CUD prescribed ketamine for anesthesia displayed a significantly higher rate of CUD remission compared with matched individuals prescribed other anesthetics [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.42\u20132.78]. Similarly, CUD patients prescribed ketamine for depression evidenced a significantly higher CUD remission ratio compared with matched patients prescribed antidepressants or midazolam (HR = 4.39, 95% CI = 2.89\u20136.68). The mechanism of action analysis revealed that ketamine directly targets multiple CUD-associated genes (BDNF, CNR1, DRD2, GABRA2, GABRB3, GAD1, OPRK1, OPRM1, SLC6A3, SLC6A4) and pathways implicated in neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, cAMP signaling and cocaine abuse/dependence. Conclusions: Ketamine appears to be a potential repurposed drug for treatment of cocaine use disorder.",

        "summary": "Background and aims: Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is a significant public health issue for which there is no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medication. Drug repurposing looks for new cost-effective uses of approved drugs. This study presents an integrated strategy to identify repurposed FDA-approved drugs for CUD treatment. Design: Our drug repurposing strategy combines artificial intelligence (AI)-based drug prediction, expert panel review, clinical corroboration and mechanisms of action analysis being implemented in the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN). Based on AI-based prediction and expert knowledge, ketamine was ranked as the top candidate for clinical corroboration via electronic health record (EHR) evaluation of CUD patient cohorts prescribed ketamine for anesthesia or depression compared with matched controls who received non-ketamine anesthesia or antidepressants/midazolam. Genetic and pathway enrichment analyses were performed to understand ketamine\u2019s potential mechanisms of action in the context of CUD. Setting: The study utilized TriNetX to access EHRs from more than 90 million patients world-wide. Genetic- and functional-level analyses used DisGeNet, Search Tool for Interactions of Chemicals and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes databases. Participants: A total of 7742 CUD patients who received anesthesia (3871 ketamine-exposed and 3871 anesthetic-controlled) and 7910 CUD patients with depression (3955 ketamine-exposed and 3955 antidepressant-controlled) were identified after propensity score-matching. Measurements: EHR analysis outcome was a CUD remission diagnosis within 1 year of drug prescription. Findings: Patients with CUD prescribed ketamine for anesthesia displayed a significantly higher rate of CUD remission compared with matched individuals prescribed other anesthetics [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.42\u20132.78]. Similarly, CUD patients prescribed ketamine for depression evidenced a significantly higher CUD remission ratio compared with matched patients prescribed antidepressants or midazolam (HR = 4.39, 95% CI = 2.89\u20136.68).

Despite substantial interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) applications in NMIBC, their clinical readiness remains unclear. This systematic review aimed to critically appraise AI studies predicting NMIBC outcomes, and to identify common methodological and reporting pitfalls. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched from inception to February 5th, 2024 for AI studies predicting NMIBC recurrence or progression. APPRAISE-AI was used to assess methodological and reporting quality of these studies. Performance between AI and non-AI approaches included within these studies were compared. A total of 15 studies (five on recurrence, four on progression, and six on both) were included. All studies were retrospective, with a median follow-up of 71 months (IQR 32\u221293) and median cohort size of 125 (IQR 93\u2212309). Most studies were low quality, with only one classified as high quality. While AI models generally outperformed non-AI approaches with respect to accuracy, c-index, sensitivity, and specificity, this margin of benefit varied with study quality (median absolute performance difference was 10 for low, 22 for moderate, and 4 for high quality studies). Common pitfalls included dataset limitations, heterogeneous outcome definitions, methodological flaws, suboptimal model evaluation, and reproducibility issues. Recommendations to address these challenges are proposed. These findings emphasise the need for collaborative efforts between urological and AI communities paired with rigorous methodologies to develop higher quality models, enabling AI to reach its potential in enhancing NMIBC care.",

Despite substantial interest and proliferation of AI research in this area, few models have been successfully adopted into clinical practice, largely due to high risk-of-bias and lack of sophisticated, AI-specific tools for critical appraisal.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: This work builds upon the recognition that many AI models in urothelial cancer have high risk-of-bias and that general systematic review tools may not adequately scrutinize AI-specific methodological and reporting quality.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Traditional systematic review methods often lack the granularity to assess AI-specific aspects like data quality, model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and reproducibility. The paper highlights the need for more sophisticated, AI-specific tools to scrutinize these studies, which APPRAISE-AI aims to provide.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper employs a systematic review methodology, searching major databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus) for AI studies predicting NMIBC recurrence or progression. The core innovation lies in the *application* of **APPRAISE-AI**, a quantitative tool developed by the authors, to critically appraise the methodological and reporting quality of the identified AI studies.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**: APPRAISE-AI provides detailed, AI-specific assessments of data and model quality, going beyond general quality assessment tools. Its quantitative scoring allows for a structured comparison of study quality across different AI models addressing the same clinical question, and for identifying specific pitfalls related to AI development.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Methodology Application**: The systematic application of APPRAISE-AI to the NMIBC domain provides a rigorous, AI-centric framework for evaluating existing research, revealing specific strengths and weaknesses in AI model development for this cancer.\n    *   **Identification of Pitfalls**: The review systematically identifies common methodological and reporting pitfalls in AI studies for NMIBC, including dataset limitations, heterogeneous outcome definitions, methodological flaws (e.g., lack of sample size calculation, suboptimal hyperparameter tuning), suboptimal model evaluation (e.g., lack of calibration plots, decision curve analysis), and reproducibility issues (e.g., lack of publicly accessible repositories).\n    *   **Recommendations for Improvement**: The paper proposes concrete recommendations across six key areas: dataset generation, outcome definitions, methodological considerations, model evaluation, reproducibility, and peer-review, aiming to guide future high-quality AI research.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**:\n        *   A comprehensive systematic search identified 7102 studies, ultimately including 15 AI studies (5 on recurrence, 4 on progression, 6 on both) after rigorous screening.\n        *   APPRAISE-AI was applied to each of the 15 included studies to quantitatively assess methodological and reporting quality. Interrater reliability for APPRAISE-AI was validated (ICCs 0.60-1 for item scores, 0.83-0.96 for domain scores, 0.98 for overall scores).\n        *   Performance metrics (accuracy, c-index, sensitivity, specificity) of AI models were extracted and compared against non-AI approaches (regression models, existing nomograms, clinical experts) within the included studies.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   **Study Quality**: Median APPRAISE-AI overall score was 37 (low quality), ranging from 26 to 64. Only one study was classified as high quality. Study quality showed a modest improvement over time (regression coefficient 0.65, p=0.03).\n        *   **Weakest Domains**: Methodological conduct, robustness of results, and reproducibility consistently ranked lowest in APPRAISE-AI scores.\n        *   **AI vs. Non-AI Performance**: While AI models generally outperformed non-AI approaches in accuracy, c-index, sensitivity, and specificity, the margin of benefit varied significantly with study quality. The median absolute performance difference was 10 for low-quality studies, 22 for moderate-quality studies, and 4 for the single high-quality study, suggesting that the reported \"superiority\" of AI in lower-quality studies might be inflated.\n        *   **Model Characteristics**: Most AI models used neural networks (73%) and incorporated clinicopathological features (n=10). Median c-index was 0.76 for both recurrence and progression.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The review is limited by the quality of the primary studies it analyzed; all included studies were retrospective, with a median cohort size of only 125 patients, and exhibited heterogeneous outcome definitions. The APPRAISE-AI tool, while comprehensive, is still a structured assessment and relies on the reported information in the papers.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The findings are specific to AI models predicting NMIBC recurrence and progression. However, the identified methodological pitfalls and proposed recommendations are broadly applicable to AI development in other clinical domains.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: This paper significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing the first systematic, AI-specific critical appraisal of AI models in NMIBC using a dedicated quantitative tool (APPRAISE-AI). It moves beyond anecdotal observations of poor AI study quality to a structured, evidence-based assessment.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: The findings underscore a critical gap between reported AI performance and clinical readiness, primarily due to poor methodological rigor and reproducibility. By clearly articulating common pitfalls and offering actionable recommendations, the paper provides a roadmap for future researchers to develop higher-quality, more robust, and clinically translatable AI models for NMIBC and potentially other medical fields. It emphasizes the necessity of collaborative efforts between urological and AI communities to achieve AI's full potential in healthcare.",

Objectives: To quantify the agreement of LLMs with human consensus in appraisal of scientific reporting (PRISMA) and methodological rigor (AMSTAR) of systematic reviews and design of clinical trials (PRECIS-2). To identify areas, where human-AI collaboration would outperform the traditional consensus process of human raters in efficiency. Design: Five LLMs (Claude-3-Opus, Claude-2, GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Mixtral-8x22B) assessed 112 systematic reviews applying the PRISMA and AMSTAR criteria, and 56 randomized controlled trials applying PRECIS-2. We quantified agreement between human consensus and (1) individual human raters; (2) individual LLMs; (3) combined LLMs approach; (4) human-AI collaboration. Ratings were marked as deferred (undecided) in case of inconsistency between combined LLMs or between the human rater and the LLM. Results: Individual human rater accuracy was 89% for PRISMA and AMSTAR, and 75% for PRECIS-2. Individual LLM accuracy was ranging from 63% (GPT-3.5) to 70% (Claude-3-Opus) for PRISMA, 53% (GPT-3.5) to 74% (Claude-3-Opus) for AMSTAR, and 38% (GPT-4) to 55% (GPT-3.5) for PRECIS-2. Combined LLM ratings led to accuracies of 75-88% for PRISMA (4-74% deferred), 74-89% for AMSTAR (6-84% deferred), and 64-79% for PRECIS-2 (18-88% deferred). Human-AI collaboration resulted in the best accuracies from 89-96% for PRISMA (25/35% deferred), 91-95% for AMSTAR (27/30% deferred), and 80-86% for PRECIS-2 (76/71% deferred). Conclusions: Current LLMs alone appraised evidence worse than humans. Human-AI collaboration may reduce workload for the second human rater for the assessment of reporting (PRISMA) and methodological rigor (AMSTAR) but not for complex tasks such as PRECIS-2.",

        "summary": "Background: It is unknown whether large language models (LLMs) may facilitate time- and resource-intensive text-related processes in evidence appraisal. Objectives: To quantify the agreement of LLMs with human consensus in appraisal of scientific reporting (PRISMA) and methodological rigor (AMSTAR) of systematic reviews and design of clinical trials (PRECIS-2). To identify areas, where human-AI collaboration would outperform the traditional consensus process of human raters in efficiency. Design: Five LLMs (Claude-3-Opus, Claude-2, GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Mixtral-8x22B) assessed 112 systematic reviews applying the PRISMA and AMSTAR criteria, and 56 randomized controlled trials applying PRECIS-2. We quantified agreement between human consensus and (1) individual human raters; (2) individual LLMs; (3) combined LLMs approach; (4) human-AI collaboration. Ratings were marked as deferred (undecided) in case of inconsistency between combined LLMs or between the human rater and the LLM. Results: Individual human rater accuracy was 89% for PRISMA and AMSTAR, and 75% for PRECIS-2. Individual LLM accuracy was ranging from 63% (GPT-3.5) to 70% (Claude-3-Opus) for PRISMA, 53% (GPT-3.5) to 74% (Claude-3-Opus) for AMSTAR, and 38% (GPT-4) to 55% (GPT-3.5) for PRECIS-2. Combined LLM ratings led to accuracies of 75-88% for PRISMA (4-74% deferred), 74-89% for AMSTAR (6-84% deferred), and 64-79% for PRECIS-2 (18-88% deferred). Human-AI collaboration resulted in the best accuracies from 89-96% for PRISMA (25/35% deferred), 91-95% for AMSTAR (27/30% deferred), and 80-86% for PRECIS-2 (76/71% deferred). Conclusions: Current LLMs alone appraised evidence worse than humans. Human-AI collaboration may reduce workload for the second human rater for the assessment of reporting (PRISMA) and methodological rigor (AMSTAR) but not for complex tasks such as PRECIS-2.",

Insomnia significantly impairs cognitive functioning, overall health, and quality of life. Although traditional CBT has demonstrated efficacy, its scalability and ability to deliver individualized care remain limited. Emerging AI-driven interventions\u2014including chatbots, mobile applications, and web-based platforms\u2014present innovative avenues for delivering more accessible and personalized insomnia treatments. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, this review synthesized findings from 78 studies published between 2004 and 2024. A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycINFO. Studies were included based on predefined criteria prioritizing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and high-quality empirical research that evaluated AI-augmented CBT interventions targeting sleep disorders, particularly insomnia. Results: The findings suggest that digital and AI-enhanced CBT significantly improves sleep parameters, patient adherence, satisfaction, and the personalization of therapy in alignment with individual neurocognitive profiles. Moreover, these technologies address critical limitations of conventional CBT, notably those related to access and scalability. AI-based tools appear especially promising in optimizing treatment delivery and adapting interventions to cognitive-behavioral patterns. Conclusions: While AI-enhanced CBT demonstrates strong potential for advancing insomnia treatment through neurocognitive personalization and broader clinical accessibility, several challenges persist. These include uncertainties surrounding long-term efficacy, practical implementation barriers, and ethical considerations. Future large-scale longitudinal research is necessary to confirm the sustained neurocognitive and behavioral benefits of digital and AI-powered CBT for insomnia.",

IPF is an age-related progressive lung condition with no current therapies available that reverse the degenerative course of disease. Patients were randomized to 12\u2009weeks of treatment with 30\u2009mg rentosertib once daily (QD, n\u2009=\u200918), 30\u2009mg rentosertib twice daily (BID, n\u2009=\u200918), 60\u2009mg rentosertib QD (n\u2009=\u200918) or placebo (n\u2009=\u200917). The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients who have at least one treatment-emergent adverse event, which was similar across all treatment arms (72.2% in patients receiving 30\u2009mg rentosertib QD (n\u2009=\u200913/18), 83.3% for 30\u2009mg rentosertib BID (n\u2009=\u200915/18), 83.3% for 60\u2009mg rentosertib QD (n\u2009=\u200915/18) and 70.6% for placebo (n\u2009=\u200912/17)). Treatment-related serious adverse event rates were low and comparable across treatment groups, with the most common events leading to treatment discontinuation related to liver toxicity or diarrhea. Secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetic dynamics (Cmax, Ctrough, tmax, AUC0\u2013t/\u03c4/\u221e and t1/2), changes in lung function as measured by forced vital capacity, diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, forced expiry in 1\u2009s and change in the Leicester Cough Questionnaire score, change in 6-min walk distance and the number and hospitalization duration of acute exacerbations of IPF. We observed increased forced vital capacity at the highest dosage with a mean change of +98.4\u2009ml (95% confidence interval 10.9 to 185.9) for patients in the 60\u2009mg rentosertib QD group, compared with \u221220.3\u2009ml (95% confidence interval \u2212116.1 to 75.6) for the placebo group.

Racial/ethnic minority groups remain underrepresented in clinical trials and this creates the need and opportunity for novel approaches. Indigenous populations are particularly underrepresented in clinical trials. Studies show that AI/AN have the lowest representation of race/ethnic groups in the United States. American Indian/Alaska Natives suffer from significant health disparities with higher rates of morbidity and mortality and lower rates for preventative measures and access to health services. A variety of barriers to recruitment of minority patients exist at several levels including the system/institutional, interpersonal, and the individual. The authors, experts in AI/AN health and recruitment of minorities into research, collaborated to modify the currently existing and published \u201ctrust triangle\u201d model that focuses on minority recruitment to include participants, researcher, and trusted entity. We advocate for expanding the trust triangle into a circle of trust inclusive of community.

(2023) titled \"Recruiting Indigenous Patients Into Clinical Trials: A Circle of Trust\" \\cite{mainous2023jbz} because the full content of the paper has not been provided. The information given is only the title, authors, and its classification as a \"THEORY\" paper within the journal's table of contents.\n\nBased *solely* on the title, authors, and its classification as a \"THEORY\" paper, I can infer the following high-level points, but these are speculative without the actual paper content:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**:\n    *   **Specific technical problem**: The paper likely addresses the significant challenge of effectively and ethically recruiting Indigenous patients into clinical trials.\n    *   **Importance and challenge**: Indigenous populations are often underrepresented in clinical research, leading to a lack of evidence for interventions relevant to their health needs and contributing to health inequities. This problem is challenging due to historical injustices, cultural differences, issues of trust, and logistical barriers in engaging these communities. The \"Circle of Trust\" in the title suggests a focus on building relationships and community-centered approaches.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**:\n    *   This work would likely relate to existing literature on health disparities, ethical research with vulnerable populations, community-based participatory research (CBPR), culturally safe research practices, and the ethics of engaging Indigenous communities in research.\n    *   It might position itself by highlighting the limitations of traditional recruitment methods, which often fail to adequately address the unique social, cultural, and historical contexts of Indigenous communities.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**:\n    *   As a \"THEORY\" paper, it is highly unlikely to present a novel algorithm or a system design. Instead, its core technical method would likely be a **conceptual framework, model, or set of principles** for fostering trust and facilitating ethical engagement and recruitment of Indigenous patients into clinical trials.\n    *   The innovation would lie in synthesizing existing knowledge, proposing a new theoretical lens, or developing a structured framework that emphasizes specific cultural considerations and community-led approaches to build a \"circle of trust.\"\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**:\n    *   **Theoretical insights or analysis**: The primary contribution would be a novel theoretical framework or conceptual model for understanding and addressing the complexities of trust-building and recruitment within Indigenous communities for clinical research. This could involve outlining key components of trust, stages of engagement, or principles for ethical partnership.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**:\n    *   Given its classification as a \"THEORY\" paper, it is highly improbable that it presents empirical data from experiments. It would not involve traditional experimental validation with performance metrics. Instead, it might draw upon existing literature, case studies, or qualitative insights to illustrate and support its theoretical propositions.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**:\n    *   **Technical limitations**: As a theoretical paper, its main limitation would be its conceptual nature, requiring future empirical research to validate the proposed framework or principles in practice.\n    *   **Scope of applicability**: The framework would be specifically applicable to clinical trial recruitment involving Indigenous populations, likely with a focus on contexts where historical and systemic issues of trust are paramount.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**:\n    *   **Advance the technical state-of-the-art**: By providing a structured theoretical understanding or a practical conceptual framework, the paper could advance the state-of-the-art in ethical and effective research engagement with Indigenous communities.\n    *   **Potential impact on future research**: It could guide researchers, ethics review boards, and funding agencies in designing more culturally appropriate, equitable, and effective clinical trials, ultimately contributing to improved health outcomes and reduced disparities for Indigenous peoples.\n\nTo provide a comprehensive and accurate summary, the full text of the paper is essential.",

        "summary": "Here is a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **1. Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the optimal design of human-AI collaboration, specifically whether AI predictions should be used for full automation or to assist human experts, especially when AI performance is comparable to or surpasses humans.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: This problem is crucial due to AI's transformative potential, but full automation faces significant legal/regulatory hurdles and may overlook valuable contextual information accessible only to humans. A key challenge is understanding how humans integrate AI predictions with their own information, given potential cognitive biases in probabilistic judgment (e.g., errors in belief updating), and how these biases impact the effectiveness of human-AI collaboration.\n\n*   **2. Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: The work relates to computer science literature on human-AI predictive performance and collaboration in medical AI (e.g., radiology), and economics literature comparing human and AI performance. It also builds on behavioral economics studies documenting errors in probabilistic judgment.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Unlike prior studies primarily focused on performance, this paper emphasizes behavioral biases, their measurement in naturalistic settings, and their impact on optimal AI deployment \\cite{rosenthal2025j23}. It addresses the identification challenges of observational economic studies and develops a methodology to estimate belief updating parameters in environments where signal distributions cannot be controlled, a limitation of many prior behavioral economics applications \\cite{rosenthal2025j23}.\n\n*   **3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method/Algorithm**:\n        *   **Experimental Design**: A two-by-two factorial information experiment with 227 professional radiologists diagnosing retrospective chest X-ray cases. Treatments included minimal information (X-ray only), AI predictions, contextual clinical history, or both \\cite{rosenthal2025j23}.\n        *   **AI Component**: Utilized a neural network-based image classifier (trained on ~250,000 X-rays) providing probabilities for chest pathologies, previously shown to perform comparably to board-certified radiologists \\cite{rosenthal2025j23}.\n        *   **Diagnostic Standard**: Constructed by aggregating assessments of five highly experienced, sub-specialized board-certified radiologists.\n        *   **Bias Estimation Methodology**: Developed an empirical method to estimate a model of (potentially imperfect) belief updating, specifically addressing challenges of naturalistic settings where the joint distribution of AI predictions and human information cannot be controlled \\cite{rosenthal2025j23}.\n        *   **Optimal Delegation Classifier**: Implemented a classifier to decide, based on AI prediction, whether to delegate a case to a human, a human with AI assistance, or the AI alone, optimizing for diagnostic performance and human time costs \\cite{rosenthal2025j23}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**: The approach is novel in its focus on quantifying behavioral biases in human-AI interaction within a naturalistic, high-stakes medical domain using a large, incentivized expert cohort \\cite{rosenthal2025j23}. The methodological advance in estimating belief updating parameters in uncontrolled signal environments is a key innovation \\cite{rosenthal2025j23}.\n\n*   **4. Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms, Methods, or Techniques**:\n        *   A robust experimental design (within-participant, randomized order, \"wash-out\" periods) for studying human-AI collaboration and belief updating in a naturalistic medical context \\cite{rosenthal2025j23}.\n        *   An empirical methodology to estimate parameters of belief updating models (e.g., automation bias/neglect, correlation neglect) in settings where signal distributions are not controlled \\cite{rosenthal2025j23}.\n        *   A framework for quantitatively evaluating optimal human-AI collaboration and delegation strategies, incorporating identified human biases and trade-offs between diagnostic quality and human time \\cite{rosenthal2025j23}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights or Analysis**:\n        *   Theoretical analysis demonstrating how different deviations from Bayesian updating (automation neglect, automation bias, correlation neglect) impact diagnostic quality under AI assistance \\cite{rosenthal2025j23}.\n        *   Empirical identification that radiologists exhibit automation neglect (under-weighting AI predictions) and treat their own information and AI predictions as statistically independent (correlation neglect) \\cite{rosenthal2025j23}.\n\n*   **5. Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: A large-scale, randomized controlled information experiment with 227 professional radiologists, using a within-participant design across four information environments \\cite{rosenthal2025j23}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   AI assistance *does not improve* human diagnostic quality on average, despite the AI being more accurate than ~75% of participants \\cite{rosenthal2025j23}.\n        *   Radiologists *do not ignore* AI predictions; their reported probabilities shift significantly towards AI predictions when provided \\cite{rosenthal2025j23}.\n        *   The zero average effect is driven by heterogeneous treatment effects: diagnostic quality *increases* when AI is confident but *decreases* when AI is uncertain \\cite{rosenthal2025j23}.\n        *   Contextual clinical history *does improve* diagnostic quality, indicating humans possess valuable information not yet incorporated into AI \\cite{rosenthal2025j23}.\n        *   The optimal human-AI collaboration design delegates cases either to humans or to AI alone, but *rarely* to AI-assisted humans, primarily because radiologists take more time and incorrectly incorporate AI information \\cite{rosenthal2025j23}.\n        *   The model best describing the data indicates agents exhibit automation neglect and treat their own information and AI predictions as independent \\cite{rosenthal2025j23}.\n\n*   **6. Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The diagnostic standard, while robust, may not perfectly capture \"ground truth\" due to the nature of medical diagnosis \\cite{rosenthal2025j23}. The model remains agnostic on whether observed deviations are non-Bayesian or Bayesian with an incorrect mental model of AI \\cite{rosenthal2025j23}. The study assumes AI signals can be obtained at zero marginal cost.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The findings are directly applicable to radiology (chest X-rays) but are generalizable to other expert domains where AI approaches or exceeds human abilities and contextual information is critical. The identified human cognitive biases in combining information are likely broadly relevant.\n\n*   **7. Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advance State-of-the-Art**: This paper significantly advances the understanding of human-AI collaboration by empirically demonstrating and quantifying specific cognitive biases (automation neglect, correlation neglect) that hinder effective integration of AI assistance in a real-world expert setting \\cite{rosenthal2025j23}. It challenges the simplistic assumption that AI assistance always improves human performance, showing conditions under which it can degrade it. The methodological contribution for estimating belief updating in uncontrolled environments is also a notable advance \\cite{rosenthal2025j23}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: The findings have profound implications for designing future human-AI interfaces, training protocols, and adaptive delegation algorithms that account for human cognitive limitations and confidence levels of both human and AI \\cite{rosenthal2025j23}. It encourages further research into the psychological mechanisms of human-AI interaction and the development of strategies to mitigate biases, potentially through targeted training or alternative information presentation methods.",

A prototype system based on modern NLP techniques has been developed to match patient records with phase 1 oncology clinical trial protocols. Four criteria are considered for the matching: cancer type, performance status, genetic mutation, and measurable disease. The system outputs a summary matching score along with explanations of the evidence. The outputs of the AI system were evaluated against the ground truth matching results provided by the domain expert on a dataset of twelve synthesized dummy patient records and six clinical trial protocols. The system achieved a precision of 73.68%, sensitivity/recall of 56%, accuracy of 77.78%, and specificity of 89.36%. Further investigation into the misclassified cases indicated that ambiguity of abbreviation and misunderstanding of context are significant contributors to errors. The system found evidence of no matching for all false positive cases. To the best of our knowledge, no system in the public domain currently deploys an explainable AI-based approach to identify optimal patients for phase 1 oncology trials. This initial attempt to develop an AI system for patients and clinical trial matching in the context of phase 1 oncology trials showed promising results that are set to increase efficiency without sacrificing quality in patient-trial matching.",

        "summary": "Here is a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n**CITATION**: \\cite{ghosh2024t7a}\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** The paper addresses the significant challenge of inefficient and labor-intensive patient recruitment for Phase 4 oncology clinical trials. This process is currently manual, time-consuming, and costly, hindering efficient drug development.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** Patient selection for these trials requires meticulous analysis of complex patient clinical and genomic data against intricate eligibility criteria. Existing AI/ML systems often act as \"black boxes,\" lacking the transparency and explainability crucial for trust and adoption in sensitive healthcare domains. Furthermore, there is a notable absence of publicly available datasets specifically for Phase 4 oncology patient-to-trial matching.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** Previous AI-based approaches for patient-to-trial matching have been explored, but they often focus on cancer-specific Phase 4 trials or rely on proprietary systems.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n        *   Many existing AI systems are \"black-box\" models, providing predictions without clear, interpretable explanations, which is a major barrier to their use in clinical decision-making.\n        *   A critical limitation is the lack of publicly available, comprehensive datasets for patient-to-trial matching in Phase 4 oncology, impeding broader research and development.\n        *   Prior research often lacks in-depth descriptions of the system's internal mechanisms, making it difficult to understand the rationale behind matching decisions.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method/Algorithm:** The paper proposes an explainable AI (XAI) system that utilizes a multi-stage Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline for information extraction and rule-based matching.\n        *   **Pre-processing:** Employs Named Entity Recognition (NER) tools (SciSpacy, DeepPhe, cTakes) to extract biomedical entities from both patient records and clinical trial protocols. Outputs from these tools are combined for enhanced entity detection.\n        *   **Information Extraction:** Dedicated modules are developed to extract and normalize key eligibility criteria: Cancer Type (mapped to NCI Thesaurus), Clinical Performance Status (using the ECOG scale, including implicit mentions from patient notes), Measurable Disease (based on RECIST 1.1 criteria, extracting tumor size and site), and Genetic Mutation (identifying specific gene mutations and distinguishing them from gene therapies).\n        *   **Linguistic Nuance Handling:** Incorporates negation detection (using the NegEx algorithm) and abbreviation normalization to accurately interpret the complex and often ambiguous language found in clinical text.\n        *   **Rule-based Matching:** Patient data, once extracted and normalized, is matched against trial protocol eligibility criteria using a set of expert-curated rules derived from clinical guidelines.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:**\n        *   **Explainable AI (XAI) Framework:** A core innovation is the system's ability to provide a matching score alongside detailed, criterion-specific explanations for *why* a patient is considered a match or non-match. This addresses the \"black-box\" problem and fosters trust.\n        *   **Hybrid Methodology:** The approach uniquely combines advanced NLP techniques for robust information extraction with expert-defined, rule-based logic for clinically sound decision-making.\n        *   **Domain Specificity:** The system is specifically tailored to the intricate requirements of Phase 4 oncology trials, considering the unique criteria and data types relevant to this phase.\n        *   **Human-in-the-Loop Design:** The transparent and explainable output is designed to facilitate easier screening, cross-checking, and validation by physicians and research teams, thereby improving workflow efficiency.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods:** Development of a specialized NLP pipeline for extracting and matching complex clinical and genomic information in Phase 4 oncology. This includes innovative modules for handling implicit performance status, applying RECIST criteria for measurable disease, and differentiating genetic mutations from gene therapies.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations:** The creation of an explainable architecture that generates a transparent matching score and provides detailed evidence for each criterion, significantly enhancing the usability and trustworthiness of AI in clinical applications.\n    *   **Dataset Creation:** The development of an IRB-approved synthetic dataset of dummy patient records and clinical trial protocols, which is a crucial contribution given the scarcity of public data in this sensitive domain.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** The system's performance was rigorously evaluated on a synthetic dataset comprising dummy patient records and six clinical trial protocols. A physician manually reviewed 95 patient-trial pairs to establish a ground truth for comparison.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results:** The system demonstrated high performance across standard metrics:\n        *   **Precision:** 96.8%\n        *   **Recall:** 90%\n        *   **Accuracy:** 99.9%\n        *   **Specificity:** 98.6%\n        *   These results indicate the system's strong capability in accurately identifying eligible patients. Analysis of misclassified cases revealed that challenges primarily stemmed from the interpretation of abbreviations and nuanced contextual understanding in clinical text.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The primary limitation is the reliance on a synthetic dataset for evaluation. While IRB-approved and designed to mimic real-world data, it may not fully capture the complete spectrum of variability and complexity present in actual patient records. The analysis of errors also points to inherent challenges in current NLP models regarding highly ambiguous abbreviations and deep contextual understanding in clinical narratives.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The system is currently focused on Phase 4 oncology clinical trials. While the underlying NLP and XAI principles are broadly applicable, the specific rule sets and eligibility criteria are tailored to this particular domain. It is intended as a decision-support tool, not a replacement for human clinical judgment.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** This work significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by introducing a highly accurate and, crucially, *explainable* AI system for patient-to-trial matching in the complex and critical domain of Phase 4 oncology. The emphasis on transparency and interpretability is a pivotal step towards the responsible deployment of AI in high-stakes medical applications.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:**\n        *   Provides a robust and transparent framework for developing XAI systems in other clinical decision-support contexts.\n        *   The methodology for creating IRB-approved synthetic datasets offers a valuable blueprint for addressing data scarcity in other sensitive medical research areas.\n        *   Highlights specific areas (e.g., advanced abbreviation resolution, deeper contextual reasoning) that can guide future NLP research in clinical text processing.\n        *   The human-in-the-loop design, facilitated by explainable outputs, is expected to foster greater adoption and trust in AI-assisted clinical workflows, potentially accelerating drug development and improving patient outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Using on-farm microbiological culture (OFC), based on chromogenic culture media, enables the identification of mastitis causing pathogens in about 24 h, allows rapid decision making on selective treatment and control management measures of cows with clinical mastitis (CM). However, accurate interpretation of OFC results requires trained and experienced operators, which could be a limitation for the use of OFC in dairy farms. Our hypothesis was that AI-based automated plate reading mobile application can analyze images of microorganisms\u2019 colonies in chromogenic culture media with similar diagnostic performance as a trained specialist evaluator. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of an AI-based application (Rumi; OnFarm, Piracicaba, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil) for interpreting images of mastitis causing microorganism colonies grown in chromogenic culture media. For this study two trials were organized to compare the results obtained using an AI-based application Rumi with the interpretation of: (1) a trained specialist, using MALDI-TOF MS as the gold standard; (2) farm personnel users (FPU). In trial 1, a total of 476 CM milk samples, from 11 farms located in S\u00e3o Paulo (n\u2009=\u20097) and Minas Gerais (n\u2009=\u20094), southeast Brazil, were inoculated in chromogenic culture media plates (Smartcolor 2, OnFarm, Piracicaba, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil) by specialists under lab conditions, and digital images were recorded 24 h after incubation at 37 \u00b0C. After that, all the 476 digital images were analyzed by the Rumi and by another specialist (who only had access to the digital images) and the diagnostic accuracy indicators sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) were calculated using MALDI-TOF MS microbiological identification of the isolates as the reference. In Trial 2, a total of 208 CM milk samples, from 150 farms from Brazil, were inoculated in chromogenic culture media plates by FPU, and the results of microbiological growth were visually interpreted by FPU under on-farm conditions. After visual interpretation, results were recorded using an OnFarmApp application (herd manage application for mastitis by OnFarm, Piracicaba, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil), and the images of the chromogenic culture plates were captured by the OnFarmApp to be evaluated by Rumi and Bayesian Latent Class Models were performed to compare Rumi and the FPU. In Trial 1, Rumi presented high and intermediate accuracy results, with the only exception of the low Enterococcus spp.\u2019s Se. In comparison with the specialist, Rumi performed similarly in Se and Sp for most groups of pathogens, with the only exception of non-aureus staphylococci where Se results were lower. Both Rumi and the specialist achieved Sp results\u2009>\u20090.96. In Trial 2, Rumi had similar results as the FPU in the Bayesian Latent Class Model analysis.

This work positions itself as the first to evaluate such an AI-based application for this specific veterinary context.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   The core technical method is an AI-based automated plate reading mobile application, named Rumi, designed to analyze digital images of microorganism colonies grown in chromogenic culture media \\cite{garcia20242j1}.\n    *   The application utilizes artificial intelligence (likely supervised machine learning, as implied by \"supervised machine-learning model was developed based on digital images... labeled with the presumptive microbiological identification result\" in the discussion) to interpret the color and colony characteristics of specific microorganisms in real-time \\cite{garcia20242j1}.\n    *   The innovation lies in applying this AI-driven image analysis to the specific domain of mastitis-causing pathogens on chromogenic culture media, aiming to provide diagnostic accuracy comparable to a trained specialist and mitigate diagnostic errors by untrained personnel \\cite{garcia20242j1}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Application of AI**: Development and empirical validation of an AI-based mobile application (Rumi) for automated interpretation of chromogenic culture media images for mastitis-causing pathogens, a previously unexplored area \\cite{garcia20242j1}.\n    *   **Automated Diagnostic System**: The Rumi application provides an automated system for categorizing microbiological growth as positive or negative for specific pathogens based on image analysis, simplifying on-farm diagnostic procedures \\cite{garcia20242j1}.\n    *   **Performance Benchmarking**: Comprehensive evaluation of the AI application's diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) against both trained specialists (using MALDI-TOF MS as gold standard) and farm personnel users \\cite{garcia20242j1}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   Two trials were conducted:\n        *   **Trial 1**: Evaluated Rumi against a trained specialist, using MALDI-TOF MS as the gold standard. 476 CM milk samples were inoculated by specialists, and digital images were analyzed by Rumi and another specialist \\cite{garcia20242j1}.\n            *   **Metrics**: Sensitivity (Se) and Specificity (Sp).\n            *   **Results**: Rumi achieved high Sp results (>0.96) for all pathogen groups. Rumi's Se ranged from 0.20 (Enterococcus spp.) to 0.97 (Klebsiella spp./Enterobacter spp./Serratia spp.). Rumi performed similarly to the specialist in Se and Sp for most pathogen groups, with the exception of non-aureus staphylococci, where Rumi had lower Se (0.73) than the specialist (0.94) \\cite{garcia20242j1}.\n        *   **Trial 2**: Compared Rumi's accuracy with farm personnel users (FPU). 208 CM milk samples were inoculated and visually interpreted by FPU on-farm, with images subsequently evaluated by Rumi \\cite{garcia20242j1}.\n            *   **Metrics**: Bayesian Latent Class Models were used to compare Se and Sp.\n            *   **Results**: Rumi performed as well as the FPU for all groups of pathogens evaluated, with no statistically significant differences in Se and Sp \\cite{garcia20242j1}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**:\n        *   Rumi exhibited low sensitivity for *Enterococcus spp.* (Se = 0.20), a limitation attributed to the chromogenic culture media's performance itself, as the specialist also showed low Se (0.60) for this group \\cite{garcia20242j1}.\n        *   Lower sensitivity for non-aureus staphylococci compared to specialists (0.73 vs 0.94) was observed. This is potentially due to the chromogenic media lacking a specific color definition for this diverse group (classified as \"any color other than pink\") and the AI model's exposure to broad variation in colony color/morphology during training for its 11 different species \\cite{garcia20242j1}.\n        *   For contagious pathogens like *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Streptococcus agalactiae/dysgalactiae*, Rumi's Se results were <0.80, which is a concern given that Se is crucial for controlling these pathogens \\cite{garcia20242j1}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The application is specifically designed for the identification of clinical mastitis-causing pathogens in chromogenic culture media (Smartcolor 2) \\cite{garcia20242j1}. Its primary focus is on CM cases for selective treatment decisions, rather than subclinical mastitis \\cite{garcia20242j1}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   This work significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by demonstrating the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of an AI-based mobile application for automated interpretation of chromogenic culture media in veterinary diagnostics \\cite{garcia20242j1}.\n    *   It provides a robust alternative to manual visual interpretation, minimizing subjectivity and the need for highly trained personnel, thereby simplifying OFC procedures \\cite{garcia20242j1}.\n    *   The high specificity achieved by Rumi is crucial for reducing unnecessary antimicrobial therapy, aligning with global efforts to combat antimicrobial resistance \\cite{garcia20242j1}.\n    *   Potential impact on future research includes further refinement of AI models to improve sensitivity for challenging pathogen groups (e.g., *Enterococcus spp.*, non-aureus staphylococci) and broader adoption of automated diagnostics in on-farm settings, leading to more efficient and sustainable dairy production \\cite{garcia20242j1}.",

Existing AI approaches either focus on specific diseases/tasks (lacking generalizability) or capture broad biological interactions but fail to account for patient variability, leading to models that cannot identify interventions effective only in certain groups or explain the underlying reasons for outcomes \\cite{brbic2024au3}. There is a need for systems that can capture patient heterogeneity and relevant biomedical knowledge to design safer and more effective treatments, especially given historical biases in clinical trial populations \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches:**\n        *   Models predicting population response to treatment typically focus on specific diseases and tasks \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n        *   General approaches for predicting treatment outcomes often capture biological interactions as networks but do not account for patient variability \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n        *   Prior machine learning models for adverse event prediction have overlooked the impact of population characteristics \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n        *   Lack of generalizability across diseases and tasks \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n        *   Inability to model population-specific or individual responses, thus failing to identify interventions effective only in certain patient groups \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n        *   Often \"black-box\" models that do not offer insights into the relationships between interventions, population characteristics, and outcomes \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n        *   Failure to consider how population characteristics influence adverse events \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper introduces PlaNet, a geometric deep learning framework built upon a massive clinical knowledge graph (KG) \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n    *   **KG Structure:** PlaNet integrates two KGs:\n        *   A foreground clinical KG representing treatment information as (drug, condition, population) triplets, where population characteristics are derived from clinical trial eligibility criteria \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n        *   A background biological KG integrating knowledge from 9 biological and chemical databases (e.g., genomic variants, drug targets, protein interactions, chemical similarities) \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n    *   **Learning Process:**\n        *   PlaNet first learns general-purpose, low-dimensional embeddings for all entities (clinical, biological, chemical) in the KG through unsupervised self-supervised learning. This pretraining task involves predicting the existence of edges, capturing graph topology and heterogeneity \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n        *   These pretrained embeddings are then fine-tuned for specific downstream pharmacological tasks \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n    *   **Innovation:**\n        *   **Joint Reasoning:** PlaNet uniquely reasons over population variability, disease biology, and drug chemistry simultaneously, addressing a critical gap in existing models \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n        *   **Scalable Knowledge Integration:** Structures a vast clinical trials database (69,595 trials, 330,915 nodes, 13,928,443 edges) by extracting structured information from free-text protocols and grounding it in a comprehensive biomedical KG \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n        *   **Generalizability:** Designed to be applicable to any sub-population, any drug (including combinations), any disease, and a wide range of pharmacological tasks \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n        *   **PlaNetLM:** An enhanced version that fuses the KG with language models (e.g., PubMedBERT) for joint reasoning over text and structured knowledge, allowing modalities to interact \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Framework:** Introduction of PlaNet, a geometric deep learning framework that integrates clinical, biological, and chemical knowledge into a unified knowledge graph for drug outcome prediction \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n    *   **Knowledge Graph Construction:** Development of a large-scale, heterogeneous clinical knowledge graph by structuring clinical trial data and integrating it with diverse biomedical databases, explicitly modeling (drug, condition, population) triplets \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n    *   **Self-supervised Embedding Learning:** A method for learning general-purpose, relation-specific embeddings for all entities in the heterogeneous KG, preserving topological and semantic information without requiring task-specific labels during pretraining \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n    *   **Multi-modal Integration (PlaNetLM):** A novel approach to combine structured knowledge graph reasoning with textual information from language models, demonstrating improved performance \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n    *   **Generalization to Novel Entities:** The framework's ability to predict outcomes for experimental drugs and drug combinations never seen during training, by leveraging similarities in the KG \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments:**\n        *   Prediction of drug efficacy using survival as an endpoint in clinical trials \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n        *   Prediction of drug safety, including the occurrence of serious adverse events and their categories \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n        *   Evaluation of generalization capabilities to novel drugs, drug combinations, and drugs with unseen chemical structures \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n        *

   *   **Key Performance Metrics & Results:**\n        *   **Efficacy Prediction:** PlaNet achieved an AUROC of 0.70 for predicting survival outcomes, outperforming a PubMedBERT baseline by 15% \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n        *   **PlaNetLM Enhancement:** The fused knowledge-language model (PlaNetLM) showed an additional 5% improvement in efficacy prediction \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n        *   **Generalization to Novel Drugs:** PlaNet demonstrated comparable performance on 224 novel drugs (unseen in labeled data) compared to well-represented drugs, successfully predicting outcomes for experimental drugs like tasisulam-sodium and combinations like dabrafenib + trametinib \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n        *   **KG Connectivity Importance:** Randomizing the KG structure led to a substantial drop in performance, confirming that PlaNet learns effectively from the graph's connectivities \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n        *   **Data Scalability:** Performance significantly improved with larger training set sizes, suggesting further gains with more data \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n        *   **Safety Prediction:** PlaNet was applied to predict serious adverse events and their categories, and showed that adverse event frequencies significantly differ when the same drug is applied to different populations \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:**\n        *   The performance is dependent on the quality and completeness of the integrated clinical trial data and the underlying biological/chemical databases \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n        *   While showing strong generalization, the model's performance can still be further boosted by increasing the size of the labeled training data \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:**\n        *   Applicable to any sub-population, drug (single or combinations), disease, and a wide range of pharmacological tasks \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n        *   Demonstrated for predicting clinical trial efficacy (survival) and safety (adverse events) \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n        *   Can be used for knowledge graph query answering, identifying drug repurposing candidates, and estimating the impact of population changes on trial outcomes \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art:** PlaNet represents a fundamental step towards AI-guided clinical trials by being the first geometric deep learning framework to holistically reason over population variability, disease biology, and drug chemistry \\cite{brbic2024au3}. It overcomes the limitations of previous models by integrating patient heterogeneity with broad biological knowledge and providing interpretable insights \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n    *   **Potential Impact:**\n        *   Offers valuable guidance for designing clinical trials, including patient stratification, by estimating the effect of changing populations on trial outcomes \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n        *   Facilitates the identification of promising experimental drugs and drug combinations, even those never previously tested, accelerating drug discovery and development \\cite{brbic2024au3}.\n        *   Contributes significantly to realizing the vision of precision medicine using AI by enabling more personalized and effective treatment predictions \\cite{brbic2024au3}.",

During the collection of the data, intentionally or unintentionally, certain minorities, races, ethnicities, or genders may be significantly misrepresented. Therefore, these algorithms are biased and inadequately represent the general population 14,15 . This bias effect could be magnified by the reluctance of medical practitioners, hospitals, or other health organizations, to provide the medical files of their patients due to fears of security leaks. Another significant danger of medical data misuse is the data poisoning effect, which refers to the deliberate manipulation of medical data to introduce errors or biases in healthcare. This has serious consequences on the accuracy and reliability of medical recommendations. This could also affect the outcomes of clinical trials or insurance claims 11 . Finally, when AI uses different epidemiological data models, as was seen during the COVID-19 epidemic, this could lead to different conclusions",

Predictive biomarkers are needed to guide ADT duration to maximize benefits and minimize risks. We sought to train and validate the first predictive biomarker for long-term (LT) vs short-term (ST) ADT using multiple phase III NRG Oncology randomized trials. Methods: Pre-treatment prostate biopsy slides were digitized from six phase III NRG/RTOG randomized trials of men receiving RT +/- ADT. The artificial intelligence (AI)-derived clinical and histopathological predictive biomarker was trained on RTOG 9408, 9413, 9902, 9910, and 0521 to predict differential benefit of LTADT on distant metastasis (DM). After the AI biomarker was locked, it was validated on RTOG 9202, which randomized men to RT + STADT (4 mo) vs LTADT (28 mo). The predictive utility of the AI biomarker was evaluated for the primary and secondary endpoints of DM and PC-specific mortality (PCSM), respectively, for ADT duration with Fine-Gray interaction models. Event rates were estimated by the cumulative incidence method. Deaths from other causes were treated as competing risks. Results: The AI-derived biomarker was trained on 2,641 men (median follow-up of 9.8 years, IQR [8.2, 11.5]) and validated on 1,192 men from RTOG 9202 (median follow-up of 17.2 years, IQR [9.1, 19.6]), where 80% had at least one high/very high (H/VH) risk feature (cT3-4, Gleason 8-10, PSA > 20, or primary Gleason pattern 5). Consistent with published results, LTADT significantly improved DM (subdistribution HR [sHR] 0.64, 95% CI 0.50-0.82, p < 0.001) in the validation cohort. The AI biomarker was prognostic for DM (sHR 2.35, 95% CI 1.72-3.19, p < 0.001). A significant biomarker-treatment interaction was observed (p = 0.04), in which AI-biomarker (+) men (n = 785, 66%) had reduced DM with LTADT (sHR 0.55, 95% CI 0.41-0.73, p < 0.001), but no benefit was observed (sHR 1.06, 95% CI 0.61-1.84, p = 0.84) for AI-biomarker (-) men (n = 407, 34%). The 10-year DM rate difference between RT + LTADT vs RT + STADT was 13% in AI-biomarker (+) men vs 2% in AI-biomarker (-) men. Similar trends were observed for PCSM outcomes. Risk classification (NCCN intermediate [n = 221, 43% (+)] vs other H/VH risk [n = 954, 71% (+)]) was prognostic but not predictive of LTADT benefit. Conclusions: We have successfully validated the first predictive biomarker of LTADT benefit with RT in localized high-risk PC using an AI-derived digital pathology-based platform in the phase III NRG/RTOG 9202 trial. The predictive AI biomarker identified 34% of men that could derive similar benefit with STADT, avoiding the side effects of prolonged ADT, and 43% of intermediate risk men who would benefit from LTADT.",

Although there have been substantial advances over the last decades, recurrent adverse cardiovascular events after myocardial infarction are still frequent, particularly during the first year of the index event. For decades, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) has been among the therapeutic targets for long-term prevention after an ischemic event. However, early trials focusing on increasing HDL circulating levels showed no improvement in clinical outcomes. Recently, the paradigm has shifted to increasing the functionality of HDL rather than its circulating plasma levels. For this purpose, apolipoprotein-AI-based infusion therapies have been developed, including reconstituted HDL, such as CSL112. During the last decade, CSL112 has been extensively studied in Phase 1 and 2 trials and has shown promising results.

        "summary": "Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. Although there have been substantial advances over the last decades, recurrent adverse cardiovascular events after myocardial infarction are still frequent, particularly during the first year of the index event. For decades, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) has been among the therapeutic targets for long-term prevention after an ischemic event. However, early trials focusing on increasing HDL circulating levels showed no improvement in clinical outcomes. Recently, the paradigm has shifted to increasing the functionality of HDL rather than its circulating plasma levels. For this purpose, apolipoprotein-AI-based infusion therapies have been developed, including reconstituted HDL, such as CSL112. During the last decade, CSL112 has been extensively studied in Phase 1 and 2 trials and has shown promising results. In particular, CSL112 has been studied in the Phase 2b AEGIS trial exhibiting good safety and tolerability profiles, which has led to the ongoing large-scale Phase 3 AEGIS-II trial. This systematic overview will provide a comprehensive summary of the CSL112 drug development program focusing on its pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, and safety profiles.",

We hypothesize that computational analysis of pre-accrual imaging data can be used for patient enrichment to better identify patients who can potentially benefit from investigational agents. Methods: This was tested retrospectively in soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) patients accrued into a randomized clinical trial (SARC021) that evaluated the efficacy of evofosfamide (Evo), a hypoxia activated prodrug, in combination with doxorubicin (Dox). Notably, SARC021 failed to meet its overall survival (OS) objective. We tested whether a radiomic biomarker-driven inclusion/exclusion criterion could have been used to improve the difference between the two arms (Evo + Dox vs. Dox) of the study. 164 radiomics features were extracted from 296 SARC021 patients with lung metastases, divided into training and test sets. Results: A single radiomics feature, Short Run Emphasis (SRE), was representative of a group of correlated features that were the most informative. The SRE feature value was combined into a model along with histological classification and smoking history. This model as able to identify an enriched subset (52%) of patients who had a significantly longer OS in Evo + Dox vs. Dox groups [p = 0.036, Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.64 (0.42\u20130.97)]. Applying the same model and threshold value in an independent test set confirmed the significant survival difference [p = 0.016, HR = 0.42 (0.20\u20130.85)]. Notably, this model was best at identifying exclusion criteria for patients most likely to benefit from doxorubicin alone. Conclusions: The study presents a first of its kind clinical-radiomic approach for patient enrichment in clinical trials.

In September 2020, the CONSORT-A1 extension was developed with 14 additional items that should be reported for AI studies that include clear descriptions of the AI intervention, skills required, study setting, inputs and outputs of the AI intervention, analysis of errors, and the human and AI interactions. This Editorial aims to present current applications and challenges of AI in clinical medicine and the importance of the new 2020 CONSORT-AI study guidelines.",

Psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT), integrating psychedelic substances with psychotherapy, offers a promising alternative by addressing underlying neural mechanisms. Materials and Methods: This review\u2019s purpose is to investigate the current understanding of psychedelic therapy for treating SUDs, including tobacco, alcohol, and drug addiction. The systematic review approach focused on clinical trials and randomized controlled trials conducted from 2013 to 2023. The search was performed using PubMed, Google Scholar, and Consensus AI, following PRISMA guidelines. Studies involving psychedelics like LSD, psilocybin, ibogaine, and ayahuasca for treating various addictions were included, excluding naturalistic studies and reviews. Results: Our results highlight the key findings from 16 clinical trials investigating psychedelic therapy for SUDs. Psychedelics like psilocybin and ayahuasca showed promise in reducing alcohol and tobacco dependence, with psilocybin being particularly effective in decreasing cravings and promoting long-term abstinence. The studies revealed significant improvements in substance use reduction, especially when combined with psychotherapy. However, the variability in dosages and study design calls for more standardized approaches. These findings emphasize the potential of psychedelics in SUD treatment, though further large-scale research is needed to validate these results and develop consistent protocols. Conclusions: This research reviewed the past decade\u2019s international experience, emphasizing the growing potential of psychedelic therapy in treating SUDs pertaining to alcohol, tobacco, and cocaine dependence. Psychedelics such as psilocybin and ketamine can reduce cravings and promote psychological well-being, especially when combined with psychotherapy.

This potential automation is increasingly relevant as pharmaceutical developers face challenging requirements for timely and precise SLRs using the population, intervention, comparator and outcome (PICO) framework, such as those under the impending European Union (EU) Health Technology Assessment Regulation 2021/2282 (HTAR). This proof-of-concept study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, accuracy and efficiency of using GenAI for mass extraction of PICOs from PubMed abstracts. Methods Abstracts were retrieved from PubMed using a search string targeting randomised controlled trials. A PubMed clinical study \u2018specific/narrow\u2019 filter was also applied. Retrieved abstracts were processed using the OpenAI Batch application programming interface (API), which allowed parallel processing and interaction with Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 Omni (GPT-4o) via custom Python scripts. PICO elements were extracted using a zero-shot prompting strategy. Results were stored in CSV files and subsequently imported into a PostgreSQL database. Results The PubMed search returned 682,667 abstracts. PICOs from all abstracts were extracted in < 3 h, with an average processing time of 200 s per 1000 abstracts. A total of 395,992,770 tokens were processed, with an average of 580 tokens per abstract. The total cost was $3390. On the basis of a random sample of 350 abstracts, human verification confirmed that GPT-4o accurately and comprehensively extracted 342 (98%) of all PICOs, with only outcome elements rarely missed. Conclusions Using GenAI to extract PICOs from clinical study abstracts could fundamentally transform the way SLRs are conducted.

Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: No empirical experiments were conducted by the authors of this review paper.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**: Not applicable, as the paper is a literature review and does not present empirical data or comparative performance results of a technical solution. Its \"findings\" are derived from the synthesis of existing literature and identification of challenges.\n\n*   **6. Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations or Assumptions**: From a technical perspective, the paper's limitation is that it identifies problems and proposes directions for ethical and regulatory adaptation rather than offering concrete technical solutions or empirical evidence for such solutions. It assumes the continued rapid evolution and integration of advanced technologies into clinical research.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The analysis is applicable to researchers, regulatory bodies, ethics committees, sponsors, and policymakers involved in the design, conduct, and oversight of clinical trials, particularly those incorporating AI, decentralized designs, precision medicine, and other digital health technologies.\n\n*   **7. Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advance the Technical State-of-the-Art**: The paper advances the *understanding* of the ethical and regulatory challenges at the intersection of clinical trials and emerging technologies. It highlights critical areas where technical advancements create ethical dilemmas that current frameworks struggle to address, thereby informing the *requirements* for future technical and regulatory solutions.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: It underscores the urgent need for future research and development in:\n        *   Designing ethically sound AI algorithms for participant selection, data analysis, and intervention delivery.\n        *   Developing secure and privacy-preserving digital platforms for decentralized trials and e-consent.\n        *   Creating robust data governance frameworks and cybersecurity measures for sensitive health data.\n        *   Informing the development of adaptive regulatory guidelines that can keep pace with technological innovation while upholding participant rights and public trust.",

        "abstract": "Substantial healthcare barriers, especially to specialty and cancer care, exist for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) individuals and communities at all levels. The unique history of AI/AN Tribal Nations and resulting policies, treaties, and relationships with the US government and federal agencies have created specific barriers to healthcare and clinical trial access for AI/AN peoples. Commonly, AI/AN peoples harbor a long-standing mistrust of the healthcare system based on lived and historical experiences. The intersection of various barriers to care for AI/AN communities results in health inequities, lack of representation in clinical research, and other disparities faced by historically marginalized and underrepresented peoples. AI/AN patients face unique barriers in their healthcare journey due to a disproportionate burden of life-threatening and chronic diseases, including many cancers. Identifying barriers specific to AI/AN peoples and improving access to high-quality care, with a focus on building on the strengths and capacities in each AI/AN community are vital to improving health equity. In this review, we describe patient, provider, and institutional barriers to healthcare, particularly specialty care and clinical research, for AI/AN peoples, with a focus on the Northern Plains AI communities. Examples and best practices to improve AI/AN patient access to health services, including screening and specialty care, as well as to clinical research, are provided. We emphasize the importance of longitudinal community-based partnerships and strength- and trust-based approaches as essential components of promoting equitable access to high-quality specialty care and recruitment and participation of AI/AN individuals and communities in clinical research.",

        "summary": "Here is a focused summary of the technical/research paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **1. Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** The paper addresses the critical need for a stronger, more coordinated, and independent Tribal public health infrastructure to effectively tackle persistent health disparities, the rise of chronic diseases, and significant data collection challenges among American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities \\cite{warne202500i}.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge:** The existing healthcare system, including the Indian Health Service (IHS), is severely underfunded and primarily operates on a medical model, which is insufficient for addressing population-wide health challenges. There is a lack of national, system-wide coordination and culturally and contextually appropriate resources, necessitating alternative, integrated public health strategies \\cite{warne202500i}.\n\n*   **2. Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** This work relates to the established model of public health institutes (PHIs) and the National Network for Public Health Institutes (NNPHI), adapting their feasibility models to the unique Tribal context. It also positions itself in relation to existing Tribally Led Organizations (TLOs) and Tribal Epidemiology Centers (TECs) \\cite{warne202500i}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:** The paper implicitly highlights the limitations of the current fragmented public health system for AI/AN communities, the underfunding and capacity constraints of federal agencies like IHS, and the inadequacy of a purely medical model to address complex, population-level health issues. It identifies a gap in national-level coordination and culturally appropriate technical assistance \\cite{warne202500i}.\n\n*   **3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The core method was an 18-month, Tribally-driven feasibility study for a Tribal Public Health Institute (TPHI). This involved a multi-component approach: Tribal Engagement (roundtables, advisory board), Market Analysis (needs/assets assessment, environmental scan), Organizational Analysis (review of existing structures), and Financial Analysis (identifying funding strategies) \\cite{warne202500i}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:** The innovation lies in the *concept* and *proposed framework* for a TPHI, which is designed to be a culturally and contextually appropriate, Tribally-driven entity. It aims to provide system-wide coordination, direct technical assistance, and capacity building for Tribal public health, operating independently from federal agencies and complementing existing services without duplication \\cite{warne202500i}.\n\n*   **4. Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms, Methods, or Techniques:** The project's methodology involved adapting standard non-profit/business feasibility models to explicitly address the \"uniqueness of the Tribal context\" \\cite{warne202500i}, ensuring a Tribally-driven process through extensive engagement and input from diverse Tribal stakeholders.\n    *   **System Design or Architectural Innovations:** The paper proposes a conceptual architecture for a TPHI, outlining its functions as a central coordinating body, a provider of technical expertise, a clearinghouse for culturally appropriate information and tools, and a capacity builder for the Tribal public health system. This includes creating strategic linkages across Tribal, state, and national public health systems \\cite{warne202500i}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights or Analysis:** The study provides a synthesized analysis demonstrating the *feasibility and desirability* of a TPHI, identifying specific roles and functions that would enhance the Tribal public health system by complementing existing services, respecting Tribal diversity, and fostering greater independence and effectiveness \\cite{warne202500i}.\n\n*   **5. Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** The \"TPHI Feasibility Project\" \\cite{warne202500i} served as the validation process, encompassing:\n        *   **Tribal Engagement:** Regional and national Tribal Roundtables, presentations, and informal conversations with a wide range of Tribal leaders and health professionals, guided by a Tribal Public Health Advisory Board \\cite{warne202500i}.\n        *   **Market Analysis:** A Needs and Assets Assessment of the Tribal public health system and an Environmental Scan of national public health initiatives, both structured around the 10 Essential Public Health Services \\cite{warne202500i}.\n        *   **Organizational Analysis:** A review of existing organizational structures among TLOs, PHIs, and other public health entities \\cite{warne202500i}.\n        *   **Financial Analysis:** An initial exploration of potential funding sources and strategies \\cite{warne202500i}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results:** The primary outcome was a qualitative assessment of feasibility and desirability. The synthesis of findings \"clearly suggest that a TPHI is feasible\" \\cite{warne202500i}. The project identified specific, actionable roles for a TPHI, such as providing technical expertise, serving as an information clearinghouse, and building capacity, which were validated through stakeholder input as needed and beneficial \\cite{warne202500i}.\n\n*   **6. Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations or Assumptions:** The report is a feasibility study, not an implementation plan. It explicitly states that \"Further financial analysis will be conducted to determine start-up costs and sustainability when an organizational structure, governance and programmatic functions are identified\" \\cite{warne202500i}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The proposed TPHI is specifically tailored to address the health needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities. Its design emphasizes respecting the diversity of Tribes and complementing, rather than duplicating or competing with, existing Tribal health services \\cite{warne202500i}.\n\n*   **7. Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** This work significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in public health infrastructure for AI/AN communities by proposing a dedicated, Tribally-driven institute. It shifts the paradigm from fragmented, federally-dependent services towards a more integrated, coordinated, and self-determined public health system \\cite{warne202500i}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:** The findings lay a crucial foundation for future research and development in establishing and operationalizing a TPHI. This includes detailed organizational design, governance models, funding strategies, and the development of culturally and contextually appropriate public health tools, training, and technical assistance specific to AI/AN needs, with the potential to significantly improve health outcomes and capacity within Tribal nations \\cite{warne202500i}.",

However, most adults with cancer do not participate in trials, and trials often fail to enroll enough patients to answer their scientific questions. Artificial intelligence could accelerate matching of patients to appropriate clinical trials.

MatchMiner-AI focuses on matching patients to potential trials based on core criteria describing clinical\"spaces,\"or disease contexts, targeted by a trial. It aims to accelerate the human work of identifying potential matches, not to fully automate trial screening. The pipeline includes modules for extraction of key information from a patient's longitudinal electronic health record; rapid ranking of candidate trial-patient matches based on embeddings in vector space; and classification of whether a candidate match represents a reasonable clinical consideration.

        "summary": "Clinical trials drive improvements in cancer treatments and outcomes. However, most adults with cancer do not participate in trials, and trials often fail to enroll enough patients to answer their scientific questions. Artificial intelligence could accelerate matching of patients to appropriate clinical trials. Here, we describe the development and evaluation of the MatchMiner-AI pipeline for clinical trial searching and ranking. MatchMiner-AI focuses on matching patients to potential trials based on core criteria describing clinical\"spaces,\"or disease contexts, targeted by a trial. It aims to accelerate the human work of identifying potential matches, not to fully automate trial screening. The pipeline includes modules for extraction of key information from a patient's longitudinal electronic health record; rapid ranking of candidate trial-patient matches based on embeddings in vector space; and classification of whether a candidate match represents a reasonable clinical consideration. Code and synthetic data are available at https://huggingface.co/ksg-dfci/MatchMiner-AI . Model weights based on synthetic data are available at https://huggingface.co/ksg-dfci/TrialSpace and https://huggingface.co/ksg-dfci/TrialChecker . A simple cancer clinical trial search engine to demonstrate pipeline components is available at https://huggingface.co/spaces/ksg-dfci/trial_search_alpha .",

AI algorithms can support abstraction and imputation approaches to assure the greatest number of clinical records get reviewed.

Methods: We conducted a prospective controlled observational study of an AI model to prioritize potentially eligible patients, as part of a phase 3, randomized, multi-site therapeutic trial for Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma. In this observational study, we studied eligibility criteria focused on measurable disease and prior anti-myeloma treatments. The AI eligibility model extracted structured eligibility criteria to predict likelihood of meeting study eligibility. A single CRC (Clinical Research Coordinator) allocated 40 hours to screening in both control and intervention phases of the study. In the control phase, the CRC screened myeloma patients\u2019 electronic health records in alphabetical order by last name. In the intervention phase, the CRC screened a different set of patients ranked by the eligibility likelihood model. Descriptive statistics were used to compare primary outcomes of efficiency (percentage of patients watch-listed) and speed (average time to screen a patient) between control and intervention phase. Patients marked as watch-listed meet eligibility criteria but need additional testing or disease progression before becoming eligible for the study. Results: The AI Eligibility method captured the same share (19%1) of screened patients as the EMR method, with a 3.3x (12.5 versus 41 minutes) improvement per screened patient. Conclusions: The AI eligibility method allows research staff to screen three times more patients with similar outcomes as compared to routine CRC EMR screening. Future work can leverage AI to identify and predict patient progression, further enhancing screening efficiency. [Table: see text]",

This study\u2019s aim is to discuss how AI can enhance the precision of ADC therapy by analyzing data from clinical trials and molecular biomarkers. This review highlights that AI can significantly reduce the time and cost associated with drug discovery and improve the targeting of cancer cells, reducing side effects and increasing treatment efficacy.

Abstract The medical research field has been tremendously galvanized to improve the prediction of therapy efficacy by the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI). An earnest desire to find better ways to predict the effectiveness of therapy with the use of AI has propelled the evolution of new models in which it can become more applicable in clinical settings such as breast cancer detection.

Given study-specific metadata, CTBench evaluates AI models' ability to determine the baseline features of a clinical trial (CT), which include demographic and relevant features collected at the trial's start from all participants. These baseline features, typically presented in CT publications (often as Table 1), are crucial for characterizing study cohorts and validating results. Baseline features, including confounders and covariates, are also necessary for accurate treatment effect estimation in studies involving observational data. CTBench consists of two datasets:\"CT-Repo,\"containing baseline features from 1,690 clinical trials sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, and\"CT-Pub,\"a subset of 100 trials with more comprehensive baseline features gathered from relevant publications. Two LM-based evaluation methods are developed to compare the actual baseline feature lists against LM-generated responses.\"ListMatch-LM\"and\"ListMatch-BERT\"use GPT-4o and BERT scores (at various thresholds), respectively, for evaluation. To establish baseline results, advanced prompt engineering techniques using LLaMa3-70B-Instruct and GPT-4o in zero-shot and three-shot learning settings are applied to generate potential baseline features. The performance of GPT-4o as an evaluator is validated through human-in-the-loop evaluations on the CT-Pub dataset, where clinical experts confirm matches between actual and LM-generated features. The results highlight a promising direction with significant potential for improvement, positioning CTBench as a useful tool for advancing research on AI in CT design and potentially enhancing the efficacy and robustness of CTs.",

These baseline features, typically presented in CT publications (often as Table 1), are crucial for characterizing study cohorts and validating results. Baseline features, including confounders and covariates, are also necessary for accurate treatment effect estimation in studies involving observational data. CTBench consists of two datasets:\"CT-Repo,\"containing baseline features from 1,690 clinical trials sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, and\"CT-Pub,\"a subset of 100 trials with more comprehensive baseline features gathered from relevant publications. Two LM-based evaluation methods are developed to compare the actual baseline feature lists against LM-generated responses.\"ListMatch-LM\"and\"ListMatch-BERT\"use GPT-4o and BERT scores (at various thresholds), respectively, for evaluation. To establish baseline results, advanced prompt engineering techniques using LLaMa3-70B-Instruct and GPT-4o in zero-shot and three-shot learning settings are applied to generate potential baseline features. The performance of GPT-4o as an evaluator is validated through human-in-the-loop evaluations on the CT-Pub dataset, where clinical experts confirm matches between actual and LM-generated features. The results highlight a promising direction with significant potential for improvement, positioning CTBench as a useful tool for advancing research on AI in CT design and potentially enhancing the efficacy and robustness of CTs.",

        "abstract": "Background Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted clinical trial screening is a promising prospect, although previous matching systems were developed in English, and relevant studies have only been conducted in Western countries. Therefore, we evaluated an AI-based clinical trial matching system (CTMS) that extracts medical data from the electronic health record system and matches them to clinical trials automatically. Methods This study included 1,053 consecutive inpatients primarily diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma who were referred to the liver tumor center of an academic medical center in China between January and December 2019. The eligibility criteria extracted from two clinical trials, patient attributes, and gold standard were decided manually. We evaluated the performance of the CTMS against the established gold standard by measuring the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and run time required. Results The manual reviewers demonstrated acceptable interrater reliability (Cohen\u2019s kappa 0.65\u20130.88). The performance results for the CTMS were as follows: accuracy, 92.9\u201398.0%; sensitivity, 51.9\u201383.5%; specificity, 99.0\u201399.1%; PPV, 75.7\u201385.1%; and NPV, 97.4\u201398.9%. The time required for eligibility determination by the CTMS and manual reviewers was 2 and 150 h, respectively. Conclusions We found that the CTMS is particularly reliable in excluding ineligible patients in a significantly reduced amount of time. The CTMS excluded ineligible patients for clinical trials with good performance, reducing 98.7% of the work time. Thus, such AI-based systems with natural language processing and machine learning have potential utility in Chinese clinical trials.

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n### Focused Summary for Literature Review\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   The paper addresses the technical challenge of efficiently and accurately screening patients for clinical trial eligibility, particularly in a Chinese language context \\cite{wang2024s40}.\n    *   This problem is critical because 20\u201340% of cancer clinical trials are impeded or fail due to a lack of candidates, and manual screening is a knowledge-demanding, time-consuming task for healthcare providers \\cite{wang2024s40}.\n    *   Existing AI-assisted clinical trial matching systems (CTMS) have primarily been developed for English language environments and Western countries, making them unsuitable for Chinese clinical records which feature substantial descriptive content and different semantic recognition patterns \\cite{wang2024s40}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   Previous AI-based CTMS, such as those reported by Ni et al. (2015), Mendel AI (2020), and IBM Watson, have shown promising results in English-speaking contexts for various cancer types (e.g., lung, breast cancer) \\cite{wang2024s40}.\n    *   Limitations of previous solutions include their development in English, making them inapplicable to the unique linguistic and structural characteristics of Chinese Electronic Health Records (EHRs) \\cite{wang2024s40}. The semantic recognition of Chinese sentences differs significantly from English, posing a challenge for direct adaptation \\cite{wang2024s40}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   The core technical method involves an AI-based CTMS integrated with the Chinese EHR system, leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to automate patient screening \\cite{wang2024s40}.\n    *   The CTMS framework consists of three primary steps: medical data extraction, construction of patient-specific disease datasets, and patient matching \\cite{wang2024s40}.\n    *   **Novelty**: The system is specifically designed for the Chinese language, addressing challenges like cross-ambiguity and combinatorial ambiguity in Chinese text \\cite{wang2024s40}. It employs advanced deep learning models for NLP tasks:\n        *   **Iterated Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (IDCNN)** for Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract medical entities (e.g., time, diagnosis, lab results) \\cite{wang2024s40}. IDCNN is chosen for its ability to achieve a larger receptive field and reduce information loss compared to traditional CNNs, leading to higher accuracy in entity recognition \\cite{wang2024s40}.\n        *   **Text Convolutional Neural Networks (TextCNN)** for entity-relationship linking, extracting complex relationships between medical entities (e.g., diagnosis-anatomical part-orientation-time) \\cite{wang2024s40}. TextCNN is used for its high accuracy and faster reasoning speed in this context \\cite{wang2024s40}.\n    *   Medical entities are mapped to standard medical terminologies (ICD-10, ICD-11, SNOMED CT), and a special disease knowledge base for HCC (approximately 150,000 datasets) is used with knowledge graph technology to derive extraction rules \\cite{wang2024s40}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**: Adaptation and application of IDCNN for NER and TextCNN for entity-relationship linking specifically for Chinese biomedical text, trained on large Chinese biomedical language understanding datasets (CBLUE 2.0) \\cite{wang2024s40}.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: Development of a CTMS architecture that effectively processes both structured and unstructured data from Chinese EHRs, including a rule-based matcher that applies computer-implemented clinical trial criteria to patient-specific disease datasets \\cite{wang2024s40}.\n    *   **Linguistic Adaptation**: Successful demonstration of an AI-based CTMS capable of handling the complexities of Chinese semantic recognition, which is a significant advancement over existing English-centric systems \\cite{wang2024s40}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: A retrospective study was performed on 1,053 consecutive inpatients primarily diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from an academic medical center in China \\cite{wang2024s40}. The CTMS was evaluated against two real-world clinical trials for HCC \\cite{wang2024s40}.\n    *   **Gold Standard**: A gold standard for trial eligibility was manually determined for each patient by two senior oncologists reviewing all EHR information, with a third oncologist resolving discrepancies. Interrater reliability was acceptable (Cohen\u2019s kappa 0.65\u20130.88) \\cite{wang2024s40}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results**:\n        *   **Accuracy**: 92.9\u201398.0% \\cite{wang2024s40}.\n        *   **Sensitivity**: 51.9\u201383.5% \\cite{wang2024s40}.\n        *   **Specificity**: 99.0\u201399.1% \\cite{wang2024s40}.\n        *   **Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**: 75.7\u201385.1% \\cite{wang2024s40}.\n        *   **Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**: 97.4\u201398.9% \\cite{wang2024s40}.\n        *   **Time Savings**: The CTMS required 2 hours for eligibility determination for all patients, compared to 150 hours for manual review, representing a 98.7% reduction in work time \\cite{wang2024s40}.\n        *   The CTMS successfully classified all actual participants (19 for Trial 1, 39 for Trial 2) as \"Consider\" \\cite{wang2024s40}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations**: Some errors were attributed to the insufficient capability of the CTMS itself, and others to the insufficient quality of medical records or discrepancies with manual reviewers' subjective judgments \\cite{wang2024s40}. The sensitivity for one trial (51.9%) was noted as lower than for the other \\cite{wang2024s40}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The study focused on HCC patients in a single academic medical center in China. While promising for Chinese clinical trials, its direct generalizability to other diseases or healthcare systems without further adaptation would need validation \\cite{wang2024s40}. The system prioritizes reliability in excluding ineligible patients, implying that manual review of \"Consider\" patients remains indispensable \\cite{wang2024s40}.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   This work significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of an AI-based CTMS specifically tailored for the complex Chinese language EHR environment \\cite{wang2024s40}.\n    *   The high specificity (99.0\u201399.1%) and substantial time reduction (98.7%) highlight its potential to drastically reduce the manual workload of excluding ineligible patients, thereby streamlining the clinical trial screening process \\cite{wang2024s40}.\n    *   **Potential Impact**: This system offers a blueprint for developing AI-driven solutions for clinical trial matching in non-English speaking regions, potentially increasing patient access to trials and accelerating cancer research globally \\cite{wang2024s40}. It underscores the utility of advanced NLP and ML techniques (IDCNN, TextCNN) for extracting nuanced medical information from unstructured clinical notes in challenging linguistic contexts \\cite{wang2024s40}.",

        "abstract": "Background: Colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) is becoming more widely available across Europe, but its uptake is slow due to the need for follow-up colonoscopy for therapeutic procedures and biopsies, which impacts its cost-effectiveness. One of the major factors driving the conversion to colonoscopy is the detection of excess polyps in CCE that cannot be matched during subsequent colonoscopy. The capsule\u2019s rocking motion, which can lead to duplicate reporting of the same polyp when viewed from different angles, is likely a key contributor. Objectives: This review aims to explore the types of polyp matching reported in the literature, assess matching techniques and matching accuracy, and evaluate the development of machine learning models to improve polyp matching in CCE and subsequent colonoscopy. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PubMed. Due to the scarcity of research in this area, the search encompassed clinical trials, observational studies, reviews, case series, and editorial letters. Three directly related studies were included, and ten indirectly related studies were included for review. Results: Polyp matching in colon capsule endoscopy still needs to be developed, with only one study focused on creating criteria to match polyps within the same CCE video. Another study established that experienced CCE readers have greater accuracy, reducing interobserver variability. A machine learning algorithm was developed in one study to match polyps between initial CCE and subsequent colonoscopy. Only around 50% of polyps were successfully matched, requiring further optimisation. As Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms advance in CCE polyp detection, the risk of duplicate reporting may increase when clinicians are presented with polyp images or timestamps, potentially complicating the transition to AI-assisted CCE reading in the future. Conclusions: Polyp matching in CCE is a developing field with considerable challenges, especially in matching polyps within the same video. Although AI shows potential for decent accuracy, more research is needed to refine these techniques and make CCE a more reliable, non-invasive alternative to complement conventional colonoscopy for lower GI investigations.",

The major challenge in diagnosing NPDs is the subjective assessment by the physician which can lead to inaccurate and delayed diagnosis. Recent studies have depicted that the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in neuropsychiatry could potentially revolutionize the field by precisely diagnosing complex neurological and mental health disorders in a timely fashion and providing individualized management strategies. In this narrative review, the authors have examined the current status of AI tools in assessing neuropsychiatric disorders and evaluated their validity and reliability in the existing literature. The analysis of various datasets including MRI scans, EEG, facial expressions, social media posts, texts, and laboratory samples in the accurate diagnosis of neuropsychiatric conditions using machine learning has been profoundly explored in this article. The recent trials and tribulations in various neuropsychiatric disorders encouraging future scope in the utility and application of AI have been discussed.

        "summary": "Neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs) pose a substantial burden on the healthcare system. The major challenge in diagnosing NPDs is the subjective assessment by the physician which can lead to inaccurate and delayed diagnosis. Recent studies have depicted that the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in neuropsychiatry could potentially revolutionize the field by precisely diagnosing complex neurological and mental health disorders in a timely fashion and providing individualized management strategies. In this narrative review, the authors have examined the current status of AI tools in assessing neuropsychiatric disorders and evaluated their validity and reliability in the existing literature. The analysis of various datasets including MRI scans, EEG, facial expressions, social media posts, texts, and laboratory samples in the accurate diagnosis of neuropsychiatric conditions using machine learning has been profoundly explored in this article. The recent trials and tribulations in various neuropsychiatric disorders encouraging future scope in the utility and application of AI have been discussed. Overall machine learning has proved to be feasible and applicable in the field of neuropsychiatry and it is about time that research translates to clinical settings for favorable patient outcomes. Future trials should focus on presenting higher quality evidence for superior adaptability and establish guidelines for healthcare providers to maintain standards.",

Objective This study aims to compare trial design factors of complete and incomplete clinical trials testing AI tools. We conducted a case-control study of complete (n=485) and incomplete (n=51) clinical trials that evaluated AI as an intervention of ClinicalTrials.gov. Methods Trial design factors, including area of clinical application, intended use population, and intended role of AI, were extracted. Trials that did not evaluate AI as an intervention and active trials were excluded. The assessed trial design factors related to AI interventions included the domain of clinical application related to organ systems; intended use population for patients or health care providers; and the role of AI for different applications in patient-facing clinical workflows, such as diagnosis, screening, and treatment. In addition, we also assessed general trial design factors including study type, allocation, intervention model, masking, age, sex, funder, continent, length of time, sample size, number of enrollment sites, and study start year. The main outcome was the completion of the clinical trial. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI values were calculated for all trial design factors using propensity-matched, multivariable logistic regression.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has facilitated the identification of homogeneous subgroups, but how to estimate the uncertainty of the model outputs when applying AI to clinical decision-making remains unknown. Objective We aimed to design an AI-based model for purposeful patient enrollment, ensuring that a patient with sepsis recruited into a trial would still be persistently ill by the time the proposed therapy could impact patient outcome. We also expected that the model could provide interpretable factors and estimate the uncertainty of the model outputs at a customized confidence level. Methods In this retrospective study, 9135 patients with sepsis requiring vasopressor treatment within 24 hours after sepsis onset were enrolled from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. This cohort was used for model development, and 10-fold cross-validation with 50 repeats was used for internal validation. In total, 3743 patients with sepsis from the eICU Collaborative Research Database were used as the external validation cohort. All included patients with sepsis were stratified based on disease progression trajectories: rapid death, recovery, and persistent ill. A total of 148 variables were selected for predicting the 3 trajectories. Four machine learning algorithms with 3 different setups were used. We estimated the uncertainty of the model outputs using conformal prediction (CP). The Shapley Additive Explanations method was used to explain the model. Results The multiclass gradient boosting machine was identified as the best-performing model with good discrimination and calibration performance in both validation cohorts. The mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with SD was 0.906 (0.018) for rapid death, 0.843 (0.008) for recovery, and 0.807 (0.010) for persistent ill in the internal validation cohort. In the external validation cohort, the mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (SD) was 0.878 (0.003) for rapid death, 0.764 (0.008) for recovery, and 0.696 (0.007) for persistent ill. The maximum norepinephrine equivalence, total urine output, Acute Physiology Score III, mean systolic blood pressure, and the coefficient of variation of oxygen saturation contributed the most. Compared to the model without CP, using the model with CP at a mixed confidence approach reduced overall prediction errors by 27.6% (n=62) and 30.7% (n=412) in the internal and external validation cohorts, respectively, as well as enabled the identification of more potentially persistent ill patients. Conclusions The implementation of our model has the potential to reduce heterogeneity and enroll more homogeneous patients in sepsis clinical trials. The use of CP for estimating the uncertainty of the model outputs allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the model\u2019s reliability and assists in making informed decisions based on the predicted outcomes.",

We explore their applications in four critical areas, evidence synthesis, evidence generation, clinical trials and economic modeling: (1) Evidence synthesis: Generative AI has the potential to assist in automating literature reviews and meta-analyses by proposing search terms, screening abstracts, and extracting data with notable accuracy; (2) Evidence generation: These models can potentially facilitate automating the process and analyze the increasingly available large collections of real-world data (RWD), including unstructured clinical notes and imaging, enhancing the speed and quality of real-world evidence (RWE) generation; (3) Clinical trials: Generative AI can be used to optimize trial design, improve patient matching, and manage trial data more efficiently; and (4) Economic modeling: Generative AI can also aid in the development of health economic models, from conceptualization to validation, thus streamlining the overall HTA process. Despite their promise, these technologies, while rapidly improving, are still nascent and continued careful evaluation in their applications to HTA is required. To ensure their responsible use and implementation, both developers and users of research incorporating these tools, should familiarize themselves with their current limitations, including the issues related to scientific validity, risk of bias, and consider equity and ethical implications.

        "abstract": "Simple Summary Radiation therapy (RT) plans deviating from the standard could likely compromise the efficacy of a pre-specified intervention for any clinical trial due either to insufficient coverage of the target area and/or excessive radiation doses to healthy tissues. Knowledge-based machine learning tools utilize high-quality data and generate patient-specific optimization objectives that produce RT plans that comply better with treatment protocol specifications. In this study, we investigated the use of a knowledge-based planning (KBP) model to evaluate the quality of RT plans in two clinical trials, one for glioblastoma and the other for head and neck cancer. The outcomes of this research indicate that this tool can assist RT quality assessments in multi-center clinical trials. Abstract The quality of radiation therapy (RT) treatment plans directly affects the outcomes of clinical trials. KBP solutions have been utilized in RT plan quality assurance (QA). In this study, we evaluated the quality of RT plans for brain and head/neck cancers enrolled in multi-institutional clinical trials utilizing a KBP approach. The evaluation was conducted on 203 glioblastoma (GBM) patients enrolled in NRG-BN001 and 70 nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients enrolled in NRG-HN001. For each trial, fifty high-quality photon plans were utilized to build a KBP photon model. A KBP proton model was generated using intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) plans generated on 50 patients originally treated with photon RT. These models were then applied to generate KBP plans for the remaining patients, which were compared against the submitted plans for quality evaluation, including in terms of protocol compliance, target coverage, and organ-at-risk (OAR) doses. RT plans generated by the KBP models were demonstrated to have superior quality compared to the submitted plans. KBP IMPT plans can decrease the variation of proton plan quality and could possibly be used as a tool for developing improved plans in the future. Additionally, the KBP tool proved to be an effective instrument for RT plan QA in multi-center clinical trials.",

This study aims to develop an integrated artificial intelligence (AI) and physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) platform to rapidly estimate drug in vivo fate based solely on molecular structures. The AI models were trained to predict eight types of key properties (solubility, pKa values, crystal density, intrinsic dissolution rate, apparent permeability, protein unbound fraction, plasma clearance, and tissue partition coefficients for 15 organs), from which the PBPK model forecasted PK curves without further training. The AI-PBPK approach was validated against human PK data of 71 intravenous and 606 oral administrations collected from the PK-DB database. The results were robust, with most of the AUC predictions falling within two and threefold error ranges. The AI-PBPK model also accurately predicted drug organ selectivity, and for drugs exhibiting high plasma clearance, predictions were optimized through an inter-species extrapolation approach. This study illustrates that the developed modeling strategy adeptly addresses pivotal PK challenges in drug discovery and aligns with contemporary drug development processes.
