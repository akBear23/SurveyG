      "abstract": "Abstract Objectives To assess the clinical readiness and deployability of artificial intelligence (AI) through evaluation of prospective studies of AI in cancer care following diagnosis. Design We undertook a systematic review to determine the types of AI involved and their respective outcomes with a PubMed and Web of Science search between 1 January 2013 and 1 May 2023.15 articles detailing prospective evaluation of AI in postdiagnostic cancer pathway were identified. Setting The role of AI in cancer care has evolved in the face of ageing population, workforce shortages and technological advancement. Despite recent uptake in AI research and adoption, the extent to which it improves quality, efficiency and equity of care beyond cancer diagnostics is uncertain to date. Interventions We appraised all studies using Risk of Bias Assessment of Randomised Controlled Trials (ROB2) and Risk of Bias In Nonrandomised Studies- of Interventions (ROBINI) quality assessment tools, as well as implementational analysis concerning time, cost and resource, to ascertain the quality of clinical evidence and real-world feasibility of AI. Results The results revealed that the majority of AI oncological research remained experimental without prospective clinical validation or deployment. Most studies failed to establish clinical validity and to translate measured AI efficacy into beneficial clinical outcomes. AI research is limited by lack of research standardisation and health system interoperability. Furthermore, implementational analysis and equity considerations of AI were largely missing. Conclusion To overcome the triad of low-level clinical evidence, efficacy-outcome gap and incompatible research ecosystem for AI, future work should focus on multi-collaborative AI implementation research designed and conducted in accordance with up-to-date research standards and local health systems.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are exhibiting remarkable performance in clinical contexts, with exemplar results ranging from expert-level attainment in medical examination questions to superior accuracy and relevance when responding to patient queries compared to real doctors replying to queries on social media. The deployment of LLMs in conventional health care settings is yet to be reported, and there remains an open question as to what evidence should be required before such deployment is warranted. Early validation studies use unvalidated surrogate variables to represent clinical aptitude, and it may be necessary to conduct prospective randomized controlled trials to justify the use of an LLM for clinical advice or assistance, as potential pitfalls and pain points cannot be exhaustively predicted. This viewpoint states that as LLMs continue to revolutionize the field, there is an opportunity to improve the rigor of artificial intelligence (AI) research to reward innovation, conferring real benefits to real patients.",

      "abstract": "A growing number of artificial intelligence (AI)-based clinical decision support systems are showing promising performance in preclinical, in silico, evaluation, but few have yet demonstrated real benefit to patient care. Early stage clinical evaluation is important to assess an AI system\u2019s actual clinical performance at small scale, ensure its safety, evaluate the human factors surrounding its use, and pave the way to further large scale trials. However, the reporting of these early studies remains inadequate. The present statement provides a multistakeholder, consensus-based reporting guideline for the Developmental and Exploratory Clinical Investigations of DEcision support systems driven by Artificial Intelligence (DECIDE-AI). We conducted a two round, modified Delphi process to collect and analyse expert opinion on the reporting of early clinical evaluation of AI systems. Experts were recruited from 20 predefined stakeholder categories. The final composition and wording of the guideline was determined at a virtual consensus meeting. The checklist and the Explanation & Elaboration (E&E) sections were refined based on feedback from a qualitative evaluation process. 123 experts participated in the first round of Delphi, 138 in the second, 16 in the consensus meeting, and 16 in the qualitative evaluation. The DECIDE-AI reporting guideline comprises 17 AI specific reporting items (made of 28 subitems) and 10 generic reporting items, with an E&E paragraph provided for each. Through consultation and consensus with a range of stakeholders, we have developed a guideline comprising key items that should be reported in early stage clinical studies of AI-based decision support systems in healthcare. By providing an actionable checklist of minimal reporting items, the DECIDE-AI guideline will facilitate the appraisal of these studies and replicability of their findings.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objective The objective of this technical study was to evaluate the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based system for clinical trials matching for a cohort of lung cancer patients in an Australian cancer hospital. Methods A lung cancer cohort was derived from clinical data from patients attending an Australian cancer hospital. Ten phases I\u2013III clinical trials registered on clinicaltrials.gov and open to lung cancer patients at this institution were utilized for assessments. The trial matching system performance was compared to a gold standard established by clinician consensus for trial eligibility. Results The study included 102 lung cancer patients. The trial matching system evaluated 7252 patient attributes (per patient median 74, range 53\u2013100) against 11\u2009467 individual trial eligibility criteria (per trial median 597, range 243\u20134132). Median time for the system to run a query and return results was 15.5\u2009s (range 7.2\u201337.8). In establishing the gold standard, clinician interrater agreement was high (Cohen\u2019s kappa 0.70\u20131.00). On a per-patient basis, the performance of the trial matching system for eligibility was as follows: accuracy, 91.6%; recall (sensitivity), 83.3%; precision (positive predictive value), 76.5%; negative predictive value, 95.7%; and specificity, 93.8%. Discussion and Conclusion The AI-based clinical trial matching system allows efficient and reliable screening of cancer patients for clinical trials with 95.7% accuracy for exclusion and 91.6% accuracy for overall eligibility assessment; however, clinician input and oversight are still required. The automated system demonstrates promise as a clinical decision support tool to prescreen a large patient cohort to identify subjects suitable for further assessment.",

      "abstract": "PURPOSE\nTo update the ASCO clinical practice guideline on adjuvant endocrine therapy based on emerging data about the optimal duration of aromatase inhibitor (AI) treatment.\n\n\nMETHODS\nASCO conducted a systematic review of randomized clinical trials from 2012 to 2018. Guideline recommendations were based on the Panel's review of the evidence from six trials.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe six included studies of AI treatment beyond 5 years of therapy demonstrated that extension of AI treatment was not associated with an overall survival advantage but was significantly associated with lower risks of breast cancer recurrence and contralateral breast cancer compared with placebo. Bone-related toxic effects were more common with extended AI treatment.\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nThe Panel recommends that women with node-positive breast cancer receive extended therapy, including an AI, for up to a total of 10 years of adjuvant endocrine treatment. Many women with node-negative breast cancer should consider extended therapy for up to a total of 10 years of adjuvant endocrine treatment based on considerations of recurrence risk using established prognostic factors. The Panel noted that the benefits in absolute risk of reduction were modest and that, for lower-risk node-negative or limited node-positive cancers, an individualized approach to treatment duration that is based on considerations of risk reduction and tolerability was appropriate. A substantial portion of the benefit for extended adjuvant AI therapy was derived from prevention of second breast cancers. Shared decision making between clinicians and patients is appropriate for decisions about extended adjuvant endocrine treatment, including discussions about the absolute benefits in the reduction of breast cancer recurrence, the prevention of second breast cancers, and the impact of adverse effects of treatment.

      "abstract": "BackgroundArtificial intelligence (AI) research in healthcare is accelerating rapidly, with potential applications being demonstrated across various domains of medicine. However, there are currently limited examples of such techniques being successfully deployed into clinical practice. This article explores the main challenges and limitations of AI in healthcare, and considers the steps required to translate these potentially transformative technologies from research to clinical practice.Main bodyKey challenges for the translation of AI systems in healthcare include those intrinsic to the science of machine learning, logistical difficulties in implementation, and consideration of the barriers to adoption as well as of the necessary sociocultural or pathway changes. Robust peer-reviewed clinical evaluation as part of randomised controlled trials should be viewed as the gold standard for evidence generation, but conducting these in practice may not always be appropriate or feasible. Performance metrics should aim to capture real clinical applicability and be understandable to intended users. Regulation that balances the pace of innovation with the potential for harm, alongside thoughtful post-market surveillance, is required to ensure that patients are not exposed to dangerous interventions nor deprived of access to beneficial innovations. Mechanisms to enable direct comparisons of AI systems must be developed, including the use of independent, local and representative test sets. Developers of AI algorithms must be vigilant to potential dangers, including dataset shift, accidental fitting of confounders, unintended discriminatory bias, the challenges of generalisation to new populations, and the unintended negative consequences of new algorithms on health outcomes.ConclusionThe safe and timely translation of AI research into clinically validated and appropriately regulated systems that can benefit everyone is challenging. Robust clinical evaluation, using metrics that are intuitive to clinicians and ideally go beyond measures of technical accuracy to include quality of care and patient outcomes, is essential. Further work is required (1) to identify themes of algorithmic bias and unfairness while developing mitigations to address these, (2) to reduce brittleness and improve generalisability, and (3) to develop methods for improved interpretability of machine learning predictions. If these goals can be achieved, the benefits for patients are likely to be transformational.",

      "abstract": "The CONSORT 2010 statement provides minimum guidelines for reporting randomized trials. Its widespread use has been instrumental in ensuring transparency in the evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate impact on health outcomes. The CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials\u2013Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trials evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for clinical trial protocols: SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials\u2013Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 29 candidate items, which were assessed by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a two-day consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The CONSORT-AI extension includes 14 new items that were considered sufficiently important for AI interventions that they should be routinely reported in addition to the core CONSORT 2010 items. CONSORT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention is integrated, the handling of inputs and outputs of the AI intervention, the human\u2013AI interaction and provision of an analysis of error cases. CONSORT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness in reporting clinical trials for AI interventions. It will assist editors and peer reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret and critically appraise the quality of clinical trial design and risk of bias in the reported outcomes.

      "abstract": "The global healthcare sector continues to grow rapidly and is reflected as one of the fastest-growing sectors in the fourth industrial revolution (4.0). The majority of the healthcare industry still uses labor-intensive, time-consuming, and error-prone traditional, manual, and manpower-based methods. This review addresses the current paradigm, the potential for new scientific discoveries, the technological state of preparation, the potential for supervised machine learning (SML) prospects in various healthcare sectors, and ethical issues. The effectiveness and potential for innovation of disease diagnosis, personalized medicine, clinical trials, non-invasive image analysis, drug discovery, patient care services, remote patient monitoring, hospital data, and nanotechnology in various learning-based automation in healthcare along with the requirement for explainable artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare are evaluated. In order to understand the potential architecture of non-invasive treatment, a thorough study of medical imaging analysis from a technical point of view is presented. This study also represents new thinking and developments that will push the boundaries and increase the opportunity for healthcare through AI and SML in the near future. Nowadays, SML-based applications require a lot of data quality awareness as healthcare is data-heavy, and knowledge management is paramount. Nowadays, SML in biomedical and healthcare developments needs skills, quality data consciousness for data-intensive study, and a knowledge-centric health management system. As a result, the merits, demerits, and precautions need to take ethics and the other effects of AI and SML into consideration. The overall insight in this paper will help researchers in academia and industry to understand and address the future research that needs to be discussed on SML in the healthcare and biomedical sectors.",

During the collection of the data, intentionally or unintentionally, certain minorities, races, ethnicities, or genders may be significantly misrepresented. Therefore, these algorithms are biased and inadequately represent the general population 14,15 . This bias effect could be magnified by the reluctance of medical practitioners, hospitals, or other health organizations, to provide the medical files of their patients due to fears of security leaks. Another significant danger of medical data misuse is the data poisoning effect, which refers to the deliberate manipulation of medical data to introduce errors or biases in healthcare. This has serious consequences on the accuracy and reliability of medical recommendations. This could also affect the outcomes of clinical trials or insurance claims 11 . Finally, when AI uses different epidemiological data models, as was seen during the COVID-19 epidemic, this could lead to different conclusions",

      "abstract": "Purpose To compare the prognostic value and reproducibility of visual versus AI-assisted analysis of lung involvement on submillisievert low-dose chest CT in COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods This was a HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board-approved retrospective study. From March 15 to June 1, 2020, 250 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients were studied with low-dose chest CT at admission. Visual and AI-assisted analysis of lung involvement was performed by using a semi-quantitative CT score and a quantitative percentage of lung involvement. Adverse outcome was defined as intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death. Cox regression analysis, Kaplan-Meier curves, and cross-validated receiver operating characteristic curve with area under the curve (AUROC) analysis was performed to compare model performance. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and Bland- Altman analysis was used to assess intra- and interreader reproducibility. Results Adverse outcome occurred in 39 patients (11 deaths, 28 ICU admissions). AUC values from AI-assisted analysis were significantly higher than those from visual analysis for both semi-quantitative CT scores and percentages of lung involvement (all P<0.001). Intrareader and interreader agreement rates were significantly higher for AI-assisted analysis than visual analysis (all ICC \u22650.960 versus \u22650.885). AI-assisted variability for quantitative percentage of lung involvement was 17.2% (coefficient of variation) versus 34.7% for visual analysis. The sample size to detect a 5% change in lung involvement with 90% power and an \u03b1 error of 0.05 was 250 patients with AI-assisted analysis and 1014 patients with visual analysis. Conclusion AI-assisted analysis of lung involvement on submillisievert low-dose chest CT outperformed conventional visual analysis in predicting outcome in COVID-19 patients while reducing CT variability. Lung involvement on chest CT could be used as a reliable metric in future clinical trials.",

      "abstract": "Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a common reason for the withdrawal of a drug from the market. Early assessment of DILI risk is an essential part of drug development, but it is rendered challenging prior to clinical trials by the complex factors that give rise to liver damage. Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, particularly those building on machine learning, range from random forests to more recent techniques such as deep learning, and provide tools that can analyze chemical compounds and accurately predict some of their properties based purely on their structure. This article reviews existing AI approaches to predicting DILI and elaborates on the challenges that arise from the as yet limited availability of data. Future directions are discussed focusing on rich data modalities, such as 3D spheroids, and the slow but steady increase in drugs annotated with DILI risk labels.",

      "abstract": "The SPIRIT 2013 statement aims to improve the completeness of clinical trial protocol reporting by providing evidence-based recommendations for the minimum set of items to be addressed. This guidance has been instrumental in promoting transparent evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate their impact on health outcomes. The SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials\u2013Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trial protocols evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for trial reports: CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials\u2013Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 26 candidate items, which were consulted upon by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The SPIRIT-AI extension includes 15 new items that were considered sufficiently important for clinical trial protocols of AI interventions. These new items should be routinely reported in addition to the core SPIRIT 2013 items. SPIRIT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention will be integrated, considerations for the handling of input and output data, the human\u2013AI interaction and analysis of error cases. SPIRIT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness for clinical trial protocols for AI interventions. Its use will assist editors and peer reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret and critically appraise the design and risk of bias for a planned clinical trial. The CONSORT-AI and SPIRIT-AI extensions improve the transparency of clinical trial design and trial protocol reporting for artificial intelligence interventions.",

      "abstract": "This article offers an analysis of the ways in which digital health innovations are being coproduced by mainstreaming of artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and cyber-physical systems (CPS) in health care. CPS blurs the boundaries between the physical and virtual worlds, and creates a dynamic digital map of all things in existence that can be analyzed in ways that are much more sophisticated than a bar code scanning system. Examples of CPS include self-driving cars, wearables for digital monitoring of heart arrhythmias, industrial AI-powered robots in smart factories and health robots delivering home care services to disabled persons and rural communities. Another interesting prospect of digital health powered by AI, IoT, and CPS is remote phenotypic data capture and characterization of pharmaceutical outcomes in clinical trials in ways that are user centric and meaningful to patients. For rural or remote communities with limited access to medical product information, the IoT could bring about pharmacy and health services innovation. There are unprecedented societal challenges at intersections of digital health with AI, IoT, and CPS as well. For example, the physical and virtual worlds markedly differ in speed, scale, and temporalities, as do our physical self and digital footprints. Our efforts to map and develop effective solutions to societal corollaries of AI, IoT, and CPS need to bear in mind such asymmetries between the physical and virtual worlds. A societal issue such as privacy may emerge in different forms and intensities in the physical and virtual contexts. Digital data are highly fluid and can rapidly move across spaces and places, whereas the physical data and humans are much slower and exist in different scales than our digital footprints. It is therefore timely for the system sciences and integrative biology communities to critically engage with digital health and the related technologies, such as AI, IoT, and CPS.",

      "abstract": "The global COVID-19 pandemic has affected all spheres of human life, resulting in millions of deaths and overwhelming medical facilities. Moreover, the world has witnessed great financial hardship because of job losses resulting in economic havoc. Many sections of society have contributed in different ways to slow the spread of the virus and protect public health. For example, medical scientists are praised for their efforts to develop COVID-19 vaccines. Clinical trials have shown that the COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infections. However, many people around the world have been hesitant to get vaccinated. Vaccine misconceptions have emerged and increased due to a combination of factors, including the availability of information on the Internet and the influence of celebrities and opinion leaders. In this context, we have analyzed ChatGPT responses to relevant queries on vaccine misconceptions. The positive responses and supportive opinions provided by the AI chatbot could be instrumental in shaping people\u2019s perceptions of vaccines and in encouraging users to get vaccinated and reduce misconceptions.",

      "abstract": "Background Screening patients for eligibility for clinical trials is labor intensive. It requires abstraction of data elements from multiple components of the longitudinal health record and matching them to inclusion and exclusion criteria for each trial. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been developed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of this process. Objective This study aims to evaluate the ability of an AI clinical decision support system (CDSS) to identify eligible patients for a set of clinical trials. Methods This study included the deidentified data from a cohort of patients with breast cancer seen at the medical oncology clinic of an academic medical center between May and July 2017 and assessed patient eligibility for 4 breast cancer clinical trials. CDSS eligibility screening performance was validated against manual screening. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for eligibility determinations were calculated. Disagreements between manual screeners and the CDSS were examined to identify sources of discrepancies. Interrater reliability between manual reviewers was analyzed using Cohen (pairwise) and Fleiss (three-way) \u03ba, and the significance of differences was determined by Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results In total, 318 patients with breast cancer were included. Interrater reliability for manual screening ranged from 0.60-0.77, indicating substantial agreement. The overall accuracy of breast cancer trial eligibility determinations by the CDSS was 87.6%. CDSS sensitivity was 81.1% and specificity was 89%. Conclusions The AI CDSS in this study demonstrated accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of greater than 80% in determining the eligibility of patients for breast cancer clinical trials. CDSSs can accurately exclude ineligible patients for clinical trials and offer the potential to increase screening efficiency and accuracy. Additional research is needed to explore whether increased efficiency in screening and trial matching translates to improvements in trial enrollment, accruals, feasibility assessments, and cost.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 global pandemic is a threat not only to the health of millions of individuals, but also to the stability of infrastructure and economies around the world. The disease will inevitably place an overwhelming burden on healthcare systems that cannot be effectively dealt with by existing facilities or responses based on conventional approaches. We believe that a rigorous clinical and societal response can only be mounted by using intelligence derived from a variety of data sources to better utilize scarce healthcare resources, provide personalized patient management plans, inform policy, and expedite clinical trials. In this paper, we introduce five of the most important challenges in responding to COVID-19 and show how each of them can be addressed by recent developments in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). We argue that the integration of these techniques into local, national, and international healthcare systems will save lives, and propose specific methods by which implementation can happen swiftly and efficiently. We offer to extend these resources and knowledge to assist policymakers seeking to implement these techniques.",

      "abstract": "Standard therapy for advanced Prostate Cancer (PCa) consists of antiandrogens, which provide respite from disease progression, but ultimately fail resulting in the incurable phase of the disease: mCRPC. Targeting PCa cells before their progression to mCRPC would greatly improve the outcome. Combination therapy targeting the DNA Damage Response (DDR) has been limited by general toxicity, and a goal of clinical trials is how to target the DDR more specifically. We now show that androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) of LNCaP cells results in increased expression of TLK1B, a key kinase upstream of NEK1 and ATR and mediating the DDR that typically results in a temporary cell cycle arrest of androgen responsive PCa cells. Following DNA damage, addition of the TLK specific inhibitor, thioridazine (THD), impairs ATR and Chk1 activation, establishing the existence of a ADT\u2009>\u2009TLK1\u2009>\u2009NEK1\u2009>\u2009ATR\u2009>\u2009Chk1, DDR pathway, while its abrogation leads to apoptosis. Treatment with THD suppressed the outgrowth of androgen\u2010independent (AI) colonies of LNCaP and TRAMP\u2010C2 cells cultured with bicalutamide. Moreover, THD significantly inhibited the growth of several PCa cells in vitro (including AI lines). Administration of THD or bicalutamide was not effective at inhibiting long\u2010term tumor growth of LNCaP xenografts. In contrast, combination therapy remarkably inhibited tumor growth via bypass of the DDR. Moreover, xenografts of LNCaP cells overexpressing a NEK1\u2010T141A mutant were durably suppressed with bicalutamide. Collectively, these results suggest that targeting the TLK1/NEK1 axis might be a novel therapy for PCa in combination with standard of care (ADT).",

This study aimed to investigate the clinical impact and quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving interventions evaluating TS, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) prediction tools. A systematic review on PubMed was conducted to identify RCTs involving TS/ML/DL tool interventions in the past decade. A total of 65 RCTs from 26,082 records were included. A majority of them had model development studies and generally good performance was achieved. The function of TS and ML tools in the RCTs mainly included assistive treatment decisions, assistive diagnosis, and risk stratification, but DL trials were only conducted for assistive diagnosis. Nearly two-fifths of the trial interventions showed no clinical benefit compared to standard care. Though DL and ML interventions achieved higher rates of positive results than TS in the RCTs, in trials with low risk of bias (17/65) the advantage of DL to TS was reduced while the advantage of ML to TS disappeared. The current applications of DL were not yet fully spread performed in medicine. It is predictable that DL will integrate more complex clinical problems than ML and TS tools in the future. Therefore, rigorous studies are required before the clinical application of these tools.",

      "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) has been highly advancing in the last decade, machine learning (ML)-enabled medical devices are increasingly used in healthcare. In this study, we collected publicly available information on AI/ML-enabled medical devices approved by the FDA in the United States, as of the latest update on 19 October 2023. We performed comprehensive analysis of a total of 691 FDA-approved artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)-enabled medical devices and offer an in-depth analysis of clearance pathways, approval timeline, regulation type, medical specialty, decision type, recall history, etc. We found a significant surge in approvals since 2018, with clear dominance of the radiology specialty in the application of machine learning tools, attributed to the abundant data from routine clinical data. The study also reveals a reliance on the 510(k)-clearance pathway, emphasizing its basis on substantial equivalence and often bypassing the need for new clinical trials. Also, it notes an underrepresentation of pediatric-focused devices and trials, suggesting an opportunity for expansion in this demographic. Moreover, the geographical limitation of clinical trials, primarily within the United States, points to a need for more globally inclusive trials to encompass diverse patient demographics. This analysis not only maps the current landscape of AI/ML-enabled medical devices but also pinpoints trends, potential gaps, and areas for future exploration, clinical trial practices, and regulatory approaches. In conclusion, our analysis sheds light on the current state of FDA-approved AI/ML-enabled medical devices and prevailing trends, contributing to a wider comprehension.",

      "abstract": "Background Heterogeneity among patients\u2019 responses to treatment is prevalent in psychiatric disorders. Personalized medicine approaches\u2014which involve parsing patients into subgroups better indicated for a particular treatment\u2014could therefore improve patient outcomes and serve as a powerful tool in patient selection within clinical trials. Machine learning approaches can identify patient subgroups but are often not \u201cexplainable\u201d due to the use of complex algorithms that do not mirror clinicians\u2019 natural decision-making processes. Methods Here we combine two analytical approaches\u2014Personalized Advantage Index and Bayesian Rule Lists\u2014to identify paliperidone-indicated schizophrenia patients in a way that emphasizes model explainability. We apply these approaches retrospectively to randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial data to identify a paliperidone-indicated subgroup of schizophrenia patients who demonstrate a larger treatment effect (outcome on treatment superior than on placebo) than that of the full randomized sample as assessed with Cohen\u2019s d. For this study, the outcome corresponded to a reduction in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score which measures positive (e.g., hallucinations, delusions), negative (e.g., blunted affect, emotional withdrawal), and general psychopathological (e.g., disturbance of volition, uncooperativeness) symptoms in schizophrenia. Results Using our combined explainable AI approach to identify a subgroup more responsive to paliperidone than placebo, the treatment effect increased significantly over that of the full sample (p\u2009<\u20090.0001 for a one-sample t-test comparing the full sample Cohen\u2019s d\u2009=\u20090.82 and a generated distribution of subgroup Cohen\u2019s d\u2019s with mean d\u2009=\u20091.22, std d\u2009=\u20090.09). In addition, our modeling approach produces simple logical statements ( if\u2013then-else) , termed a \u201crule list\u201d, to ease interpretability for clinicians. A majority of the rule lists generated from cross-validation found two general psychopathology symptoms, disturbance of volition and uncooperativeness, to predict membership in the paliperidone-indicated subgroup. Conclusions These results help to technically validate our explainable AI approach to patient selection for a clinical trial by identifying a subgroup with an improved treatment effect. With these data, the explainable rule lists also suggest that paliperidone may provide an improved therapeutic benefit for the treatment of schizophrenia patients with either of the symptoms of high disturbance of volition or high uncooperativeness.

      "abstract": "Introduction The lack of effective, consistent, reproducible and efficient asthma ascertainment methods results in inconsistent asthma cohorts and study results for clinical trials or other studies. We aimed to assess whether application of expert artificial intelligence (AI)-based natural language processing (NLP) algorithms for two existing asthma criteria to electronic health records of a paediatric population systematically identifies childhood asthma and its subgroups with distinctive characteristics. Methods Using the 1997\u20132007 Olmsted County Birth Cohort, we applied validated NLP algorithms for Predetermined Asthma Criteria (NLP-PAC) as well as Asthma Predictive Index (NLP-API). We categorised subjects into four groups (both criteria positive (NLP-PAC+/NLP-API+); PAC positive only (NLP-PAC+ only); API positive only (NLP-API+ only); and both criteria negative (NLP-PAC\u2212/NLP-API\u2212)) and characterised them. Results were replicated in unsupervised cluster analysis for asthmatics and a random sample of 300 children using laboratory and pulmonary function tests (PFTs). Results Of the 8196 subjects (51% male, 80% white), we identified 1614 (20%), NLP-PAC+/NLP-API+; 954 (12%), NLP-PAC+ only; 105 (1%), NLP-API+ only; and 5523 (67%), NLP-PAC\u2212/NLP-API\u2212. Asthmatic children classified as NLP-PAC+/NLP-API+ showed earlier onset asthma, more Th2-high profile, poorer lung function, higher asthma exacerbation and higher risk of asthma-associated comorbidities compared with other groups. These results were consistent with those based on unsupervised cluster analysis and lab and PFT data of a random sample of study subjects. Conclusion Expert AI-based NLP algorithms for two asthma criteria systematically identify childhood asthma with distinctive characteristics. This approach may improve precision, reproducibility, consistency and efficiency of large-scale clinical studies for asthma and enable population management.",

      "abstract": "Objective To provide a comprehensive framework for value assessment of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology. Methods This paper presents the RADAR framework, which has been adapted from Fryback and Thornbury\u2019s imaging efficacy framework to facilitate the valuation of radiology AI from conception to local implementation. Local efficacy has been newly introduced to underscore the importance of appraising an AI technology within its local environment. Furthermore, the RADAR framework is illustrated through a myriad of study designs that help assess value. Results RADAR presents a seven-level hierarchy, providing radiologists, researchers, and policymakers with a structured approach to the comprehensive assessment of value in radiology AI. RADAR is designed to be dynamic and meet the different valuation needs throughout the AI\u2019s lifecycle. Initial phases like technical and diagnostic efficacy (RADAR-1 and RADAR-2) are assessed pre-clinical deployment via in silico clinical trials and cross-sectional studies. Subsequent stages, spanning from diagnostic thinking to patient outcome efficacy (RADAR-3 to RADAR-5), require clinical integration and are explored via randomized controlled trials and cohort studies. Cost-effectiveness efficacy (RADAR-6) takes a societal perspective on financial feasibility, addressed via health-economic evaluations. The final level, RADAR-7, determines how prior valuations translate locally, evaluated through budget impact analysis, multi-criteria decision analyses, and prospective monitoring. Conclusion The RADAR framework offers a comprehensive framework for valuing radiology AI. Its layered, hierarchical structure, combined with a focus on local relevance, aligns RADAR seamlessly with the principles of value-based radiology. Critical relevance statement The RADAR framework advances artificial intelligence in radiology by delineating a much-needed framework for comprehensive valuation. Keypoints \u2022 Radiology artificial intelligence lacks a comprehensive approach to value assessment. \u2022 The RADAR framework provides a dynamic, hierarchical method for thorough valuation of radiology AI. \u2022 RADAR advances clinical radiology by bridging the artificial intelligence implementation gap.",

      "title": "Reporting guidelines for clinical trials of artificial intelligence interventions: the SPIRIT-AI and CONSORT-AI guidelines",
      "abstract": "Background The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is an area of immense interest. The high profile of \u2018AI in health\u2019 means that there are unusually strong drivers to accelerate the introduction and implementation of innovative AI interventions, which may not be supported by the available evidence, and for which the usual systems of appraisal may not yet be sufficient. Main text We are beginning to see the emergence of randomised clinical trials evaluating AI interventions in real-world settings. It is imperative that these studies are conducted and reported to the highest standards to enable effective evaluation because they will potentially be a key part of the evidence that is used when deciding whether an AI intervention is sufficiently safe and effective to be approved and commissioned. Minimum reporting guidelines for clinical trial protocols and reports have been instrumental in improving the quality of clinical trials and promoting completeness and transparency of reporting for the evaluation of new health interventions. The current guidelines\u2014SPIRIT and CONSORT\u2014are suited to traditional health interventions but research has revealed that they do not adequately address potential sources of bias specific to AI systems. Examples of elements that require specific reporting include algorithm version and the procedure for acquiring input data. In response, the SPIRIT-AI and CONSORT-AI guidelines were developed by a multidisciplinary group of international experts using a consensus building methodological process. The extensions include a number of new items that should be reported in addition to the core items. Each item, where possible, was informed by challenges identified in existing studies of AI systems in health settings. Conclusion The SPIRIT-AI and CONSORT-AI guidelines provide the first international standards for clinical trials of AI systems. The guidelines are designed to ensure complete and transparent reporting of clinical trial protocols and reports involving AI interventions and have the potential to improve the quality of these clinical trials through improvements in their design and delivery. Their use will help to efficiently identify the safest and most effective AI interventions and commission them with confidence for the benefit of patients and the public.",

      "abstract": "The Circle of Trust is a new conceptual model that can help investigators and the American Indian/Alaska Natives (AI/AN) community work together to promote inclusion of AI/AN populations in clinical trials to improve health outcomes. Racial/ethnic minority groups remain underrepresented in clinical trials and this creates the need and opportunity for novel approaches. Indigenous populations are particularly underrepresented in clinical trials. Studies show that AI/AN have the lowest representation of race/ethnic groups in the United States. American Indian/Alaska Natives suffer from significant health disparities with higher rates of morbidity and mortality and lower rates for preventative measures and access to health services. A variety of barriers to recruitment of minority patients exist at several levels including the system/institutional, interpersonal, and the individual. The authors, experts in AI/AN health and recruitment of minorities into research, collaborated to modify the currently existing and published \u201ctrust triangle\u201d model that focuses on minority recruitment to include participants, researcher, and trusted entity. We advocate for expanding the trust triangle into a circle of trust inclusive of community. The \u201ccircle of trust\u201d is a new conceptual model that can help investigators and the AI/AN community work together to promote inclusion of AI/AN populations in clinical trials to improve health outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Novel and developing artificial intelligence (AI) systems can be integrated into healthcare settings in numerous ways. For example, in the case of automated image classification and natural language processing, AI systems are beginning to demonstrate near expert level performance in detecting abnormalities such as seizure activity. This paper, however, focuses on AI integration into clinical trials. During the clinical trial recruitment process, considerable labor and time is spent sifting through electronic health record and interviewing patients. With the advancement of deep learning techniques such as natural language processing, intricate electronic health record data can be efficiently processed. This provides utility to workflows such as recruitment for clinical trials. Studies are starting to show promise in shortening the time to recruitment and reducing workload for those involved in clinical trial design. Additionally, numerous guidelines are being constructed to encourage integration of AI into the healthcare setting with meaningful impact. The goal would be to improve the clinical trial process by reducing bias in patient composition, improving retention of participants, and lowering costs and labor.",

      "title": "Artificial intelligence-assisted clinical decision support for childhood asthma management: A randomized clinical trial",
      "abstract": "Rationale Clinical decision support (CDS) tools leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) have been an approach for addressing challenges in asthma care but remain under-studied through clinical trials. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and efficiency of Asthma-Guidance and Prediction System (A-GPS), an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted CDS tool, in optimizing asthma management through a randomized clinical trial (RCT). Methods This was a single-center pragmatic RCT with a stratified randomization design conducted for one year in the primary care pediatric practice of the Mayo Clinic, MN. Children (<18 years) diagnosed with asthma receiving care at the study site were enrolled along with their 42 primary care providers. Study subjects were stratified into three strata (based on asthma severity, asthma care status, and asthma diagnosis) and were blinded to the assigned groups. Measurements Intervention was a quarterly A-GPS report to clinicians including relevant clinical information for asthma management from EHRs and machine learning-based prediction for risk of asthma exacerbation (AE). Primary endpoint was the occurrence of AE within 1 year and secondary outcomes included time required for clinicians to review EHRs for asthma management. Main results Out of 555 participants invited to the study, 184 consented for the study and were randomized (90 in intervention and 94 in control group). Median age of 184 participants was 8.5 years. While the proportion of children with AE in both groups decreased from the baseline (P = 0.042), there was no difference in AE frequency between the two groups (12% for the intervention group vs. 15% for the control group, Odds Ratio: 0.82; 95%CI 0.374\u20131.96; P = 0.626) during the study period. For the secondary end points, A-GPS intervention, however, significantly reduced time for reviewing EHRs for asthma management of each participant (median: 3.5 min, IQR: 2\u20135), compared to usual care without A-GPS (median: 11.3 min, IQR: 6.3\u201315); p<0.001). Mean health care costs with 95%CI of children during the trial (compared to before the trial) in the intervention group were lower than those in the control group (-$1,036 [-$2177, $44] for the intervention group vs. +$80 [-$841, $1000] for the control group), though there was no significant difference (p = 0.12). Among those who experienced the first AE during the study period (n = 25), those in the intervention group had timelier follow up by the clinical care team compared to those in the control group but no significant difference was found (HR = 1.93; 95% CI: 0.82\u20131.45, P = 0.10). There was no difference in the proportion of duration when patients had well-controlled asthma during the study period between the intervention and the control groups. Conclusions While A-GPS-based intervention showed similar reduction in AE events to usual care, it might reduce clinicians\u2019 burden for EHRs review resulting in efficient asthma management. A larger RCT is needed for further studying the findings. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02865967.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Artificial intelligence (AI) has been on the rise in the field of pathology. Despite promising results in retrospective studies, and several CE-IVD certified algorithms on the market, prospective clinical implementation studies of AI have yet to be performed, to the best of our knowledge. In this trial, we will explore the benefits of an AI-assisted pathology workflow, while maintaining diagnostic safety standards. Methods and analysis This is a Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials\u2013Artificial Intelligence compliant single-centre, controlled clinical trial, in a fully digital academic pathology laboratory. We will prospectively include prostate cancer patients who undergo prostate needle biopsies (CONFIDENT-P) and breast cancer patients who undergo a sentinel node procedure (CONFIDENT-B) in the University Medical Centre Utrecht. For both the CONFIDENT-B and CONFIDENT-P trials, the specific pathology specimens will be pseudo-randomised to be assessed by a pathologist with or without AI assistance in a pragmatic (bi-)weekly sequential design. In the intervention group, pathologists will assess whole slide images (WSI) of the standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections assisted by the output of the algorithm. In the control group, pathologists will assess H&E WSI according to the current clinical workflow. If no tumour cells are identified or when the pathologist is in doubt, immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining will be performed. At least 80 patients in the CONFIDENT-P and 180 patients in the CONFIDENT-B trial will need to be enrolled to detect superiority, allocated as 1:1. Primary endpoint for both trials is the number of saved resources of IHC staining procedures for detecting tumour cells, since this will clarify tangible cost savings that will support the business case for AI. Ethics and dissemination The ethics committee (MREC NedMec) waived the need of official ethical approval, since participants are not subjected to procedures nor are they required to follow rules. Results of both trials (CONFIDENT-B and CONFIDENT-P) will be published in scientific peer-reviewed journals.",

      "title": "Evaluation of an artificial intelligence-based clinical trial matching system in Chinese patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: a retrospective study",
      "abstract": "Background Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted clinical trial screening is a promising prospect, although previous matching systems were developed in English, and relevant studies have only been conducted in Western countries. Therefore, we evaluated an AI-based clinical trial matching system (CTMS) that extracts medical data from the electronic health record system and matches them to clinical trials automatically. Methods This study included 1,053 consecutive inpatients primarily diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma who were referred to the liver tumor center of an academic medical center in China between January and December 2019. The eligibility criteria extracted from two clinical trials, patient attributes, and gold standard were decided manually. We evaluated the performance of the CTMS against the established gold standard by measuring the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and run time required. Results The manual reviewers demonstrated acceptable interrater reliability (Cohen\u2019s kappa 0.65\u20130.88). The performance results for the CTMS were as follows: accuracy, 92.9\u201398.0%; sensitivity, 51.9\u201383.5%; specificity, 99.0\u201399.1%; PPV, 75.7\u201385.1%; and NPV, 97.4\u201398.9%. The time required for eligibility determination by the CTMS and manual reviewers was 2 and 150 h, respectively. Conclusions We found that the CTMS is particularly reliable in excluding ineligible patients in a significantly reduced amount of time. The CTMS excluded ineligible patients for clinical trials with good performance, reducing 98.7% of the work time. Thus, such AI-based systems with natural language processing and machine learning have potential utility in Chinese clinical trials.

      "abstract": ". Introduction The discovery and generation of effective therapeutics to combat disease lies at the heart of biomedical research. Preclinical studies form the foundation of potential disease treatments, guiding their journey from scientific discovery to impactful patient outcomes. However, over the past two decades, preclinical research has been frequently plagued by the failure to replicate consistent results, costing an estimated $28 billion USD per year (1). Potential therapeutics from preclinical studies entering phase I trials only had a 10.4% approval rate between 2003 and 2014 (2) and an even lower 6% to 7% rate between 2011 and 2017 (3). The disappointing reality of promising preclinical findings that fail to translate into effective therapies has raised serious concerns within the scientific community (4). The cause of this failure is potentially elucidated in a 2015 retrospective analysis of four large biotech companies that showed the most common causes of termination in phase I and II clinical trials since 2003 are the lack of efficacy (60% of all trials) and toxicity (30%) (5). Given these insights and the emergence of advanced technologies that enable large-cohort, in vitro human testing, a pressing need to reassess our approaches to studying human diseases exists. Such changes are vital to facilitating the development of lifesaving therapeutics that can extend both health span and life span by more efficiently [\u2026] Viewpoint",

      "title": "Aromatase inhibitors (letrozole) for ovulation induction in infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome.",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of infrequent periods (oligomenorrhoea) and absence of periods (amenorrhoea). It affects about 5% to 20% of women worldwide and often leads to anovulatory infertility. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are a class of drugs that were introduced for ovulation induction in 2001. Since about 2001 clinical trials have reached differing conclusions as to whether the AI, letrozole, is at least as effective as the first-line treatment clomiphene citrate (CC), a selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM).\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo evaluate the effectiveness and safety of AIs (letrozole) (with or without adjuncts) compared to SERMs (with or without adjuncts) for infertile women with anovulatory PCOS for ovulation induction followed by timed intercourse or intrauterine insemination.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched the following sources, from their inception to 4 November 2021, to identify relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs): the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO. We also checked reference lists of relevant trials, searched the trial registers and contacted experts in the field for any additional trials. We did not restrict the searches by language or publication status.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included all RCTs of AIs used alone or with other medical therapies for ovulation induction in women of reproductive age with anovulatory PCOS.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently selected trials, extracted the data and assessed risks of bias using RoB 1. We pooled trials where appropriate using a fixed-effect model to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for most outcomes, and risk differences (RDs) for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). The primary outcomes were live birth rate and OHSS rate. Secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy, miscarriage and multiple pregnancy rates. We assessed the certainty of the evidence for each comparison using GRADE methods.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nThis is a substantive update of a previous review; of six previously included trials, we excluded four from this update and moved two to 'awaiting classification' due to concerns about validity of trial data. We included five additional trials for this update that now includes a total of 41 RCTs (6522 women). The AI, letrozole, was used in all trials. Letrozole compared to SERMs with or without adjuncts followed by timed intercourse Live birth rates were higher with letrozole (with or without adjuncts) compared to SERMs followed by timed intercourse (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.11; I2 = 0%; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 10; 11 trials, 2060 participants; high-certainty evidence). This suggests that in women with a 20% chance of live birth using SERMs, the live birth rate in women using letrozole with or without adjuncts would be 27% to 35%.\u00a0There is high-certainty evidence that OHSS rates are similar with letrozole or SERMs (0.5% in both arms: risk difference (RD) -0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01; I2 = 0%; 10 trials, 1848 participants; high-certainty evidence). There is evidence for a higher pregnancy rate in favour of letrozole (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.45 to 1.98; I2 = 0%; NNTB = 10; 23 trials, 3321 participants; high-certainty evidence). This suggests that in women with a 24% chance of clinical pregnancy\u00a0using SERMs, the clinical pregnancy rate in women using letrozole with or without adjuncts would be 32%\u00a0to 39%.\u00a0There is little or no difference between treatment groups in the rate of miscarriage per pregnancy (25% with SERMs versus 24% with letrozole: OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.32; I2 = 0%; 15 trials, 736 participants; high-certainty evidence) and multiple pregnancy rate (2.2% with SERMs versus 1.6% with letrozole: OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.32; I2 = 0%; 14 trials, 2247 participants; high-certainty evidence). However, a funnel plot showed mild asymmetry, indicating that some trials in favour of SERMs might be missing.\u00a0 Letrozole compared to laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) One trial reported very low-certainty evidence that live birth rates may be higher with letrozole compared to LOD (OR 2.07, 95% CI 0.99 to 4.32; 1 trial, 141 participants; very low-certainty evidence). This suggests that in women with a 22% chance of live birth using LOD with or without adjuncts, the live birth rate in women using letrozole with or without adjuncts would be 24% to 47%. No trial reported OHSS rates. Due to the low-certainty evidence we are uncertain if letrozole improves pregnancy rates compared to LOD (OR 1.47, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.28; I\u00b2 = 0%; 3 trials, 367 participants; low-certainty evidence). This suggests that in women with a 29% chance of clinical pregnancy using LOD with or without adjuncts, the clinical pregnancy rate in women using letrozole with or without adjuncts would be 28% to 45%. There seems to be no evidence of a difference in miscarriage rates per pregnancy comparing letrozole to LOD (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.92; I\u00b2 = 0%; 3 trials, 122 participants; low-certainty evidence). This also applies to multiple pregnancies (OR 3.00, 95% CI 0.12 to 74.90; 1 trial, 141 participants; very low-certainty evidence).\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nLetrozole appears to improve live birth rates and pregnancy rates in infertile women with anovulatory PCOS, compared to SERMs, when used for ovulation induction, followed by intercourse. There is high-certainty evidence that OHSS rates are similar with letrozole or SERMs. There was high-certainty evidence of no difference in miscarriage rate and multiple pregnancy rate. We are uncertain if letrozole increases live birth rates compared to LOD. In this update, we added good quality trials and removed trials with concerns over data validity, thereby upgrading the certainty of the evidence base.",

      "abstract": "High-quality research is essential in guiding evidence-based care, and should be reported in a way that is reproducible, transparent and where appropriate, provide sufficient detail for inclusion in future meta-analyses. Reporting guidelines for various study designs have been widely used for clinical (and preclinical) studies, consisting of checklists with a minimum set of points for inclusion. With the recent rise in volume of research using artificial intelligence (AI), additional factors need to be evaluated, which do not neatly conform to traditional reporting guidelines (eg, details relating to technical algorithm development). In this review, reporting guidelines are highlighted to promote awareness of essential content required for studies evaluating AI interventions in healthcare. These include published and in progress extensions to well-known reporting guidelines such as Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials-AI (study protocols), Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-AI (randomised controlled trials), Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-AI (diagnostic accuracy studies) and Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis-AI (prediction model studies). Additionally there are a number of guidelines that consider AI for health interventions more generally (eg, Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging (CLAIM), minimum information (MI)-CLAIM, MI for Medical AI Reporting) or address a specific element such as the \u2018learning curve\u2019 (Developmental and Exploratory Clinical Investigation of Decision-AI) . Economic evaluation of AI health interventions is not currently addressed, and may benefit from extension to an existing guideline. In the face of a rapid influx of studies of AI health interventions, reporting guidelines help ensure that investigators and those appraising studies consider both the well-recognised elements of good study design and reporting, while also adequately addressing new challenges posed by AI-specific elements.",

      "title": "Accuracy of an AI-based automated plate reading mobile application for the identification of clinical mastitis-causing pathogens in chromogenic culture media",
      "abstract": "Using on-farm microbiological culture (OFC), based on chromogenic culture media, enables the identification of mastitis causing pathogens in about 24 h, allows rapid decision making on selective treatment and control management measures of cows with clinical mastitis (CM). However, accurate interpretation of OFC results requires trained and experienced operators, which could be a limitation for the use of OFC in dairy farms. Our hypothesis was that AI-based automated plate reading mobile application can analyze images of microorganisms\u2019 colonies in chromogenic culture media with similar diagnostic performance as a trained specialist evaluator. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of an AI-based application (Rumi; OnFarm, Piracicaba, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil) for interpreting images of mastitis causing microorganism colonies grown in chromogenic culture media. For this study two trials were organized to compare the results obtained using an AI-based application Rumi with the interpretation of: (1) a trained specialist, using MALDI-TOF MS as the gold standard; (2) farm personnel users (FPU). In trial 1, a total of 476 CM milk samples, from 11 farms located in S\u00e3o Paulo (n\u2009=\u20097) and Minas Gerais (n\u2009=\u20094), southeast Brazil, were inoculated in chromogenic culture media plates (Smartcolor 2, OnFarm, Piracicaba, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil) by specialists under lab conditions, and digital images were recorded 24 h after incubation at 37 \u00b0C. After that, all the 476 digital images were analyzed by the Rumi and by another specialist (who only had access to the digital images) and the diagnostic accuracy indicators sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) were calculated using MALDI-TOF MS microbiological identification of the isolates as the reference. In Trial 2, a total of 208 CM milk samples, from 150 farms from Brazil, were inoculated in chromogenic culture media plates by FPU, and the results of microbiological growth were visually interpreted by FPU under on-farm conditions. After visual interpretation, results were recorded using an OnFarmApp application (herd manage application for mastitis by OnFarm, Piracicaba, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil), and the images of the chromogenic culture plates were captured by the OnFarmApp to be evaluated by Rumi and Bayesian Latent Class Models were performed to compare Rumi and the FPU. In Trial 1, Rumi presented high and intermediate accuracy results, with the only exception of the low Enterococcus spp.\u2019s Se. In comparison with the specialist, Rumi performed similarly in Se and Sp for most groups of pathogens, with the only exception of non-aureus staphylococci where Se results were lower. Both Rumi and the specialist achieved Sp results\u2009>\u20090.96. In Trial 2, Rumi had similar results as the FPU in the Bayesian Latent Class Model analysis. In conclusion, the use of the AI-based automated plate reading mobile application can be an alternative for visual interpretation of OFC results, simplifying the procedures for selective treatment decisions for CM based on OFC.",

      "abstract": "The first few months of 2020 have profoundly changed the way we live our lives and carry out our daily activities. Although the widespread use of futuristic robotaxis and self-driving commercial vehicles has not yet become a reality, the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically accelerated the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in different fields. We have witnessed the equivalent of two years of digital transformation compressed into just a few months. Whether it is in tracing epidemiological peaks or in transacting contactless payments, the impact of these developments has been almost immediate, and a window has opened up on what is to come. Here we analyze and discuss how AI can support us in facing the ongoing pandemic. Despite the numerous and undeniable contributions of AI, clinical trials and human skills are still required. Even if different strategies have been developed in different states worldwide, the fight against the pandemic seems to have found everywhere a valuable ally in AI, a global and open-source tool capable of providing assistance in this health emergency. A careful AI application would enable us to operate within this complex scenario involving healthcare, society and research.",

In the future, the development of a new endoscopic scoring system based on AI might standardize the definition of MH.

      "abstract": "Abstract The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) led to multiple drug repurposing clinical trials that have yielded largely uncertain outcomes. To overcome this challenge, we used IDentif.AI, a platform that pairs experimental validation with artificial intelligence (AI) and digital drug development to rapidly pinpoint unpredictable drug interactions and optimize infectious disease combination therapy design with clinically relevant dosages. IDentif.AI was paired with a 12\u2010drug candidate therapy set representing over 530,000 drug combinations against the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 live virus collected from a patient sample. IDentif.AI pinpointed the optimal combination as remdesivir, ritonavir, and lopinavir, which was experimentally validated to mediate a 6.5\u2010fold enhanced efficacy over remdesivir alone. Additionally, it showed hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to be relatively ineffective. The study was completed within 2\u2009weeks, with a three\u2010order of magnitude reduction in the number of tests needed. IDentif.AI independently mirrored clinical trial outcomes to date without any data from these trials. The robustness of this digital drug development approach paired with in vitro experimentation and AI\u2010driven optimization suggests that IDentif.AI may be clinically actionable toward current and future outbreaks.",

To realize the promise of AI in healthcare, there is a need for designing systems that can capture patient heterogeneity and relevant biomedical knowledge. Here we present PlaNet, a geometric deep learning framework that reasons over population variability, disease biology, and drug chemistry by representing knowledge in the form of a massive clinical knowledge graph that can be enhanced by language models. Our framework is applicable to any sub-population, any drug as well drug combinations, any disease, and to a wide range of pharmacological tasks. We apply the PlaNet framework to reason about outcomes of clinical trials: PlaNet predicts drug efficacy and adverse events, even for experimental drugs and their combinations that have never been seen by the model. Furthermore, PlaNet can estimate the effect of changing population on the trial outcome with direct implications on patient stratification in clinical trials. PlaNet takes fundamental steps towards AI-guided clinical trials design, offering valuable guidance for realizing the vision of precision medicine using AI.",

The fast progress in this field poses the need to define new approaches and methods to support an agile and structured assessment process. The assessment of key information, characteristics and challenges deriving from the application of ML tools in CTs and their link with the principles for a trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) that directly affect the decision-making process is investigated. Potential issues are identified during the assessment and areas of greater interaction combining key regulatory points and principles for a trustworthy AI are highlighted. The most impacted areas are those related to technical robustness and safety of the ML tool, in relation to data used and the level of evidence generated. Additional areas of attention emerged, like the ones related to data and algorithm transparency. We evaluate the applicability of a new method to further support the assessment of medicinal products developed using data-driven tools in a CT setting. This is a first step and new paradigms should be adopted to support policy makers and regulatory decisions, capitalizing on technology advancements, considering stakeholders\u2019 feedback and still ensuring a regulatory framework on safety and efficacy.",

AI provides broad utility options through structured, standardised, and digitally driven elements in medical research. The clinical trials are a time-consuming process with patient recruitment, enrolment, frequent monitoring, and medical adherence and retention. With an AI-powered tool, the automated data can be generated and managed for the trial lifecycle with all the records of the medical history of the patient as patient-centric AI. AI can intelligently interpret the data, feed downstream systems, and automatically fill out the required analysis report. This article explains how AI has revolutionised innovative ways of collecting data, biosimulation, and early disease diagnosis for clinical trials and overcomes the challenges more precisely through cost and time reduction, improved efficiency, and improved drug development research with less need for rework. The future implications of AI to accelerate clinical trials are important in medical research because of its fast output and overall utility.",

      "abstract": "Background Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) play an important role in the endocrine therapy of postmenopausal breast cancer patients, with a recent tendency to extend the duration of their use. However, AIs may increase the risk of osteoporotic bone fractures. This meta-analysis evaluated the risk of osteoporotic fractures of the hip, spine, and other locations in breast cancer patients using AIs. Methods We performed a systematic search to identify randomized controlled clinical trials that investigated osteoporotic fractures in breast cancer patients on AI therapy. The main outcomes were the incidence and risk of osteoporotic fractures in general and of hip, vertebral, and non-vertebral fractures in AI users and controls. Results The systematic review found a total of 30 randomized controlled trials including 117,974 participants. The meta-analysis showed a higher incidence of osteoporotic fracture in AI users: The crude risk ratio for all osteoporotic fractures was 1.35 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.29\u20131.42; P < 0.001), for hip fractures 1.18 (95% CI, 1.02\u20131.35; P < 0.001), for vertebral fractures 1.84 (95% CI, 1.36\u20132.49; P < 0.001), and for non-vertebral fractures 1.18 (95% CI, 1.02\u20131.35; P < 0.001), respectively, compared to the controls. Conclusion Our meta-analysis suggested an increased risk of osteoporotic fractures for AI therapy in patients with breast cancer that was most expressed for vertebral fractures. Breast cancer patients on AIs need to be monitored for osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures, and active prevention measures should be implemented.",

      "abstract": "Since U.S. President Barack Obama announced the Precision Medicine Initiative in his New Year\u2019s State of the Union address in 2015, the establishment of a precision medicine system has been emphasized worldwide, particularly in the field of oncology. With the advent of next-generation sequencers specifically, genome analysis technology has made remarkable progress, and there are active efforts to apply genome information to diagnosis and treatment. Generally, in the process of feeding back the results of next-generation sequencing analysis to patients, a molecular tumor board (MTB), consisting of experts in clinical oncology, genetic medicine, etc., is established to discuss the results. On the other hand, an MTB currently involves a large amount of work, with humans searching through vast databases and literature, selecting the best drug candidates, and manually confirming the status of available clinical trials. In addition, as personalized medicine advances, the burden on MTB members is expected to increase in the future. Under these circumstances, introducing cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) technology and information and communication technology to MTBs while reducing the burden on MTB members and building a platform that enables more accurate and personalized medical care would be of great benefit to patients. In this review, we introduced the latest status of elemental technologies that have potential for AI utilization in MTB, and discussed issues that may arise in the future as we progress with AI implementation.",

      "abstract": "Due to the increasing demand for intensive care unit (ICU) treatment, and to improve quality and efficiency of care, there is a need for adequate and efficient clinical decision-making. The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has resulted in the development of prediction models, which might aid clinical decision-making. This systematic review seeks to give a contemporary overview of the current maturity of AI in the ICU, the research methods behind these studies, and the risk of bias in these studies. A systematic search was conducted in Embase, Medline, Web of Science Core Collection and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases to identify eligible studies. Studies using AI to analyze ICU data were considered eligible. Specifically, the study design, study aim, dataset size, level of validation, level of readiness, and the outcomes of clinical trials were extracted. Risk of bias in individual studies was evaluated by the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST). Out of 6455 studies identified through literature search, 494 were included. The most common study design was retrospective [476 studies (96.4% of all studies)] followed by prospective observational [8 (1.6%)] and clinical [10 (2%)] trials. 378 (80.9%) retrospective studies were classified as high risk of bias. No studies were identified that reported on the outcome evaluation of an AI model integrated in routine clinical practice. The vast majority of developed ICU-AI models remain within the testing and prototyping environment; only a handful were actually evaluated in clinical practice. A uniform and structured approach can support the development, safe delivery, and implementation of AI to determine clinical benefit in the ICU.",

      "abstract": "The pharmaceutical industry has seen a lot of transformation in the last five years because of technological innovations such as AI. AI-based technologies such as ML and DL are revolutionizing the sector and making processes such as drug discovery, research, dose optimization, therapeutic drug monitoring, drug repurposing, predictive analytics, and clinical trials much easier. Drug development is a complex, time consuming, and labor-intensive process. In some instances, drug development takes up to 10 years and a significant amount of investment. However, AI-based technologies are showing a lot of promise when it comes to simplifying the process and making it less-time consuming. The drug development involves a lot of data. AI-based technologies such as ML shows a lot of promise when it comes to analyzing and managing these large volumes of data making the process more manageable. AI has also simplified the process of identifying therapeutic targets. AI is also being used in drug design to help in making predictions of 3D structure of the target protein and predict drug-protein interactions. Other areas where AI is being used in drug discovery are de novo drug design, optimizing clinical trials, predictive modelling, and precision medicine. Despite the advantages that AI offers in pharma, it has its limitations. For instance, ethical considerations regarding patient data, privacy, and confidentiality remains a key issue. Risk of bias also raises ethical concerns that should be considered. Other limitations are limited skills that make it difficult to optimize AI, financial limitations that make it difficult to invest in AI, and data governance challenges. \nKeywords: Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), drug discovery, clinical trials",

      "abstract": "Background Evaluation of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in clinical trials remains the gold standard for translation into clinical settings. However, design factors associated with successful trial completion and the common reasons for trial failure are unknown. Objective This study aims to compare trial design factors of complete and incomplete clinical trials testing AI tools. We conducted a case-control study of complete (n=485) and incomplete (n=51) clinical trials that evaluated AI as an intervention of ClinicalTrials.gov. Methods Trial design factors, including area of clinical application, intended use population, and intended role of AI, were extracted. Trials that did not evaluate AI as an intervention and active trials were excluded. The assessed trial design factors related to AI interventions included the domain of clinical application related to organ systems; intended use population for patients or health care providers; and the role of AI for different applications in patient-facing clinical workflows, such as diagnosis, screening, and treatment. In addition, we also assessed general trial design factors including study type, allocation, intervention model, masking, age, sex, funder, continent, length of time, sample size, number of enrollment sites, and study start year. The main outcome was the completion of the clinical trial. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI values were calculated for all trial design factors using propensity-matched, multivariable logistic regression. Results We queried ClinicalTrials.gov on December 23, 2023, using AI keywords to identify complete and incomplete trials testing AI technologies as a primary intervention, yielding 485 complete and 51 incomplete trials for inclusion in this study. Our nested propensity-matched, case-control results suggest that trials conducted in Europe were significantly associated with trial completion when compared with North American trials (OR 2.85, 95% CI 1.14-7.10; P=.03), and the trial sample size was positively associated with trial completion (OR 1.00, 95% CI 1.00-1.00; P=.02). Conclusions Our case-control study is one of the first to identify trial design factors associated with completion of AI trials and catalog study-reported reasons for AI trial failure. We observed that trial design factors positively associated with trial completion include trials conducted in Europe and sample size. Given the promising clinical use of AI tools in health care, our results suggest that future translational research should prioritize addressing the design factors of AI clinical trials associated with trial incompletion and common reasons for study failure.",

      "abstract": "Objective: Clinical trials are the most effective way to judge the merits of diagnosis and treatment strategies. The in-depth mining of clinical trial data enables us to grasp the application trend of artificial intelligence (AI) for cancer diagnosis. The aim of this study was to analyze the characteristics of registered trials on AI for cancer diagnosis. Methods: Clinical trials on AI for cancer diagnosis registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov database were searched and downloaded. Statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS 20.0 software. Results: A total of 97 registered trials were included. Of them, only 27 (27.8%) were interventional trials and 70 (72.1%) were observational trials. Fifteen (15.4%) trials had been completed. Fifty trials were in recruitment, and another 18 remained unrecruited. The number of cases included in the clinical trials tended to be large, 31 (32.0%) trials including samples ranging from 100 to 499 cases and 17 (17.5%) trials including samples ranging from 500 to 999 cases. Of the 27 interventional trials, only two trials reported trials' phase. Most (85.2%) interventional trials were for diagnosis, and a few (3.7%) were for the purpose of both the diagnosis and therapy of cancers. For the observational clinical trials, 46 (65.7%) were cohort studies, and 11 (15.7%) were case-only studies. Among the observational trials, 46 (65.7%) were prospective studies and 13 (18.6%) were retrospective studies. Among 97 trials, 37 (38.1%) involved colorectal cancer, 11 (11.3%) involved breast cancer, 43 (44.3%) were for imaging diagnosis, 33 (34.0%) were for endoscopic diagnosis, and 11 (11.3%) were for pathological diagnosis. For the interventional trials, 11 trials were parallel assignment (40.7%), and 14 were single group assignment (51.9%). Among the 27 interventional trials, 18 (66.7%) trials were performed without masking, 6 (22.2%) trials were performed with single masking, only 1 (3.7%) was performed with double masking, and 2 (7.4%) was performed with triple masking. Conclusion: It appears that most registered trials on AI for cancer diagnosis are observational design, and more trials are needed in this field.",

      "abstract": "This study aims to develop explainable AI methods for matching patients with phase 1 oncology clinical trials using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to address challenges in patient recruitment for improved efficiency in drug development. A prototype system based on modern NLP techniques has been developed to match patient records with phase 1 oncology clinical trial protocols. Four criteria are considered for the matching: cancer type, performance status, genetic mutation, and measurable disease. The system outputs a summary matching score along with explanations of the evidence. The outputs of the AI system were evaluated against the ground truth matching results provided by the domain expert on a dataset of twelve synthesized dummy patient records and six clinical trial protocols. The system achieved a precision of 73.68%, sensitivity/recall of 56%, accuracy of 77.78%, and specificity of 89.36%. Further investigation into the misclassified cases indicated that ambiguity of abbreviation and misunderstanding of context are significant contributors to errors. The system found evidence of no matching for all false positive cases. To the best of our knowledge, no system in the public domain currently deploys an explainable AI-based approach to identify optimal patients for phase 1 oncology trials. This initial attempt to develop an AI system for patients and clinical trial matching in the context of phase 1 oncology trials showed promising results that are set to increase efficiency without sacrificing quality in patient-trial matching.",

      "abstract": "Simple Summary Immune checkpoint inhibitors have improved the prognosis for patients with advanced melanoma. Despite the recent success of immunotherapy, many patients still do not benefit from these treatments, and their real-life application may yield different outcomes compared to the advantage presented in clinical trials. There is therefore a need to select patients who can really benefit from these treatments. We have focused our study on a real-life retrospective analysis of metastatic melanoma patients treated with immunotherapy at a single institution\u2014the Istituto Nazionale Tumori IRCCS Fondazione \u201cG. Pascale\u201d of Napoli, Italy. With the help of AI and machine learning we validated an algorithm based on clinical variables of patients\u2014namely, the Clinical Categorization Algorithm (CLICAL)\u2014that defines five predictable cohorts of benefit to immunotherapy with 95% accuracy. It can be a useful tool for the stratification of metastatic melanoma patients who may or may not improve from immunotherapy treatment. Abstract The real-life application of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) may yield different outcomes compared to the benefit presented in clinical trials. For this reason, there is a need to define the group of patients that may benefit from treatment. We retrospectively investigated 578 metastatic melanoma patients treated with ICIs at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori IRCCS Fondazione \u201cG. Pascale\u201d of Napoli, Italy (INT-NA). To compare patients\u2019 clinical variables (i.e., age, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), neutrophil\u2013lymphocyte ratio (NLR), eosinophil, BRAF status, previous treatment) and their predictive and prognostic power in a comprehensive, non-hierarchical manner, a clinical categorization algorithm (CLICAL) was defined and validated by the application of a machine learning algorithm\u2014survival random forest (SRF-CLICAL). The comprehensive analysis of the clinical parameters by log risk-based algorithms resulted in predictive signatures that could identify groups of patients with great benefit or not, regardless of the ICI received. From a real-life retrospective analysis of metastatic melanoma patients, we generated and validated an algorithm based on machine learning that could assist with the clinical decision of whether or not to apply ICI therapy by defining five signatures of predictability with 95% accuracy.",

      "title": "Enhancing Patient Selection in Sepsis Clinical Trials Design Through an AI Enrichment Strategy: Algorithm Development and Validation",
      "abstract": "Background Sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome, and enrollment of more homogeneous patients is essential to improve the efficiency of clinical trials. Artificial intelligence (AI) has facilitated the identification of homogeneous subgroups, but how to estimate the uncertainty of the model outputs when applying AI to clinical decision-making remains unknown. Objective We aimed to design an AI-based model for purposeful patient enrollment, ensuring that a patient with sepsis recruited into a trial would still be persistently ill by the time the proposed therapy could impact patient outcome. We also expected that the model could provide interpretable factors and estimate the uncertainty of the model outputs at a customized confidence level. Methods In this retrospective study, 9135 patients with sepsis requiring vasopressor treatment within 24 hours after sepsis onset were enrolled from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. This cohort was used for model development, and 10-fold cross-validation with 50 repeats was used for internal validation. In total, 3743 patients with sepsis from the eICU Collaborative Research Database were used as the external validation cohort. All included patients with sepsis were stratified based on disease progression trajectories: rapid death, recovery, and persistent ill. A total of 148 variables were selected for predicting the 3 trajectories. Four machine learning algorithms with 3 different setups were used. We estimated the uncertainty of the model outputs using conformal prediction (CP). The Shapley Additive Explanations method was used to explain the model. Results The multiclass gradient boosting machine was identified as the best-performing model with good discrimination and calibration performance in both validation cohorts. The mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with SD was 0.906 (0.018) for rapid death, 0.843 (0.008) for recovery, and 0.807 (0.010) for persistent ill in the internal validation cohort. In the external validation cohort, the mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (SD) was 0.878 (0.003) for rapid death, 0.764 (0.008) for recovery, and 0.696 (0.007) for persistent ill. The maximum norepinephrine equivalence, total urine output, Acute Physiology Score III, mean systolic blood pressure, and the coefficient of variation of oxygen saturation contributed the most. Compared to the model without CP, using the model with CP at a mixed confidence approach reduced overall prediction errors by 27.6% (n=62) and 30.7% (n=412) in the internal and external validation cohorts, respectively, as well as enabled the identification of more potentially persistent ill patients. Conclusions The implementation of our model has the potential to reduce heterogeneity and enroll more homogeneous patients in sepsis clinical trials. The use of CP for estimating the uncertainty of the model outputs allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the model\u2019s reliability and assists in making informed decisions based on the predicted outcomes.",

Patients treated with the combination of the CDK4/6i palbociclib+the\u2009ICI pembrolizumab+the aromatase inhibitor (AI) letrozole (palbo+pembro+AI) were compared with patients treated with pembrolizumab+AI (pembro+AI). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected at pretreatment, 3 weeks (cycle 2\u2009day 1) and 9 weeks (cycle 4\u2009day 1) were characterized by high-parameter flow cytometry to assess baseline immune subset composition and longitudinal changes in response to therapy. Results In the peripheral blood, higher pretreatment frequencies of effector memory CD45RA+ CD8+ T cells and effector memory CD4+ T cells were observed in responders to palbo+pembro+AI. In contrast, this was not observed in pembro+AI-treated patients. We further characterized T-cell subsets of effector-like killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily G member 1 (KLRG1+) ICOS+ CD4+ T cells and KLRG1+ CD45RA+ CD8+ T cells as baseline biomarkers of response. In comparison, pretreatment levels of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte, tumor mutation burden, tumor programmed death-ligand 1 expression, and overall immune composition did not associate with clinical responses. Over the course of treatment, significant shifts in myeloid cell composition and phenotype were observed in palbo+pembro+AI-treated patients, but not in those treated with pembro+AI. We identified increased fractions of type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) within circulating dendritic cells and decreased classical monocytes (cMO) within circulating monocytes only in patients treated with palbociclib. We also demonstrated that in palbociclib-treated patients, cDC1 and cMO displayed increased CD83 and human leukocyte antigen-DR isotype (HLA-DR) expression, respectively, suggesting increased maturation and antigen presentation capacity. Conclusions Pre-existing circulating effector CD8+ and\u2009CD4+ T cells and dynamic modulation of circulating myeloid cell composition denote response to combined pembrolizumab and palbociclib therapy for patients with HR+ MBC.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nArtificial intelligence (AI) applications are growing at an unprecedented pace in health care, including disease diagnosis, triage or screening, risk analysis, surgical operations, and so forth. Despite a great deal of research in the development and validation of health care AI, only few applications have been actually implemented at the frontlines of clinical practice.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this study was to systematically review AI applications that have been implemented in real-life clinical practice.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a literature search in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central, and CINAHL to identify relevant articles published between January 2010 and May 2020. We also hand searched premier computer science journals and conferences as well as registered clinical trials. Studies were included if they reported AI applications that had been implemented in real-world clinical settings.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe identified 51 relevant studies that reported the implementation and evaluation of AI applications in clinical practice, of which 13 adopted a randomized controlled trial design and eight adopted an experimental design. The AI applications targeted various clinical tasks, such as screening or triage (n=16), disease diagnosis (n=16), risk analysis (n=14), and treatment (n=7). The most commonly addressed diseases and conditions were sepsis (n=6), breast cancer (n=5), diabetic retinopathy (n=4), and polyp and adenoma (n=4). Regarding the evaluation outcomes, we found that 26 studies examined the performance of AI applications in clinical settings, 33 studies examined the effect of AI applications on clinician outcomes, 14 studies examined the effect on patient outcomes, and one study examined the economic impact associated with AI implementation.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis review indicates that research on the clinical implementation of AI applications is still at an early stage despite the great potential. More research needs to assess the benefits and challenges associated with clinical AI applications through a more rigorous methodology.",

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a subfield of computer science focused on developing systems that can execute tasks traditionally associated with human intelligence. AI systems work through algorithms based on rules or instructions that enable the machine to make decisions. With the advancement of science, more sophisticated AI techniques, such as machine learning and deep learning, have been developed, allowing machines to learn from large amounts of data and improve their performance over time. The pharmaceutical industry has greatly benefited from the development of this technology. AI has revolutionized drug discovery and development by enabling rapid and effective analysis of vast volumes of biological and chemical data during the identification of new therapeutic compounds. The algorithms developed can predict the efficacy, toxicity, and possible adverse effects of new drugs, optimize the steps involved in clinical trials, reduce associated time and costs, and facilitate the implementation of innovative drugs in the market, making it easier to develop precise therapies tailored to the individual genetic profile of patients. Despite significant advancements, there are still gaps in the application of AI, particularly due to the lack of comprehensive regulation. The constant evolution of this technology requires ongoing and in-depth legislative oversight to ensure its use remains safe, ethical, and free from bias. This review explores the role of AI in drug development, assessing its potential to enhance formulation, accelerate discovery, and repurpose existing medications. It highlights AI\u2019s impact across all stages, from initial research to clinical trials, emphasizing its ability to optimize processes, drive innovation, and improve therapeutic outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Just like your phone can detect what song is playing in crowded spaces, we show that Artificial Intelligence transfer learning algorithms trained on cough phone recordings results in diagnostic tests for COVID-19. To gain adoption by the health care community, we plan to validate our results in a clinical trial and three other venues in Mexico, Spain and the USA . However, if we had data from other on-going clinical trials and volunteers, we may do much more. For example, for confirmed stay-at-home COVID-19 patients, a longitudinal audio test could be developed to determine contact-with-hospital recommendations, and for the most critical COVID-19 patients a success ratio forecast test, including patient clinical data, to prioritize ICU allocation. As a challenge to the engineering community and in the context of our clinical trial, the authors suggest distributing cough recordings daily, hoping other trials and crowdsourcing users will contribute more data. Previous approaches to complex AI tasks have either used a static dataset or were private efforts led by large corporations. All existing COVID-19 trials published also follow this paradigm. Instead, we suggest a novel open collective approach to large-scale real-time health care AI. We will be posting updates at this https URL. Our personal view is that our approach is the right one for large scale pandemics, and therefore is here to stay - will you join?",

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of AI-related trials in healthcare based on ClinicalTrials.gov, intending to investigate the trial characteristics and AI\u2019s development status. Additionally, the Neo4j graph database and visualization technology were employed to construct an AI technology application graph, achieving a visual representation and analysis of research hotspots in healthcare AI. A total of 1725 eligible trials that were registered in ClinicalTrials.gov up to 31 March 2022 were included in this study. The number of trial registrations has dramatically grown each year since 2016. However, the AI-related trials had some design drawbacks and problems with poor-quality result reporting. The proportion of trials with prospective and randomized designs was insufficient, and most studies did not report results upon completion. Currently, most healthcare AI application studies are based on data-driven learning algorithms, covering various disease areas and healthcare scenarios. As few studies have publicly reported results on ClinicalTrials.gov, there is not enough evidence to support an assessment of AI\u2019s actual performance. The widespread implementation of AI technology in healthcare still faces many challenges and requires more high-quality prospective clinical validation.",

However, little is known about the current status of trials on artificial intelligence (AI) conducted in emergency department and intensive care unit. The objective of the study was to provide a comprehensive analysis of registered trials in such field based on ClinicalTrials.gov. Methods: Registered trials on AI conducted in emergency department and intensive care unit were searched on ClinicalTrials.gov up to 12th January 2021. The characteristics were analyzed using SPSS21.0 software. Results: A total of 146 registered trials were identified, including 61 in emergency department and 85 in intensive care unit. They were registered from 2004 to 2021. Regarding locations, 58 were conducted in Europe, 58 in America, 9 in Asia, 4 in Australia, and 17 did not report locations. The enrollment of participants was from 0 to 18,000,000, with a median of 233. Universities were the primary sponsors, which accounted for 43.15%, followed by hospitals (35.62%), and industries/companies (9.59%). Regarding study designs, 85 trials were interventional trials, while 61 were observational trials. Of the 85 interventional trials, 15.29% were for diagnosis and 38.82% for treatment; of the 84 observational trials, 42 were prospective, 14 were retrospective, 2 were cross-sectional, 2 did not report clear information and 1 was unknown. Regarding the trials' results, 69 trials had been completed, while only 10 had available results on ClinicalTrials.gov. Conclusions: Our study suggest that more AI trials are needed in emergency department and intensive care unit and sponsors are encouraged to report the results.",

      "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the disruptive potential to transform patients\u2019 lives via innovations in pharmaceutical sciences, drug development, clinical trials, and manufacturing. However, it presents significant challenges, ethical concerns, and risks across sectors and societies. AI\u2019s rapid advancement has revealed regulatory gaps as existing public policies struggle to keep pace with the challenges posed by these emerging technologies. The term AI itself has become commonplace to argue that greater \u201chuman oversight\u201d for \u201cmachine intelligence\u201d is needed to harness the power of this revolutionary technology for both potential and risk management, and hence to call for more practical regulatory guidelines, harmonized frameworks, and effective policies to ensure safety, scalability, data privacy, and governance, transparency, and equitable treatment. In this review paper, we employ a holistic multidisciplinary lens to survey the current regulatory landscape with a synopsis of the FDA workshop perspectives on the use of AI in drug and biological product development. We discuss the promises of responsible data-driven AI, challenges and related practices adopted to overcome limitations, and our practical reflections on regulatory oversight. Finally, the paper outlines a path forward and future opportunities for lawful ethical AI. This review highlights the importance of risk-based regulatory oversight, including diverging regulatory views in the field, in reaching a consensus.",

      "abstract": "Healthcare, one of the most important industries, is data-oriented, but most of the research in this industry focuses on incorporating the internet of things (IoT) or connecting medical equipment. Very few researchers are looking at the data generated in the healthcare industry. Data are very important tools in this competitive world, as they can be integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) to promote sustainability. Healthcare data include the health records of patients, drug-related data, clinical trials data, data from various medical equipment, etc. Most of the data management processes are manual, time-consuming, and error-prone. Even then, different healthcare industries do not trust each other to share and collaborate on data. Distributed ledger technology is being used for innovations in different sectors including healthcare. This technology can be incorporated to maintain and exchange data between different healthcare organizations, such as hospitals, insurance companies, laboratories, pharmacies, etc. Various attributes of this technology, such as its immutability, transparency, provenance etc., can bring trust and security to the domain of the healthcare sector. In this paper, a decentralized access control model is proposed to enable the secure interoperability of different healthcare organizations. This model uses the Ethereum blockchain for its implementation. This model interfaces patients, doctors, chemists, and insurance companies, empowering the consistent and secure exchange of data. The major concerns are maintaining a history of the transactions and avoiding unauthorized updates in health records. Any transaction that changes the state of the data is reflected in the distributed ledger and can be easily traced with this model. Only authorized entities can access their respective data. Even the administrator will not be able to modify any medical records.",

      "title": "Artificial intelligence applications in intensity modulated radiation treatment planning: an overview.",
      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to methods that improve and automate challenging human tasks by systematically capturing and applying relevant knowledge in these tasks. Over the past decades, a number of approaches have been developed to address different types and needs of system intelligence ranging from search strategies to knowledge representation and inference to robotic planning. In the context of radiation treatment planning, multiple AI approaches may be adopted to improve the planning quality and efficiency. For example, knowledge representation and inference methods may improve dose prescription by integrating and reasoning about the domain knowledge described in many clinical guidelines and clinical trials reports. In this review, we will focus on the most studied AI approach in intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)/volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT)-machine learning (ML) and describe our recent efforts in applying ML to improve the quality, consistency, and efficiency of IMRT/VMAT planning. With the available high-quality data, we can build models to accurately predict critical variables for each step of the planning process and thus automate and improve its outcomes. Specific to the IMRT/VMAT planning process, we can build models for each of the four critical components in the process: dose-volume histogram (DVH), Dose, Fluence, and Human Planner. These models can be divided into two general groups. The first group focuses on encoding prior experience and knowledge through ML and more recently deep learning (DL) from prior clinical plans and using these models to predict the optimal DVH (DVH prediction model), or 3D dose distribution (dose prediction model), or fluence map (fluence map model). The goal of these models is to reduce or remove the trial-and-error process and guarantee consistently high-quality plans. The second group of models focuses on mimicking human planners' decision-making process (planning strategy model) during the iterative adjustments/guidance of the optimization engine. Each critical step of the IMRT/VMAT treatment planning process can be improved and automated by AI methods. As more training data becomes available and more sophisticated models are developed, we can expect that the AI methods in treatment planning will continue to improve accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.",

      "title": "Development and validation of an AI-derived digital pathology-based biomarker to predict benefit of long-term androgen deprivation therapy with radiotherapy in men with localized high-risk prostate cancer across multiple phase III NRG/RTOG trials.",
      "abstract": "5001 Background: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) improves survival and reduces risk of metastasis in men with high-risk localized prostate cancer (PC) receiving radiotherapy (RT). Predictive biomarkers are needed to guide ADT duration to maximize benefits and minimize risks. We sought to train and validate the first predictive biomarker for long-term (LT) vs short-term (ST) ADT using multiple phase III NRG Oncology randomized trials. Methods: Pre-treatment prostate biopsy slides were digitized from six phase III NRG/RTOG randomized trials of men receiving RT +/- ADT. The artificial intelligence (AI)-derived clinical and histopathological predictive biomarker was trained on RTOG 9408, 9413, 9902, 9910, and 0521 to predict differential benefit of LTADT on distant metastasis (DM). After the AI biomarker was locked, it was validated on RTOG 9202, which randomized men to RT + STADT (4 mo) vs LTADT (28 mo). The predictive utility of the AI biomarker was evaluated for the primary and secondary endpoints of DM and PC-specific mortality (PCSM), respectively, for ADT duration with Fine-Gray interaction models. Event rates were estimated by the cumulative incidence method. Deaths from other causes were treated as competing risks. Results: The AI-derived biomarker was trained on 2,641 men (median follow-up of 9.8 years, IQR [8.2, 11.5]) and validated on 1,192 men from RTOG 9202 (median follow-up of 17.2 years, IQR [9.1, 19.6]), where 80% had at least one high/very high (H/VH) risk feature (cT3-4, Gleason 8-10, PSA > 20, or primary Gleason pattern 5). Consistent with published results, LTADT significantly improved DM (subdistribution HR [sHR] 0.64, 95% CI 0.50-0.82, p < 0.001) in the validation cohort. The AI biomarker was prognostic for DM (sHR 2.35, 95% CI 1.72-3.19, p < 0.001). A significant biomarker-treatment interaction was observed (p = 0.04), in which AI-biomarker (+) men (n = 785, 66%) had reduced DM with LTADT (sHR 0.55, 95% CI 0.41-0.73, p < 0.001), but no benefit was observed (sHR 1.06, 95% CI 0.61-1.84, p = 0.84) for AI-biomarker (-) men (n = 407, 34%). The 10-year DM rate difference between RT + LTADT vs RT + STADT was 13% in AI-biomarker (+) men vs 2% in AI-biomarker (-) men. Similar trends were observed for PCSM outcomes. Risk classification (NCCN intermediate [n = 221, 43% (+)] vs other H/VH risk [n = 954, 71% (+)]) was prognostic but not predictive of LTADT benefit. Conclusions: We have successfully validated the first predictive biomarker of LTADT benefit with RT in localized high-risk PC using an AI-derived digital pathology-based platform in the phase III NRG/RTOG 9202 trial. The predictive AI biomarker identified 34% of men that could derive similar benefit with STADT, avoiding the side effects of prolonged ADT, and 43% of intermediate risk men who would benefit from LTADT.",

      "abstract": "Accurate prediction of recurrence and progression in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is essential to inform management and eligibility for clinical trials. Despite substantial interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) applications in NMIBC, their clinical readiness remains unclear. This systematic review aimed to critically appraise AI studies predicting NMIBC outcomes, and to identify common methodological and reporting pitfalls. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched from inception to February 5th, 2024 for AI studies predicting NMIBC recurrence or progression. APPRAISE-AI was used to assess methodological and reporting quality of these studies. Performance between AI and non-AI approaches included within these studies were compared. A total of 15 studies (five on recurrence, four on progression, and six on both) were included. All studies were retrospective, with a median follow-up of 71 months (IQR 32\u221293) and median cohort size of 125 (IQR 93\u2212309). Most studies were low quality, with only one classified as high quality. While AI models generally outperformed non-AI approaches with respect to accuracy, c-index, sensitivity, and specificity, this margin of benefit varied with study quality (median absolute performance difference was 10 for low, 22 for moderate, and 4 for high quality studies). Common pitfalls included dataset limitations, heterogeneous outcome definitions, methodological flaws, suboptimal model evaluation, and reproducibility issues. Recommendations to address these challenges are proposed. These findings emphasise the need for collaborative efforts between urological and AI communities paired with rigorous methodologies to develop higher quality models, enabling AI to reach its potential in enhancing NMIBC care.",

      "abstract": "Background: Many clinical trials with potential drug treatment options for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are focused on patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) stages 2 and 3 fibrosis. As the histological features differentiating stage 1 (F1) from stage 2 (F2) NASH fibrosis are subtle, some patients may be wrongly staged by the in-house pathologist and miss the opportunity for enrollment into clinical trials. We hypothesized that our refined artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithm (qFibrosis) can identify these subtle differences and serve as an assistive tool for in-house pathologists. Methods: Liver tissue from 160 adult patients with biopsy-proven NASH from Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and Peking University People\u2019s Hospital (PKUH) were used. A consensus read by two expert hepatopathologists was organized. The refined qFibrosis algorithm incorporated the creation of a periportal region that allowed for the increased detection of periportal fibrosis. Consequently, an additional 28 periportal parameters were added, and 28 pre-existing perisinusoidal parameters had altered definitions. Results: Twenty-eight parameters (20 periportal and 8 perisinusoidal) were significantly different between the F1 and F2 cases that prompted a change of stage after a careful consensus read. The discriminatory ability of these parameters was further demonstrated in a comparison between the true F1 and true F2 cases as 26 out of the 28 parameters showed significant differences. These 26 parameters constitute a novel sub-algorithm that could accurately stratify F1 and F2 cases. Conclusion: The refined qFibrosis algorithm incorporated 26 novel parameters that showed a good discriminatory ability for NASH fibrosis stage 1 and 2 cases, representing an invaluable assistive tool for in-house pathologists when screening patients for NASH clinical trials.",

AlphaFold has appended projects and research directions. The database it has been creating promises an untold number of applications with vast potential impacts that are still difficult to surmise. AI approaches can revolutionize personalized treatments and usher in better-informed clinical trials. They promise to make giant leaps toward reshaping and revamping drug discovery strategies, selecting and prioritizing combinations of drug targets. Here, we briefly overview AI in structural biology, including in molecular dynamics simulations and prediction of microbiota\u2013human protein\u2013protein interactions. We highlight the advancements accomplished by the deep-learning-powered AlphaFold in protein structure prediction and their powerful impact on the life sciences. At the same time, AlphaFold does not resolve the decades-long protein folding challenge, nor does it identify the folding pathways. The models that AlphaFold provides do not capture conformational mechanisms like frustration and allostery, which are rooted in ensembles, and controlled by their dynamic distributions. Allostery and signaling are properties of populations. AlphaFold also does not generate ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins and regions, instead describing them by their low structural probabilities. Since AlphaFold generates single ranked structures, rather than conformational ensembles, it cannot elucidate the mechanisms of allosteric activating driver hotspot mutations nor of allosteric drug resistance. However, by capturing key features, deep learning techniques can use the single predicted conformation as the basis for generating a diverse ensemble.",

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) centred diagnostic systems are increasingly recognised as robust solutions in healthcare delivery pathways. In turn, there has been a concurrent rise in secondary research studies regarding these technologies in order to influence key clinical and policymaking decisions. It is therefore essential that these studies accurately appraise methodological quality and risk of bias within shortlisted trials and reports. In order to assess whether this critical step is performed, we undertook a meta-research study evaluating adherence to the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool within AI diagnostic accuracy systematic reviews. A literature search was conducted on all studies published from 2000 to December 2020. Of 50 included reviews, 36 performed the quality assessment, of which 27 utilised the QUADAS-2 tool. Bias was reported across all four domains of QUADAS-2. Two hundred forty-three of 423 studies (57.5%) across all systematic reviews utilising QUADAS-2 reported a high or unclear risk of bias in the patient selection domain, 110 (26%) reported a high or unclear risk of bias in the index test domain, 121 (28.6%) in the reference standard domain and 157 (37.1%) in the flow and timing domain. This study demonstrates the incomplete uptake of quality assessment tools in reviews of AI-based diagnostic accuracy studies and highlights inconsistent reporting across all domains of quality assessment. Poor standards of reporting act as barriers to clinical implementation. The creation of an AI-specific extension for quality assessment tools of diagnostic accuracy AI studies may facilitate the safe translation of AI tools into clinical practice.",

Artificial Intelligence (AI) via Machine Learning (ML) may represent an effective tool to predict clinical development of investigational agents. Areal covered Experimental drugs in Phase I and II development for COPD from early 2014 to late 2022 were identified in the ClinicalTrials.gov database. Different ML models, trained from prior knowledge on clinical trial success, were used to predict the probability that experimental drugs will successfully advance toward approval in COPD, according to Bayesian inference as follows: \u226425% low probability, >25% and\u2009\u226450% moderate probability, >50% and\u2009\u226475% high probability, and\u2009>75% very high probability. Expert opinion The Artificial Neural Network and Random Forest ML models indicated that, among the current experimental drugs in clinical trials for COPD, only the bifunctional muscarinic antagonist - \u03b22-adrenoceptor agonists (MABA) navafenterol and batefenterol, the inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/MABA fluticasone furoate/batefenterol, and the bifunctional phosphodiesterase (PDE) 3/4 inhibitor ensifentrine resulted to have a moderate to very high probability of being approved in the next future, however not before 2025.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objective The objective of our research is to conduct a comprehensive review that aims to systematically map, describe, and summarize the current utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) in the recruitment and retention of participants in clinical trials. Materials and Methods A comprehensive electronic search was conducted using the search strategy developed by the authors. The search encompassed research published in English, without any time limitations, which utilizes AI in the recruitment process of clinical trials. Data extraction was performed using a data charting table, which included publication details, study design, and specific outcomes/results. Results The search yielded 5731 articles, of which 51 were included. All the studies were designed specifically for optimizing recruitment in clinical trials and were published between 2004 and 2023. Oncology was the most covered clinical area. Applying AI to recruitment in clinical trials has demonstrated several positive outcomes, such as increasing efficiency, cost savings, improving recruitment, accuracy, patient satisfaction, and creating user-friendly interfaces. It also raises various technical and ethical issues, such as limited quantity and quality of sample size, privacy, data security, transparency, discrimination, and selection bias. Discussion and Conclusion While AI holds promise for optimizing recruitment in clinical trials, its effectiveness requires further validation. Future research should focus on using valid and standardized outcome measures, methodologically improving the rigor of the research carried out.",

      "title": "A novel method for causal structure discovery from EHR data and its application to type-2 diabetes mellitus",
      "abstract": "Modern AI-based clinical decision support models owe their success in part to the very large number of predictors they use. Safe and robust decision support, especially for intervention planning, requires causal, not associative, relationships. Traditional methods of causal discovery, clinical trials and extracting biochemical pathways, are resource intensive and may not scale up to the number and complexity of relationships sufficient for precision treatment planning. Computational causal structure discovery (CSD) from electronic health records (EHR) data can represent a solution, however, current CSD methods fall short on EHR data. This paper presents a CSD method tailored to the EHR data. The application of the proposed methodology was demonstrated on type-2 diabetes mellitus. A large EHR dataset from Mayo Clinic was used as development cohort, and another large dataset from an independent health system, M Health Fairview, as external validation cohort. The proposed method achieved very high recall (.95) and substantially higher precision than the general-purpose methods (.84 versus .29, and .55). The causal relationships extracted from the development and external validation cohorts had a high (81%) overlap. Due to the adaptations to EHR data, the proposed method is more suitable for use in clinical decision support than the general-purpose methods.",

      "abstract": "Clinical trials in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH, formerly known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) require histologic scoring for assessment of inclusion criteria and endpoints. However, variability in interpretation has impacted clinical trial outcomes. We developed an artificial intelligence-based measurement (AIM) tool for scoring MASH histology (AIM-MASH). AIM-MASH predictions for MASH Clinical Research Network necroinflammation grades and fibrosis stages were reproducible (\u03ba\u2009=\u20091) and aligned with expert pathologist consensus scores (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.62\u20130.74). The AIM-MASH versus consensus agreements were comparable to average pathologists for MASH Clinical Research Network scores (82% versus 81%) and fibrosis (97% versus 96%). Continuous scores produced by AIM-MASH for key histological features of MASH correlated with mean pathologist scores and noninvasive biomarkers and strongly predicted progression-free survival in patients with stage 3 (P\u2009<\u20090.0001) and stage 4 (P\u2009=\u20090.03) fibrosis. In a retrospective analysis of the ATLAS trial (NCT03449446), responders receiving study treatment showed a greater continuous change in fibrosis compared with placebo (P\u2009=\u20090.02). Overall, these results suggest that AIM-MASH may assist pathologists in histologic review of MASH clinical trials, reducing inter-rater variability on trial outcomes and offering a more sensitive and reproducible measure of patient responses.",

      "abstract": "Background Patient\u2013ventilator asynchrony (PVA) is a common problem in patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) in the intensive care unit (ICU), and may accelerate lung injury and diaphragm mis-contraction. The impact of PVA on clinical outcomes has not been systematically evaluated. Effective interventions (except for closed-loop ventilation) for reducing PVA are not well established. Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the impact of PVA on clinical outcomes in patients undergoing MV (Part A) and the effectiveness of interventions for patients undergoing MV except for closed-loop ventilation (Part B). We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO-ICTRP until August 2020. In Part A, we defined asynchrony index (AI)\u2009\u2265\u200910 or ineffective triggering index (ITI)\u2009\u2265\u200910 as high PVA. We compared patients having high PVA with those having low PVA. Results Eight studies in Part A and eight trials in Part B fulfilled the eligibility criteria. In Part A, five studies were related to the AI and three studies were related to the ITI. High PVA may be associated with longer duration of mechanical ventilation (mean difference, 5.16 days; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.38 to 7.94; n \u2009=\u20098; certainty of evidence [CoE], low), higher ICU mortality (odds ratio [OR], 2.73; 95% CI 1.76 to 4.24; n \u2009=\u20096; CoE, low), and higher hospital mortality (OR, 1.94; 95% CI 1.14 to 3.30; n \u2009=\u20095; CoE, low). In Part B, interventions involving MV mode, tidal volume, and pressure-support level were associated with reduced PVA. Sedation protocol, sedation depth, and sedation with dexmedetomidine rather than propofol were also associated with reduced PVA. Conclusions PVA may be associated with longer MV duration, higher ICU mortality, and higher hospital mortality. Physicians may consider monitoring PVA and adjusting ventilator settings and sedatives to reduce PVA. Further studies with adjustment for confounding factors are warranted to determine the impact of PVA on clinical outcomes.

      "abstract": "Background Clinical trials are essential for bringing new drugs, technologies and procedures to the market and clinical practice. Considering the design and the four-phase development, only 10% of them complete the entire process, partly due to the increasing costs and complexity of clinical trials. This low completion rate has a huge negative impact in terms of population health, quality of care and health economics and sustainability. Automating some of the process' tasks with artificial intelligence (AI) tools could optimize some of the most burdensome ones, like patient selection, matching and enrollment; better patient selection could also reduce harmful treatment side effects. Although the pharmaceutical industry is embracing artificial AI tools, there is little evidence in the literature of their application in clinical trials. Methods To address this issue, we performed a scoping review. Following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we performed a search on PubMed for articles on the implementation of AI in the development of clinical trials. Results The search yielded 772 articles, of which 15 were included. The articles were published between 2019 and 2022 and the results were presented descriptively. About half of the studies addressed the topic of patient recruitment; 12 articles reported specific examples of AI applications; five studies presented a quantitative estimate of the effectiveness of these tools. Conclusion All studies present encouraging results on the implementation of AI-based applications to the development of clinical trials. AI-based applications have a lot of potential, but more studies are needed to validate these tools and facilitate their adoption.",

      "abstract": "This study critically examines the ethical standards governing clinical trials, focusing on regulatory compliance, informed consent, and the protection of participant rights. The purpose is to assess the current ethical frameworks and explore emerging trends that shape the evolving landscape of clinical research. Through a detailed review of existing literature, this paper analyzes how global regulatory bodies and ethical guidelines, such as Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the Declaration of Helsinki, guide the ethical conduct of trials while identifying gaps that have emerged due to advances in technology and the globalization of clinical research. Key findings reveal that while informed consent remains central to participant autonomy, challenges persist in ensuring true comprehension across diverse populations, particularly in the context of complex interventions and digital tools. The growing use of artificial intelligence (AI), decentralized trial designs, and precision medicine introduces both opportunities and ethical dilemmas, especially regarding data privacy, participant selection, and regulatory harmonization in multinational trials. Conclusions emphasize the need for adaptive ethical frameworks that address the unique risks and benefits associated with these emerging trends. Recommendations include strengthening global regulatory harmonization, enhancing transparency in AI-driven research, and ensuring that participant rights, particularly data security and informed consent, are prioritized in evolving clinical trial designs. These steps are crucial for maintaining public trust and advancing medical research ethically and responsibly.",

      "abstract": "The integration of predictive analytics in clinical trials represents a transformative advancement in personalized medicine, reshaping traditional paradigms of drug development and patient care. This study explores the pivotal role predictive analytics plays in optimizing clinical trials by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning models to process vast datasets, including genetic information, patient demographics, and biomarkers. The purpose of this research is to analyze how predictive models enhance patient selection, streamline trial designs, and ultimately improve clinical outcomes. A comprehensive review of current methodologies reveals that predictive analytics offers significant advantages in enhancing precision and reducing trial timelines through adaptive designs. By predicting patient responses and adverse events, these models not only improve the efficiency of clinical trials but also mitigate risks, ensuring higher safety and efficacy. Despite these benefits, the study identifies challenges such as data bias, privacy concerns, and the need for robust regulatory frameworks, which remain critical hurdles to widespread adoption. Key findings highlight the importance of addressing these ethical and operational challenges to fully realize the potential of predictive analytics. The study concludes with recommendations for ongoing research into explainable AI, federated learning, and real-time analytics to expand the applicability of predictive models. As healthcare moves towards increasingly data-driven approaches, predictive analytics is set to play a central role in delivering personalized, equitable, and effective care, driving forward the future of clinical trials and personalized medicine.",

      "abstract": "Patients diagnosed with exudative neovascular age-related macular degeneration are commonly treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents. However, response to treatment is heterogeneous, without a clinical explanation. Predicting suboptimal response at baseline will enable more efficient clinical trial designs for novel, future interventions and facilitate individualised therapies. In this multicentre study, we trained a multi-modal artificial intelligence (AI) system to identify suboptimal responders to the loading-phase of the anti-VEGF agent aflibercept from baseline characteristics. We collected clinical features and optical coherence tomography scans from 1720 eyes of 1612 patients between 2019 and 2021. We evaluated our AI system as a patient selection method by emulating hypothetical clinical trials of different sizes based on our test set. Our method detected up to 57.6% more suboptimal responders than random selection, and up to 24.2% more than any alternative selection criteria tested. Applying this method to the entry process of candidates into randomised controlled trials may contribute to the success of such trials and further inform personalised care.",

      "abstract": "Multiple three-dimensional (3D) tumour organoid models assisted by multi-omics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have contributed greatly to preclinical drug development and precision medicine. The intrinsic ability to maintain genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of tumours allows for the reconciliation of shortcomings in traditional cancer models. While their utility in preclinical studies have been well established, little progress has been made in translational research and clinical trials. In this review, we identify the major bottlenecks preventing patient-derived tumour organoids (PDTOs) from being used in clinical setting. Unsuitable methods of tissue acquisition, disparities in establishment rates and a lengthy timeline are the limiting factors for use of PDTOs in clinical application. Potential strategies to overcome this include liquid biopsies via circulating tumour cells (CTCs), an automated organoid platform and optical metabolic imaging (OMI). These proposed solutions accelerate and optimize the workflow of a clinical organoid drug screening. As such, PDTOs have the potential for potential applications in clinical oncology to improve patient outcomes. If remarkable progress is made, cancer patients can finally benefit from this revolutionary technology.",

The goal of primary prevention strategies is to lower the risk of developing CAD. Nevertheless, current methods usually rely on simple risk assessment instruments that might overlook significant individual risk factors. This limitation highlights the need for innovative methods that can accurately assess cardiovascular risk and offer personalized preventive care. Recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have opened up interesting new avenues for optimizing primary preventive efforts for CAD and improving risk prediction models. By leveraging large-scale databases and advanced computational techniques, AI has the potential to fundamentally alter how cardiovascular risk is evaluated and managed. This review looks at current randomized controlled studies and clinical trials that explore the application of AI and machine learning to improve primary preventive measures for CAD. The emphasis is on their ability to recognize and include a range of risk elements in sophisticated risk assessment models.",

      "title": "How Artificial Intelligence Can Transform Randomized Controlled Trials",
      "abstract": "With the advent of deep learning (DL), the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data in healthcare has started transforming the way we approach medicine including clinical trials.1,2 The randomized controlled trial (RCT) has been traditionally accepted as the most robust method of assessing the risks and benefits of any intervention.3 However, the undertaking of an RCT is not always feasible due to the rarity of the disease, or time and costs that would impinge on the healthcare system. AI is an academic discipline founded in 1956.4 Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of AI that can learn complex relationships or patterns from data and make accurate decisions.5 DL or deep artificial networks are a relatively new subfield of ML that takes advantage of powerful computational processing capacity provided by Graphic Processing Units and exponentially increasing datasets from medical records, images, multi-omics, and other \u201cBig Data\u201d.6 By feeding an enormous amount of data in training, a DL algorithm allows the model to alter its internal parameters between each neuronal layer to increase its performance. Applications of AI, DL in particular, have been successful in ophthalmic imaging research,7\u201310 and the application of AI in RCTs may become reality in the near future. Common pitfalls of unsuccessful RCTs include poor patient selection, inadequate randomization with residual confounders, insufficient sample size, and poor selection of end points.11 With well-curated large datasets that incorporate clinical and multimodal imaging, AI models can be trained to select the potential study participants without relying on costly manual review to predict the natural history of each study participants with advanced statistical methods, and to assess study end points in a data-driven method. Given these advantages, the application of AI has potentials for more efficient execution and greater statistical power than what would be expected from traditional RCTs. First, ML models can drastically improve the patient selection process, thus lowering the burden of individual screening and need for large sample sizes. Recruiting the patients who meet precise selection criteria is crucial to avoid potential confounders or misclassifications. ML can combine multimodal data, such as imaging, laboratory, and other complex -omics data, to screen and select patients who match complex inclusion criteria, which can improve the recruitment efficiency. This is one of the areas in which the American Academy of Ophthalmology\u2019s Intelligent Research in Sight (IRIS) data will be utilized for RCT recruitment (personal communication, Flora Lum, MD). In addition to the efficient selection process, having a sufficient sample size to enable detection of statistically significant differences between groups is critical. Many RCTs require a large sample size because the effect of the treatment in question is small.12 AI has the potential in selecting \u201cthe ideal\u201dpatients for RCTs, who are \u201cfast progressors\u201d of the disease based on the AI\u2019s predictive algorithm. Thus, the expected effect size will be large and required sample size will be small resulting in a much shorter duration of RCTs. Selecting the \u201cfast progressors\u201d alone will limit the generalizability of the trial results; however, it may expedite the development of novel therapies, in particular for rare diseases. Second, AI-generated end points have the potential to minimize measurement errors and analyze the data without human-imposed biases. Furthermore, algorithms may enable more sensitive quantification of key study end points than how they are traditionally measured. For example, central macular",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction The concept of Digital Twins (DTs) translated to drug development and clinical trials describes virtual representations of systems of various complexities, ranging from individual cells to entire humans, and enables in silico simulations and experiments. DTs increase the efficiency of drug discovery and development by digitalizing processes associated with high economic, ethical, or social burden. The impact is multifaceted: DT models sharpen disease understanding, support biomarker discovery and accelerate drug development, thus advancing precision medicine. One way to realize DTs is by generative artificial intelligence (AI), a cutting-edge technology that enables the creation of novel, realistic and complex data with desired properties. Areas covered The authors provide a brief introduction to generative AI and describe how it facilitates the modeling of DTs. In addition, they compare existing implementations of generative AI for DTs in drug discovery and clinical trials. Finally, they discuss technical and regulatory challenges that should be addressed before DTs can transform drug discovery and clinical trials. Expert opinion The current state of DTs in drug discovery and clinical trials does not exploit the entire power of generative AI yet and is limited to simulation of a small number of characteristics. Nonetheless, generative AI has the potential to transform the field by leveraging recent developments in deep learning and customizing models for the needs of scientists, physicians and patients.",

Hence, the view that the clinical benefit of AI systems needs to be studied in clinical trials\u2014particularly randomised controlled trials (RCTs)\u2014is gaining ground. However, an issue that has been overlooked so far in the debate is that, compared with drug RCTs, AI RCTs require methodological adjustments, which entail ethical challenges.

Developing new drug molecules to overcome any disease is a costly and lengthy process, but the process continues uninterrupted. The critical point to consider the drug design is to use the available data resources and to find new and novel leads. Once the drug target is identified, several interdisciplinary areas work together with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods to get enriched drugs. These AI and ML methods are applied in every step of the computer-aided drug design, and integrating these AI and ML methods results in a high success rate of hit compounds. In addition, this AI and ML integration with high-dimension data and its powerful capacity have taken a step forward. Clinical trials output prediction through the AI/ML integrated models could further decrease the clinical trials cost by also improving the success rate. Through this review, we discuss the backend of AI and ML methods in supporting the computer-aided drug design, along with its challenge and opportunity for the pharmaceutical industry.

Methods We searched for peer-reviewed protocols and completed AI-RCTs evaluating the clinical effectiveness of AI tools and identified development and validation studies of AI tools. We collected detailed information, and evaluated patterns of development and external validation of AI tools. Results We found 23 AI-RCTs evaluating the clinical impact of 18 unique AI tools (2009\u20132021). Standard-of-care interventions were used in the control arms in all but one AI-RCT. Investigators did not provide access to the software code of the AI tool in any of the studies. Considering the primary outcome, the results were in favour of the AI intervention in 82% of the completed AI-RCTs (14 out of 17). We identified significant variation in the patterns of development, external validation and clinical evaluation approaches among different AI tools. A published development study was found only for 10 of the 18 AI tools. Median time from the publication of a development study to the respective AI-RCT was 1.4 years (IQR 0.2\u20132.2). Conclusions We found significant variation in the patterns of development and validation for AI tools before their evaluation in dedicated AI-RCTs. Published peer-reviewed protocols and completed AI-RCTs were also heterogeneous in design and reporting. Upcoming guidelines providing guidance for the development and clinical translation process aim to improve these aspects.",

      "abstract": "Opinion statementIn the past decade, several endocrine treatment regimens have been developed for the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer, including tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors (AI), or a combination of these. The standard duration of adjuvant endocrine treatment has been 5\u00a0years for a long time. Nevertheless, the high number of recurrences occurring after 5\u00a0years suggested that extended endocrine therapy could further improve outcome, which led to the start of several randomized clinical trials investigating the effects of extended use of endocrine therapy. The extended duration of tamoxifen has been shown to improve disease-free survival and overall survival in the ATLAS and aTTom trials. However, in postmenopausal women, AIs have been shown to be more effective when compared with tamoxifen. Based hereon, it is recommended that adjuvant endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer should include an AI. Recently, the DATA, IDEAL, and NSABP B42 trials showed that extended adjuvant endocrine therapy with AIs beyond 5\u00a0years in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer did reduce the occurrence of secondary breast tumors, but had no or only a small impact on distant metastasis free survival. Furthermore, toxicity of adjuvant AIs led to gradually decreasing compliance rates and long-term toxicities to non-breast cancer-related deaths. Therefore, we suggest considering extended adjuvant treatment only in women with high-risk early breast cancer who tolerate treatment well.",

      "title": "Randomized Clinical Trials of Artificial Intelligence.",
      "abstract": "As patient data are increasingly captured digitally, the opportunities to deploy artificial intelligence (AI), especially machine learning, are increasing rapidly. Machine learning is automated learning by computers using tools such as artificial neural networks to search data iteratively for optimal solutions.1 Typical applications include searching for novel patterns (eg, latent cancer subtypes2), making a diagnosis or outcome prediction (eg, diabetic retinopathy3), and optimizing treatment decisions (eg, fluid and vasopressor titration for septic shock4). Although many express excitement regarding the promise of AI, others express concern about adverse consequences, such as loss of physician and patient autonomy or unintended bias, and still others claim that the entire endeavor is largely hype, with virtually no data that actual patient outcomes have improved.5,6 One issue complicating this debate is that the classic measure of clinical benefit, the randomized clinical trial (RCT), is rare in this field, if not entirely absent. For example, the US Food and Drug Administration recently approved AI-enabled decision support tools (also called software as medical devices or SaMDs) for diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy on digital fundoscopy and early warning of stroke on computed tomography scans.7,8 In neither instance was approval based on any RCT evidence that the information provided by the SaMD improved care. Of course, diagnostic tools entered clinical practice for decades without the requirement for RCT data. However, these tools were traditionally framed as providing data, leaving judgment to physicians. In contrast, AI can provide data and judgment, thus altering clinician actions much more substantially.9 Against this backdrop, in this issue of JAMA, the report by Wijnberge et al10 of a clinical trial of an AI-derived clinical decision support tool provides important insight into the way RCTs might inform the debate on AI in health care. The study, somewhat ironically entitled the Hypotension Prediction During Surgery (HYPE) trial, randomized 68 patients who were undergoing elective noncardiac surgery to intraoperative management guided by an AI-based early warning system (intervention group) or standard care (control group). The primary objective was to test whether the intervention reduced the depth and duration of intraoperative hypotension (calculated as a time-weighted average). Both groups were managed with continuous radial artery pressure monitoring. In the intervention group, the arterial pressure was monitored by a SaMD that used 23 waveform variables, extracted continuously, to provide an updated prediction every 20 seconds of the likelihood of intraoperative hypotension (defined as mean arterial pressure <65 mm Hg) in the subsequent 15 minutes. The device issued an alarm when the risk exceeded 85% and encouraged the anesthesiologist to take preemptive action. The device displayed the risk score and a read-out of key variables (eg, stroke volume) used by the algorithm. The investigators also educated the anesthesiologists about the features of the device and provided a protocol to aid interpretation together with training on suggested actions to take (eg, intravenous fluid bolus or infusion of vasoactive agent) when the algorithm generated an alarm. In the control group, arterial wave data still flowed to the AI algorithm to allow it to run in silent mode, but only routine pulse and blood pressure data were displayed, as per standard care. The trial demonstrated that the intervention successfully reduced patients\u2019 exposure to hypotension, as evidenced by the primary outcome of a lower time-weighted average of intraoperative hypotension (0.1 vs 0.44 mm Hg; median difference, 0.38 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.14-0.43 mm Hg; P < .001), fewer episodes of hypotension per patient (3 vs 8 episodes per patient; median difference, 4 episodes; 95% CI, 1-7 episodes; P = 004), and fewer mean minutes with hypotension (8.0 vs 32.7 minutes; median difference, 16.7 minutes; 95% CI, 7.7-31 minutes; P < .001). Intraoperative management was also different between groups. The AI algorithm provided warnings frequently, including 377 alarms lasting longer than 1 minute (12 alarms per patient), and prompted anesthesiologists to initiate treatment within 2 minutes on 304 occasions (81%). Across several prespecified and post hoc analyses, anesthesiologists\u2019 behaviors differed between groups. Broadly speaking, anesthesiologists in the intervention group acted more often, acted sooner, and selected different treatments. There are several notable features about this trial. First, the problem the authors addressed is ideal for machine learning. Millions of patients require anesthesia every year, during which hypotension is both common and associated with adverse sequelae.11,12 High-fidelity continuous blood pressure monitoring is routinely collected but potentially underused because of the limits of human cognition. The algorithm, generated and published previously, was built from an automated search across arterial waveform data from more than 1000 patients, exploring the potential contribution of more than 3000 waveform features in more than 2.6 million feature combinations.13 The final model predicts the likelihood of future hypotension via measurement of multiple variables characterizing dynamic interactions between left ventricular contractility, preload, and afterload.

      "abstract": "Despite advances in artificial intelligence (AI), its application in medical imaging has been burdened and limited by expert-generated labels. We used images from optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), a relatively new imaging modality that measures retinal blood flow, to train an AI algorithm to generate flow maps from standard optical coherence tomography (OCT) images, exceeding the ability and bypassing the need for expert labeling. Deep learning was able to infer flow from single structural OCT images with similar fidelity to OCTA and significantly better than expert clinicians (P\u2009<\u20090.00001). Our model allows generating flow maps from large volumes of previously collected OCT data in existing clinical trials and clinical practice. This finding demonstrates a novel application of AI to medical imaging, whereby subtle regularities between different modalities are used to image the same body part and AI is used to generate detailed inferences of tissue function from structure imaging.",

      "abstract": "Substantial healthcare barriers, especially to specialty and cancer care, exist for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) individuals and communities at all levels. The unique history of AI/AN Tribal Nations and resulting policies, treaties, and relationships with the US government and federal agencies have created specific barriers to healthcare and clinical trial access for AI/AN peoples. Commonly, AI/AN peoples harbor a long-standing mistrust of the healthcare system based on lived and historical experiences. The intersection of various barriers to care for AI/AN communities results in health inequities, lack of representation in clinical research, and other disparities faced by historically marginalized and underrepresented peoples. AI/AN patients face unique barriers in their healthcare journey due to a disproportionate burden of life-threatening and chronic diseases, including many cancers. Identifying barriers specific to AI/AN peoples and improving access to high-quality care, with a focus on building on the strengths and capacities in each AI/AN community are vital to improving health equity. In this review, we describe patient, provider, and institutional barriers to healthcare, particularly specialty care and clinical research, for AI/AN peoples, with a focus on the Northern Plains AI communities. Examples and best practices to improve AI/AN patient access to health services, including screening and specialty care, as well as to clinical research, are provided. We emphasize the importance of longitudinal community-based partnerships and strength- and trust-based approaches as essential components of promoting equitable access to high-quality specialty care and recruitment and participation of AI/AN individuals and communities in clinical research.",

      "abstract": "The recent pandemic ushered in a marked surge in the adoption of digital health technologies (DHTs), necessitating remote approaches aiming to safeguard both patient and healthcare provider well-being. These technologies encompass an array of terms, including e-health, m-health, telemedicine, wearables, sensors, smartphone apps, digital therapeutics, virtual and augmented reality, and artificial intelligence (AI). Notably, some DHTs employed in critical healthcare decisions may transition into the realm of medical devices, subjecting them to more stringent regulatory scrutiny. Consequently, it is imperative to understand the validation processes of these technologies within clinical studies. Our study summarizes an extensive examination of clinical trials focusing on cardiovascular (CV) diseases and digital health (DH) interventions, with particular attention to those incorporating elements of AI. A dataset comprising 107 eligible trials, registered on clinicaltrials.gov and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) databases until 19 June 2023, forms the basis of our investigation. We focused on clinical trials employing DHTs in the European context, revealing a diverse landscape of interventions. Devices constitute the predominant category (45.8%), followed by behavioral interventions (17.8%). Within the CV domain, trials predominantly span pivotal or confirmatory phases, with a notable presence of smaller feasibility and exploratory studies. Notably, a majority of trials exhibit randomized, parallel assignment designs. When analyzing the multifaceted landscape of trial outcomes, we identified various categories such as physiological and functional measures, diagnostic accuracy, CV events and mortality, patient outcomes, quality of life, treatment adherence and effectiveness, quality of hospital processes, and usability/feasibility measures. Furthermore, we delve into a subset of 15 studies employing AI and machine learning, describing various study design features, intended purposes and the validation strategies employed. In summary, we aimed to elucidate the diverse applications, study design features, and objectives of the evolving CV-related DHT clinical trials field.",

      "abstract": "Purpose: Success of clinical trials increasingly relies on effective selection of the target patient populations. We hypothesize that computational analysis of pre-accrual imaging data can be used for patient enrichment to better identify patients who can potentially benefit from investigational agents. Methods: This was tested retrospectively in soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) patients accrued into a randomized clinical trial (SARC021) that evaluated the efficacy of evofosfamide (Evo), a hypoxia activated prodrug, in combination with doxorubicin (Dox). Notably, SARC021 failed to meet its overall survival (OS) objective. We tested whether a radiomic biomarker-driven inclusion/exclusion criterion could have been used to improve the difference between the two arms (Evo + Dox vs. Dox) of the study. 164 radiomics features were extracted from 296 SARC021 patients with lung metastases, divided into training and test sets. Results: A single radiomics feature, Short Run Emphasis (SRE), was representative of a group of correlated features that were the most informative. The SRE feature value was combined into a model along with histological classification and smoking history. This model as able to identify an enriched subset (52%) of patients who had a significantly longer OS in Evo + Dox vs. Dox groups [p = 0.036, Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.64 (0.42\u20130.97)]. Applying the same model and threshold value in an independent test set confirmed the significant survival difference [p = 0.016, HR = 0.42 (0.20\u20130.85)]. Notably, this model was best at identifying exclusion criteria for patients most likely to benefit from doxorubicin alone. Conclusions: The study presents a first of its kind clinical-radiomic approach for patient enrichment in clinical trials. We show that, had an appropriate model been used for selective patient inclusion, SARC021 trial could have met its primary survival objective for patients with metastatic STS.",

      "abstract": "It is widely hoped that statistical models can improve decision-making related to medical treatments. Because of the cost and scarcity of medical outcomes data, this hope is typically based on investigators observing a model\u2019s success in one or two datasets or clinical contexts. We scrutinized this optimism by examining how well a machine learning model performed across several independent clinical trials of antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia. Models predicted patient outcomes with high accuracy within the trial in which the model was developed but performed no better than chance when applied out-of-sample. Pooling data across trials to predict outcomes in the trial left out did not improve predictions. These results suggest that models predicting treatment outcomes in schizophrenia are highly context-dependent and may have limited generalizability. Editor\u2019s summary A central promise of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is that large datasets can be mined to predict and identify the best course of care for future patients. Unfortunately, we do not know how these models would perform on new patients because they are rarely tested prospectively on truly independent patient samples. Chekroud et al. showed that machine learning models routinely achieve perfect performance in one dataset even when that dataset is a large international multisite clinical trial (see the Perspective by Petzschner). However, when that exact model was tested in truly independent clinical trials, performance fell to chance levels. Even when building what should be a more robust model by aggregating across a group of similar multisite trials, subsequent predictive performance remained poor. \u2014Peter Stern Clinical prediction models that work in one trial do not work in future trials of the same condition and same treatments.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Artificial intelligence shows promise for clinical research in inflammatory bowel disease endoscopy. Accurate assessment of endoscopic activity is important in clinical practice and inflammatory bowel disease clinical trials. Emerging artificial intelligence technologies can increase efficiency and accuracy of assessing the baseline endoscopic appearance in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and the impact that therapeutic interventions may have on mucosal healing in both of these contexts. In this review, state-of-the-art endoscopic assessment of mucosal disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease clinical trials is described, covering the potential for artificial intelligence to transform the current paradigm, its limitations, and suggested next steps. Site-based artificial intelligence quality evaluation and inclusion of patients in clinical trials without the need for a central reader is proposed; for following patient progress, a second reading using AI alongside a central reader with expedited reading is proposed. Artificial intelligence will support precision endoscopy in inflammatory bowel disease and is on the threshold of advancing inflammatory bowel disease clinical trial recruitment.",

      "abstract": "Drug repurposing, also known as drug repositioning or reprofiling, involves identifying new therapeutic uses for existing drugs beyond their original indications. Historical examples include sildenafil citrate transitioning to an erectile dysfunction treatment and thalidomide shifting from a sedative to an immunomodulatory agent. Advocates tout its potential to address unmet medical needs by expediting development, reducing costs, and using drugs with established safety profiles. However, concerns exist regarding specificity for new indications, safety, and regulatory exploitation. Ethical considerations include equitable access, informed consent when using drugs off-label, and transparency. Recent advancements include artificial intelligence (AI) applications, network pharmacology, and omics technologies. Clinical trials explore repurposed drugs\u2019 efficacy, with regulatory agencies facilitating approval. Challenges include intellectual property protection, drug target specificity, trial design complexities, and funding limitations. Ethical challenges encompass patient autonomy, potential conflicts of interest due to financial incentives for industries, and resource allocation. Future directions involve precision medicine, AI, and global collaboration. In conclusion, drug repurposing offers a promising pathway for therapeutic innovation but requires careful consideration of its complexities and ethical implications to maximize benefits and minimize risks.",

      "abstract": "Today's approach to medicine requires extensive trial and error to determine the proper treatment path for each patient. While many fields have benefited from technological breakthroughs in computer science, such as artificial intelligence (AI), the task of developing effective treatments is actually getting slower and more costly. With the increased availability of rich historical datasets from previous clinical trials and real\u2010world data sources, one can leverage AI models to create holistic forecasts of future health outcomes for an individual patient in the form of an AI\u2010generated digital twin. This could support the rapid evaluation of intervention strategies in silico and could eventually be implemented in clinical practice to make personalized medicine a reality. In this work, we focus on uses for AI\u2010generated digital twins of clinical trial participants and contend that the regulatory outlook for this technology within drug development makes it an ideal setting for the safe application of AI\u2010generated digital twins in healthcare. With continued research and growing regulatory acceptance, this path will serve to increase trust in this technology and provide momentum for the widespread adoption of AI\u2010generated digital twins in clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Background The number of artificial intelligence (AI) studies in medicine has exponentially increased recently. However, there is no clear quantification of the clinical benefits of implementing AI-assisted tools in patient care. Objective This study aims to systematically review all published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of AI-assisted tools to characterize their performance in clinical practice. Methods CINAHL, Cochrane Central, Embase, MEDLINE, and PubMed were searched to identify relevant RCTs published up to July 2021 and comparing the performance of AI-assisted tools with conventional clinical management without AI assistance. We evaluated the primary end points of each study to determine their clinical relevance. This systematic review was conducted following the updated PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 guidelines. Results Among the 11,839 articles retrieved, only 39 (0.33%) RCTs were included. These RCTs were conducted in an approximately equal distribution from North America, Europe, and Asia. AI-assisted tools were implemented in 13 different clinical specialties. Most RCTs were published in the field of gastroenterology, with 15 studies on AI-assisted endoscopy. Most RCTs studied biosignal-based AI-assisted tools, and a minority of RCTs studied AI-assisted tools drawn from clinical data. In 77% (30/39) of the RCTs, AI-assisted interventions outperformed usual clinical care, and clinically relevant outcomes improved with AI-assisted intervention in 70% (21/30) of the studies. Small sample size and single-center design limited the generalizability of these studies. Conclusions There is growing evidence supporting the implementation of AI-assisted tools in daily clinical practice; however, the number of available RCTs is limited and heterogeneous. More RCTs of AI-assisted tools integrated into clinical practice are needed to advance the role of AI in medicine.

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been the subject of considerable interest for many years for its potential to improve clinical care \u2014yet its actual impact on patient outcomes when deployed in clinical settings remains largely unknown. In a recent systematic review by Zhou et al., the authors surprisingly show that its impact so far has been quite limited. They reviewed 65 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating AI-based clinical interventions and found that there was no clinical benefit of using AI prediction tools compared to the standard of care in nearly 40% of studies. Among a subset of trials that the authors identified as having a low risk of bias, the clinical benefit of using deep learning (DL) predictive models over traditional statistical (TS) risk calculators was only minimal, and there was no benefit in using machine learning (ML) models over TS tools. Somewhat counterintuitively, most of the AI tools in these trials exhibited an excellent area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC; a common performance metric for predictive models) during development (median AUROC 0.81, IQR 0.75\u20130.90) and validation (median AUROC 0.83, IQR 0.79\u20130.97): a humbling reminder that robust predictive utility does not guarantee clinical impact at the bedside. As the science of building accurate predictive models progresses, our ability to translate these advancements into real-world clinical utility remains comparatively limited. How can we bridge this gap between AUROCs and clinical benefit?",

      "abstract": "Clinical Trials (CTs) remain the foundation of safe and effective drug development. Given the evolving data-driven and personalized medicine approach in healthcare, it is imperative for companies and regulators to utilize tailored Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions that enable expeditious and streamlined clinical research. In this paper, we identified opportunities, challenges, and potential implications of AI in CTs. Following an extensive search in relevant databases and websites, we gathered publications tackling the use of AI and Machine Learning (ML) in CTs from the past 5 years in the US and Europe, including Regulatory Authorities\u2019 documents. Documented applications of AI commonly concern the oncology field and are mostly being applied in the area of recruitment. Main opportunities discussed aim to create efficiencies across CT activities, including the ability to reduce sample sizes, improve enrollment and conduct faster, more optimized adaptive CTs. While AI is an area of enthusiastic development, the identified challenges are ethical in nature and relate to data availability, standards, and most importantly, lack of regulatory guidance hindering the acceptance of AI tools in drug development. However, future implications are significant and are anticipated to improve the probability of success, reduce trial burden and overall, speed up research and regulatory approval. The use of AI in CTs is in its relative infancy; however, it is a fast-evolving field. As regulators provide more guidance on the acceptability of AI in specific areas, we anticipate the scope of use to broaden and the volume of implementation to increase rapidly.",
