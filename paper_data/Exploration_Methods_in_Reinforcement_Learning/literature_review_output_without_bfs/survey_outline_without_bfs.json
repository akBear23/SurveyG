This highlights why effective exploration is crucial, particularly in scenarios characterized by sparse rewards, large state-action spaces, or complex dynamics where random actions are insufficient. Inadequate exploration can lead to suboptimal policies, local optima, and an inability to generalize. The core challenge lies in efficiently gathering diverse and informative experiences to build an accurate understanding of the environment's dynamics and reward structure, essential for robust decision-making and achieving high performance.",

This learned model is then used to generate simulated experiences, allowing the agent to perform 'mental rehearsals' and update its value functions without additional real-world interactions. While not directly designed as an exploration strategy, this process accelerates learning and propagates value information more efficiently throughout the state space, indirectly encouraging the agent to explore states relevant for model improvement and policy refinement. A key limitation was the reliance on accurate model learning, which is challenging in complex environments.",

This approach effectively decouples the intrinsic reward from environmental stochasticity, making it highly robust to unpredictable but uninteresting phenomena.
