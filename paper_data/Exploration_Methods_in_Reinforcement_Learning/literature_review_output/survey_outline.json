This subsection introduces frameworks like Two-Stage Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (TERL), which maintains and optimizes a population of complete RL agents (actor-critic pairs) through a hybrid of gradient-based RL and meta-optimization techniques like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). These approaches facilitate broader and more robust exploration by allowing diverse learning trajectories and efficient information sharing, representing a meta-level solution to the exploration-exploitation dilemma by structuring the learning system itself for enhanced discovery. This paradigm offers a powerful alternative for global search in complex reward landscapes.",

This subsection discusses how traditional active exploration is impossible, shifting the focus to 'conservative exploration' within the dataset's distribution. It covers methods that use uncertainty estimation (e.g., ensemble models) to identify reliable regions for policy improvement and avoid out-of-distribution actions, ensuring that learning remains robust and effective without generating new, potentially unsafe, experiences. This paradigm is crucial for real-world applications where data collection is costly or risky.",
