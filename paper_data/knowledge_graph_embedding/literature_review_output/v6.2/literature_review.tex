\section{Enhancing KGE Expressiveness: Context, Types, and Advanced Architectures}
\label{sec:enhancing\_kge\_expressiveness:\_context,\_types,\_\_and\_\_advanced\_architectures}

\subsection{Context-Augmented and Multi-view Embeddings}
\label{sec:3\_1\_context-augmented\_\_and\_\_multi-view\_embeddings}

Traditional Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models primarily derive representations from the intrinsic (head, relation, tail) triple structure, often struggling with data sparsity and the nuanced semantics of real-world knowledge graphs. To overcome these limitations, a significant line of research has focused on enriching entity and relation embeddings by integrating auxiliary information, such as textual descriptions, entity attributes, logical rules, or multi-modal data. These "multi-view" embeddings combine diverse feature types, often through specialized neural networks or attention mechanisms, to create more robust and semantically rich representations.

Early efforts to augment KGE models incorporated supplementary textual information. \cite{xiao2016} introduced Semantic Space Projection (SSP), which leverages textual descriptions by projecting the triple loss vector onto a dynamically generated semantic hyperplane, thereby modeling strong correlations between symbolic facts and text. Similarly, \cite{guo2015} proposed Semantically Smooth Embedding (SSE), which enforces a "semantically smooth" embedding space by constraining entities belonging to the same semantic category to be close in the vector space, utilizing manifold learning algorithms like Laplacian Eigenmaps. Building on the utility of entity types, \cite{wang2021} developed TransET, a model that employs circle convolution based on both entity and type embeddings to generate type-specific representations, enhancing the capture of semantic features. More recently, \cite{he2023} presented TaKE, a model-agnostic framework that automatically learns implicit type features through a relation-specific hyperplane mechanism, addressing the common issue of missing explicit type supervision in real-world KGs.

Beyond static attributes and descriptions, logical rules offer a powerful form of auxiliary information. \cite{guo2017} introduced RUGE, a novel paradigm that iteratively guides KGE learning with soft logical rules, demonstrating that even uncertain, automatically extracted rules can significantly enhance link prediction. To improve the scalability of rule integration, \cite{guo2020} proposed Soft Logical Rule Embedding (SLRE), which regularizes relation representations directly, making the complexity of rule learning independent of the entity set size. Further advancing rule-guided reasoning, \cite{tang2022} developed RulE, a framework that learns explicit rule embeddings and jointly represents entities, relations, and logical rules in a unified space, enabling soft rule inference and mutual regularization between KGE and rule-based components.

Other approaches have focused on leveraging deeper structural context or hyper-relational information. \cite{zhang2018} proposed a method to incorporate a three-layer Hierarchical Relation Structure (HRS) into existing KGE models, enriching embeddings by categorizing relations into clusters, individual relations, and fine-grained sub-relations. Moving beyond simple triplets, \cite{rosso2020} introduced HINGE, a hyper-relational KGE model that directly learns from facts augmented with key-value pairs, capturing both the primary triplet structure and the correlations with associated attributes, which was previously oversimplified.

The integration of multiple, heterogeneous data sources, often termed "multi-view" or "multi-modal" embeddings, has led to more sophisticated models. \cite{shen2022} presented LASS, a method that jointly embeds language semantics from pre-trained language models (LMs) and structural information from knowledge graphs by fine-tuning LMs with a probabilistic structured loss, demonstrating superior performance in low-resource settings. For entity alignment, \cite{zhang2019} developed MultiKE, a framework that unifies multiple entity views (name, relation, attribute) through view-specific embeddings and novel cross-KG inference, including a soft alignment mechanism for relations and attributes. In the biomedical domain, \cite{zhu2022} proposed a multimodal reasoning approach for disease-specific knowledge graphs, integrating structural, categorical, and descriptive embeddings via a reverse-hyperplane projection method to discover new knowledge. Similarly, \cite{yang2025} introduced SEConv for healthcare prediction, combining a resource-efficient self-attention mechanism with a multilayer convolutional neural network to learn deeper structural features from medical KGs.

Advanced neural architectures, particularly attention mechanisms and Transformers, have played a crucial role in effectively combining these diverse feature types. \cite{wang2020} proposed Graph Attenuated Attention networks (GAATs), which use an attenuated attention mechanism to assign different weights to relation paths and acquire information from neighboring nodes, leading to more robust entity and relation representations. For explainable recommendation, \cite{yang2023} developed CKGE, which uses a KG-based Transformer with relational attention and structural encoding to process motivation-aware meta-graphs, integrating contextualized neighbor semantics and high-order connections. \cite{shi2025} introduced TGformer, a graph transformer framework that constructs context-level subgraphs and employs a Knowledge Graph Transformer Network (KGTN) to explore multi-structural (triplet-level and graph-level) and contextual features. Furthermore, \cite{shang2024} presented MGTCA, which combines messages from mixed geometric spaces (hyperbolic, hypersphere, Euclidean) with a trainable convolutional attention network, allowing for adaptive switching between different Graph Neural Network (GNN) types to capture diverse local graph structures. In the realm of Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA), \cite{zhou2023} developed a system for chemistry that operates on hybrid multi-embedding spaces, leveraging BERT-based entity linking and a joint numerical embedding model to handle complex queries.

In conclusion, the evolution of KGE has progressively moved towards comprehensive representations that integrate auxiliary information beyond basic triples. These context-augmented and multi-view embedding approaches, ranging from explicit semantic projections and rule-guided learning to sophisticated multi-modal fusion and attention-based neural architectures, have significantly mitigated data sparsity and improved performance in tasks like link prediction, entity alignment, and recommendation. Future research directions include developing more dynamic and adaptive integration strategies for evolving multi-modal data, enhancing interpretability in complex multi-view models, and exploring novel methods for automatically discovering and leveraging latent auxiliary information from diverse data sources.
\subsection{Type-Aware and Hierarchical Embeddings}
\label{sec:3\_2\_type-aware\_\_and\_\_hierarchical\_embeddings}

Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models often gain significant expressive power and logical consistency by explicitly incorporating semantic type information or hierarchical structures inherent within knowledge graphs. These approaches move beyond simple triplet-level interactions to ensure that learned representations respect the inherent semantic categories and structural relationships between entities, thereby enhancing accuracy, particularly for KGs with rich ontological schemas.

Early efforts to infuse semantic information into KGE models include \cite{guo2015}, which proposed Semantically Smooth Embedding (SSE). SSE leverages external semantic categories (e.g., entity types) to enforce a "semantically smooth" embedding space, where entities of the same category are constrained to be close, improving embeddings by incorporating intrinsic geometric structure. Building on the idea of differentiated representations, \cite{lv2018} introduced TransC, which explicitly distinguishes between concepts and instances. TransC models concepts as spheres and instances as vectors, naturally capturing \texttt{isA} (instanceOf, subClassOf) transitivity by requiring instance vectors to lie within concept spheres, and sub-concept spheres within super-concept spheres. This geometric approach provides a more nuanced representation of hierarchical relationships than uniform vector embeddings.

Further extending the modeling of hierarchical structures, \cite{zhang2018} proposed a method that leverages a three-layer hierarchical relation structure (HRS) to learn knowledge representations. This HRS categorizes relations into clusters, individual relations, and fine-grained sub-relations, enriching the embedding process by integrating this structural information into existing KGE models like TransE and DistMult. Addressing the direct integration of entity types, \cite{wang2021} developed TransET, which employs circle convolution based on entity and type embeddings to generate type-specific representations for entities. This allows for more semantic features to be learned, moving beyond simple triple facts and better representing complex relations.

A more flexible approach to type integration was presented by \cite{he2023} with the Type-augmented Knowledge graph Embedding (TaKE) framework. TaKE is model-agnostic and learns implicit type features without requiring explicit type supervision, a common limitation in real-world KGs. It innovatively uses a relation-specific hyperplane mechanism to project an entity's type representation onto different hyperplanes, capturing the diverse type features relevant to each relation. In a similar vein, \cite{zhu2022} proposed a multimodal reasoning approach for disease-specific knowledge graphs that integrates category (type) embeddings via a novel reverse-hyperplane projection method. This demonstrates how type-aware projections can be specialized for domain-specific knowledge discovery, aligning with the principles of relation-specific type feature emphasis.

Beyond explicit type and hierarchical structures, logical rules often implicitly encode such semantic constraints. \cite{guo2017} introduced RUGE, a novel paradigm for KG embedding with iterative guidance from soft rules. RUGE enables an embedding model to learn simultaneously from labeled triples, unlabeled triples with predicted soft labels, and automatically extracted soft rules with varying confidence levels, allowing rules to iteratively refine embeddings and predictions. Expanding on rule integration, \cite{tang2022} proposed RulE, which learns explicit rule embeddings by jointly representing entities, relations, and first-order logical rules in a unified continuous space. RulE calculates rule confidence scores and uses a soft rule reasoning mechanism to address the brittleness of traditional logical inference, providing a balanced approach to reasoning. For scalable integration of soft rules, \cite{guo2020} developed Soft Logical Rule Embedding (SLRE), which directly regularizes relation representations to satisfy soft logical regularities, making the complexity of rule learning independent of the entity set size.

Finally, the inherent hierarchical nature of many KGs has led to the exploration of non-Euclidean geometries. \cite{pan2021} introduced a hyperbolic hierarchy-aware KGE model that leverages an extended Poincaré Ball and a polar coordinate system. This approach is designed to simultaneously capture both the complex hierarchical relationships and logical patterns within knowledge graphs, offering state-of-the-art results on specific link prediction tasks by exploiting the natural fit of hyperbolic space for hierarchical data.

Despite these advancements, challenges remain in seamlessly integrating diverse forms of type and hierarchical information. While models like TaKE and TransET effectively incorporate entity types, and TransC differentiates concepts, a universally adaptive framework that can dynamically infer and leverage optimal hierarchical structures (e.g., from flat KGs) for \textit{any} given entity and relation context is still an open area. Furthermore, balancing the expressiveness gained from complex type-aware and hierarchical models with computational efficiency, especially for extremely large and dynamic knowledge graphs, remains a critical unresolved issue. Future research could focus on more adaptive and automated methods for discovering and integrating latent hierarchical and type structures, potentially through meta-learning or self-supervised approaches, to further enhance the logical consistency and accuracy of KGE models.

    *   This confirms the GNN and Transformer focus.

*   \textbf{Development Directions Analysis:}
    *   The development direction specifically traces [yan2022] -> [li2023] -> [shi2025].
    \textit{   [li2023] Position-Aware Relational Transformer for Knowledge Graph Embedding (2023) is a crucial Transformer paper. It addresses the order-invariance problem in vanilla Transformers for KGs. }This paper is NOT in the provided "Papers to reference" list for the subsection, but it's central to the development direction for Transformers. I need to be careful here. The prompt says "Papers to reference (sorted chronologically)" and then provides summaries. If [li2023] is not in the list of papers to reference, I cannot cite it directly. The prompt also says "Each paper is described in 2-3 sentences with specific technical contributions, using citation in Available Citations." This means I can only use the provided citations.*
    \textit{   \textbf{Revised plan:} I need to focus on the papers }provided in the "Papers to reference" list\textit{. The development direction section is }general\textit{ and might include papers not explicitly provided for }this specific subsection\textit{. I will use the }themes\textit{ from the development direction (e.g., "specialized adaptation of Transformer architectures for relational semantics") but apply them to the }available* Transformer-related papers.

*   \textbf{Mapping Papers to Focus \& Connecting them:}

    *   \textbf{Opening:} Introduce the shift from simpler geometric models to advanced neural architectures (GNNs, Transformers) for capturing complex, non-linear features and multi-hop context in KGE. Mention the limitations of earlier models (e.g., geometric models like TransE, TransD, TransH, RotatE, CompoundE, HousE, SpherE, TorusE, TransMS, HolmE, FHRE, which are mostly from Subgroup 1 and some from Subgroup 3, but the prompt specifically asks to address "limitations of earlier geometric models").

    *   \textbf{GNNs for Multi-hop Context:}
        *   Start with GNNs' ability to aggregate neighborhood information.
        \textit{   \cite{wang2018} LAN: Early inductive KGE using logic attention for neighborhood aggregation, addressing permutation invariance and query awareness. }This is a good starting point for GNNs.*
        *   \cite{li2021} SE-GNN: Further explores how KGE extrapolates by identifying "Semantic Evidence" and proposes SE-GNN to explicitly model these factors through GNN mechanisms. This builds on the idea of structured aggregation for better generalization.
        \textit{   \cite{shang2024} MGTCA: Advances GNNs by addressing data dependence (GCN vs. GAT) and message limitations. It introduces a }Mixed Geometry Message Function\textit{ (hyperbolic, hypersphere, Euclidean) and a }Trainable Convolutional Attention Network* (TCAN) for adaptive GNN switching, showing how GNNs evolve to capture richer, multi-geometric structural information. This directly addresses the "message passing and aggregation mechanisms" part of the focus.
        *   \cite{modak2024} CPa-WAC: While primarily about scalability, its "Weighted Aggregation Composition (WAC) Convolution" is an improved compositional message-passing GCN. It also uses graph attention layers. I can frame this as a GNN approach that also considers scalability for large KGs.

    *   \textbf{CNNs for Feature Learning (as a bridge/related neural architecture):}
        *   \cite{zhang2020} M-DCN: Uses multi-scale dynamic convolutional networks to learn expressive features and handle complex relations, showing how CNNs contribute to learning non-linear features.
        *   \cite{xie2020} ReInceptionE: Combines CNNs (Inception network) for interaction learning with a relation-aware attention mechanism to incorporate local-global structural information. This bridges CNNs with attention and structural awareness.
        *   \cite{yang2025} SEConv: Applies self-attention and multi-layer CNNs for deeper structural features, specifically in healthcare. This shows the combination of attention and CNNs.

    *   \textbf{Transformers for Graph Structures:}
        *   The core idea of Transformers is self-attention.
        *   \cite{yang2023} CKGE: Introduces a KG-based Transformer with relational attention and structural encoding to model global dependencies for explainable recommendations. This shows adaptation of Transformers to KG structures.
        *   \cite{shi2025} TGformer: A direct application of a Graph Transformer framework for KGE. It constructs context-level subgraphs and uses a Knowledge Graph Transformer Network (KGTN) to explore multi-structural features (triplet-level and graph-level) across static and temporal KGs. This is a strong example of a Transformer adapted for KGE, capturing contextual and multi-structural information.

    *   \textbf{Connecting to "Limitations of earlier geometric models":}
        *   The neural models (GNNs, CNNs, Transformers) inherently move beyond the fixed, predefined scoring functions and geometric operations of models like TransE \cite{ji2015}, TransH \cite{wang2014}, TransMS \cite{yang2019}, TorusE \cite{ebisu2017}, CompoundE \cite{ge2022}, HousE \cite{li2022}, SpherE \cite{li2024}, FHRE \cite{liang2024}, and HolmE \cite{zheng2024}. These earlier models, while mathematically elegant, often struggled with complex, non-linear interactions, multi-hop reasoning, and inductive settings. The neural models learn these features directly from data, offering greater expressiveness and often inductive capabilities. For example, TransE and its variants are limited by their assumption of simple translational relationships, which struggle with 1-N, N-1, N-N relations and multi-hop reasoning. RotatE and its complex-space counterparts improve on this but still rely on fixed rotational operations. Hyperbolic models like FHRE and Pan et al.'s work are good for hierarchies but still operate within a geometric paradigm. The neural models offer a more flexible, data-driven approach to feature learning.

    *   \textbf{Closing:} Summarize the benefits (expressiveness, inductive capabilities, contextual understanding) and potential future directions (e.g., combining strengths, interpretability of complex models, scalability for very large KGs, dynamic KGs).

\textit{   \textbf{Self-correction on [li2023]:} Since [li2023] is not in the "Papers to reference" list, I cannot cite it. However, the }problem it solves\textit{ (order-invariance in Transformers for KGs) is a general challenge. I can discuss how Transformer-based models }address\textit{ such challenges, and then use [shi2025] and [yang2023] as examples of }how\textit{ Transformers are adapted to KGs. [shi2025] explicitly mentions "multi-structural features" and "context-level subgraph construction," which implies handling relational semantics beyond simple order-invariance. [yang2023] also talks about "relational attention and structural encoding" for global dependencies. This allows me to discuss the }concept* without citing the unavailable paper.

\subsection{Graph Neural Networks and Transformers for KGE}
The evolution of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) has seen a significant shift from models relying on predefined geometric transformations to advanced neural architectures capable of learning complex, non-linear features directly from the graph structure. This subsection focuses on the application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers, which move beyond the limitations of earlier geometric models by effectively capturing multi-hop structural context, neighborhood information, and global dependencies, leading to more expressive and often inductive embeddings.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) leverage message passing and aggregation mechanisms to capture the rich, multi-hop structural context inherent in knowledge graphs. These models allow entities to learn representations by iteratively aggregating information from their neighbors, thereby incorporating local and global graph structure. An early example of this paradigm is the Logic Attention Network (LAN) proposed by \cite{wang2018}, which pioneered inductive KGE by using a logic attention mechanism for neighborhood aggregation. This approach specifically addresses permutation invariance and query awareness, enabling the model to effectively embed emerging entities based on their local connections. Building on the understanding of how KGE models generalize, \cite{li2021} introduced Semantic Evidence (SE) and proposed SE-GNN, a GNN-based model that explicitly captures relation-level, entity-level, and triple-level semantic evidence through distinct neighbor aggregation patterns, leading to superior extrapolation abilities. For large-scale KGs, \cite{modak2024} developed CPa-WAC, a scalable GNN-based KGE model that incorporates a Weighted Aggregation Composition (WAC) convolution, an improved compositional message-passing GCN that uses graph attention layers to efficiently learn embeddings from partitioned subgraphs. Further advancing GNN capabilities, \cite{shang2024} introduced MGTCA, a model that addresses the data dependence of GNNs and the limitations of Euclidean-only message functions. MGTCA integrates a Mixed Geometry Message Function (combining hyperbolic, hypersphere, and Euclidean spaces) with a Trainable Convolutional Attention Network (TCAN) that adaptively switches between GNN types (GCN, GAT, and a novel KGCAT), allowing for richer, multi-geometric structural information capture and robust embedding learning.

Complementary to GNNs, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have also been adapted to learn intricate features from concatenated entity and relation embeddings. \cite{zhang2020} proposed the Multi-Scale Dynamic Convolutional Network (M-DCN), which employs multi-scale filters with dynamic, relation-specific weights to learn expressive features and effectively handle complex relation types (1-to-N, N-to-1, N-to-N). This moves beyond fixed interaction patterns by allowing filters to adapt to specific relations. Similarly, \cite{xie2020} introduced ReInceptionE, which combines an Inception network for enhanced interaction learning with a relation-aware attention mechanism. This dual approach enriches query embeddings by incorporating both local neighborhood and global entity information, thereby capturing comprehensive structural context. In a specialized application, \cite{yang2025} developed SEConv for healthcare prediction, integrating a resource-efficient self-attention mechanism with a multi-layer CNN to learn deeper and more informative structural features from medical knowledge graph triplets.

The advent of Transformer architectures, with their powerful self-attention mechanisms, has further pushed the boundaries of KGE by enabling the modeling of global dependencies and complex relational semantics. These models are particularly adept at processing sequential data, and their adaptation to graph structures allows for a flexible, data-driven approach to feature learning. For instance, \cite{yang2023} presented CKGE, a Contextualized Knowledge Graph Embedding model for explainable recommendations. This model constructs meta-graphs for talent-course pairs and employs a specialized KG-based Transformer that leverages relational attention and structural encoding to capture global dependencies and motivation-aware context, providing explicit explanations through local path mask prediction. A more direct application of the Transformer paradigm to KGE is the TGformer framework by \cite{shi2025}. TGformer is a novel Graph Transformer that constructs context-level subgraphs for predicted triplets, explicitly modeling inter-triplet relationships. It utilizes a Knowledge Graph Transformer Network (KGTN) to comprehensively explore multi-structural features, encompassing both fine-grained triplet-level and broader graph-level information, and extends its applicability to both static and temporal knowledge graphs.

These advanced neural architectures significantly boost representational power by moving beyond the predefined scoring functions and rigid geometric operations of earlier models like TransE \cite{ji2015}, TransH \cite{wang2014}, TransMS \cite{yang2019}, TorusE \cite{ebisu2017}, CompoundE \cite{ge2022}, HousE \cite{li2022}, SpherE \cite{li2024}, FHRE \cite{liang2024}, and HolmE \cite{zheng2024}. While geometric models offer interpretability and efficiency for certain relation types, they often struggle with highly complex, non-linear interactions, multi-hop reasoning, and inductive settings. For example, translation-based models are inherently limited in handling 1-N, N-1, or N-N relations, and even more advanced rotation-based or hyperbolic models, while excelling at symmetry or hierarchy, still operate within fixed mathematical frameworks. GNNs and Transformers, by learning features directly from data and dynamically aggregating information, offer greater flexibility, expressiveness, and the ability to generalize to unseen entities and complex relational patterns, thereby addressing critical limitations of their predecessors.

In conclusion, the integration of Graph Neural Networks and Transformers into KGE represents a significant advancement, enabling models to learn complex, non-linear features and capture rich contextual and multi-structural information. While these models offer superior expressiveness and inductive capabilities, challenges remain in optimizing their computational efficiency for extremely large-scale KGs, enhancing their interpretability, and further exploring their application to dynamic and heterogeneous knowledge graphs. Future research will likely focus on hybrid architectures that combine the strengths of different neural components, develop more efficient attention mechanisms, and design models that can adaptively leverage diverse structural and semantic cues for robust knowledge representation.
