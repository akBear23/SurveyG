\section{Dynamic, Inductive, and Distributed KGE}
\label{sec:dynamic_inductive_and_distributed_kge}

While the preceding section demonstrated how integrating auxiliary information, logical rules, and multi-modal data enriches Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE) by enhancing their semantic depth and robustness, these advancements largely operate within a static and centralized paradigm. However, real-world knowledge graphs are inherently dynamic, constantly evolving with new facts, entities, and relations, and are often distributed across various sources. This section therefore shifts our focus to address these critical challenges, moving beyond static and centralized assumptions to explore KGE models that are adaptable, scalable, and secure in complex operational environments.

We delve into three crucial dimensions that define modern KGE research. First, we examine \textit{Temporal Knowledge Graph Embedding (TKGE)}, which explicitly models the temporal dynamics of knowledge, capturing how entities and relations evolve over time \cite{community_4, 83d58bc46b7adb92d8750da52313f060b10f201d}. This is vital for understanding the fluidity of real-world knowledge and enabling reasoning over historical and future events. Second, the section explores \textit{Inductive and Continual KGE}, addressing the challenge of learning embeddings for unseen entities and efficiently updating models with new facts without requiring full retraining \cite{community_1, 8f096071a09701012c9c279aee2a88143a295935}. These methods are paramount for ensuring KGE models can adapt to the ever-growing nature of knowledge bases and mitigate issues like catastrophic forgetting. Finally, we investigate \textit{Federated and Privacy-Preserving KGE}, which enables collaborative learning across distributed knowledge sources while safeguarding sensitive data \cite{community_1, 8c93f3cecf79bd9f8d021f589d095305e281dd2f}. This emerging area is crucial for deploying KGE in privacy-sensitive, decentralized settings. Collectively, these advancements are essential for making KGE models truly operational, capable of meeting the demands of modern, dynamic, and distributed knowledge management systems.
