\section{Introduction}
Knowledge representation has undergone a significant evolution, progressing from early semantic networks to the sophisticated, large-scale knowledge graphs (KGs) that now underpin many intelligent systems. While KGs like Freebase, DBpedia, and Wikidata offer a powerful means to organize and structure world knowledge symbolically, they inherently face challenges such as data sparsity, incompleteness, and computational inefficiencies in capturing nuanced semantic similarities and performing scalable reasoning. These limitations have historically hindered their seamless integration with modern machine learning paradigms.

This review introduces Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE) as a pivotal paradigm shift designed to overcome these obstacles. KGE transforms discrete, symbolic entities and relations into continuous, low-dimensional vector spaces, thereby converting complex symbolic problems into efficient vector operations. This transformation makes knowledge machine-understandable and actionable for diverse artificial intelligence tasks. This introductory section establishes the foundational context for KGE, beginning with an exploration of the historical evolution of knowledge representation and the fundamental structure of knowledge graphs. We then delve into the core motivations driving the development of embedding methods, highlighting how they address the shortcomings of traditional symbolic approaches by enabling scalability, facilitating semantic reasoning, and enhancing performance in tasks such as link prediction, entity alignment, and question answering. The subsequent subsections will delineate the comprehensive scope and organizational structure of this review, guiding the reader through the intricate landscape of KGE research, from foundational geometric models to advanced deep learning architectures, practical considerations, and real-world applications. By providing this essential background, this introduction aims to illuminate the significance and trajectory of KGE within the broader field of artificial intelligence, underscoring its transformative role in converting complex knowledge into a format amenable to advanced computational analysis.
