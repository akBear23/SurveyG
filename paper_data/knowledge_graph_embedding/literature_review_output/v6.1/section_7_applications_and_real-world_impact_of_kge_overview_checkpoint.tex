\label{sec:applications_and_real-world_impact_of_kge}

Having explored the foundational models, advanced architectures, and critical practical considerations—including efficiency, robustness, and rigorous evaluation—that underpin the development of effective Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models, this section shifts focus from theoretical advancements and operational viability to the tangible outcomes and transformative potential of KGE in diverse real-world scenarios. It serves as a crucial demonstration of how the sophisticated embedding techniques discussed throughout this review are not merely academic constructs but powerful tools leveraged to address complex challenges across various artificial intelligence applications. We delve into the significant impact of KGE in core tasks such as link prediction and knowledge graph completion, where embeddings facilitate the inference of missing facts and enhance the completeness of knowledge bases \cite{layer_1, community_0}. Furthermore, this section highlights KGE's pivotal role in entity alignment, enabling the seamless integration of heterogeneous information from disparate knowledge sources \cite{community_5}. Beyond these foundational tasks, we examine how KGE models empower more intelligent systems, from enhancing question answering over structured knowledge to personalizing recommender systems, bridging the gap between natural language understanding and structured data \cite{community_1, community_3}. Finally, we explore a range of domain-specific applications, illustrating KGE's practical utility in specialized industries, often emphasizing the growing demand for explainable and verifiable insights \cite{community_2, community_6}. This section collectively underscores the broad applicability and profound real-world benefits that KGE brings to modern AI systems, showcasing its capacity to unlock deeper insights and drive innovation across numerous fields.
