\section{Efficiency, Scalability, and Robustness in KGE}
The practical deployment of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models in real-world scenarios necessitates addressing critical challenges related to their efficiency, scalability, and robustness. As knowledge graphs (KGs) grow in size, complexity, and dynamism, and as they are increasingly utilized in distributed and privacy-sensitive environments, the demand for KGE models that are not only accurate but also resource-efficient, adaptable, and resilient to imperfections becomes paramount. This section delves into the cutting-edge research directions that tackle these practical hurdles, moving from optimizing model parameters and training processes to enabling privacy-preserving federated learning, facilitating continuous adaptation to evolving KGs, enhancing data quality awareness, and improving the models' fundamental ability to extrapolate and generalize to unseen knowledge. The progression of research, particularly evident in recent years, highlights a concerted effort to transition KGE from theoretical efficacy to practical deployability, ensuring that these powerful representation learning techniques can meet the demands of dynamic, large-scale, and often noisy real-world data.

\subsection{Parameter and Storage Optimization}
The sheer scale of modern knowledge graphs poses a significant challenge for KGE models, as the number of embedding parameters often scales linearly with the number of entities and relations. This parameter explosion leads to substantial storage requirements and computational overhead, hindering deployment on resource-constrained devices or in distributed learning settings. Consequently, parameter and storage optimization has become a crucial area of research.

One prominent approach to mitigate this issue is **Entity-Agnostic Representation Learning (EARL)** \cite{chen2023}. Unlike conventional KGE methods that learn a unique embedding for every entity, EARL proposes a paradigm shift by learning embeddings for only a small, pre-selected set of "reserved entities." For all other entities, it employs universal, entity-agnostic encoders to compose their representations from "distinguishable information," such as connected relation patterns (ConRel), proximity to reserved entities (kNResEnt), and multi-hop neighbor information (MulHop). This compositional approach ensures a static and efficient parameter count that does not scale with KG size, achieving competitive link prediction performance with significantly fewer parameters. Beyond EARL, other strategies include **knowledge distillation**, where a smaller, more efficient student model learns from a larger, more complex teacher model. For instance, \cite{zhu2020} introduced DualDE, which dually distills knowledge graph embeddings for faster and cheaper reasoning. Similarly, **embedding compression** techniques, such as those explored by \cite{sachan2020} and \cite{wang2021}, aim to reduce the memory footprint of embeddings through methods like quantization or pruning. While these methods effectively reduce storage and computational demands, a critical consideration is the potential trade-off between parameter efficiency and model expressiveness, especially for highly complex or sparse KGs. The challenge lies in designing compact representations that retain sufficient semantic information to maintain high predictive accuracy.

\subsection{Training and System Optimization}
Optimizing the training process and underlying system infrastructure is paramount for handling the ever-growing scale of knowledge graphs and the increasing complexity of KGE models. Efficient training directly impacts the feasibility of deploying KGE in real-world applications, where rapid model updates and processing of massive datasets are often required.

Recent advancements have focused on both algorithmic and system-level improvements. From an algorithmic perspective, **CPa-WAC (Constellation Partitioning-based Scalable Weighted Aggregation Composition)** \cite{modak2024} addresses scalability for GNN-based KGE models by employing modularity maximization-based constellation partitioning. This technique breaks down large KGs into smaller, manageable subgraphs, allowing for parallel processing and significantly reducing training time and memory costs while preserving accuracy. This method offers a structural optimization for large-scale graph processing. Complementing such algorithmic strategies, **GE2 (A General and Efficient Knowledge Graph Embedding Learning System)** \cite{zheng2024} focuses on system-level optimization. GE2 tackles common bottlenecks like long CPU times and high CPU-GPU communication overhead, especially in multi-GPU environments. It introduces a general execution model for negative sampling and a novel algorithm (COVER) for efficient data swap between CPU and multiple GPUs, minimizing communication costs. This system-centric approach ensures that KGE models, regardless of their architectural complexity, can be trained with maximum hardware efficiency. Furthermore, the efficiency of negative sampling, a crucial component of KGE training, has been a long-standing research area, with works like \cite{zhang2018} and \cite{li2021} proposing methods for more effective and efficient negative sample generation. The continuous drive for optimization also includes techniques like parallel training \cite{kochsiek2021}, which leverages distributed computing to speed up the learning process. These efforts collectively aim to make KGE training faster, cheaper, and more accessible for large-scale deployments, though careful tuning of hyperparameters remains critical for optimal performance \cite{lloyd2022}.

\subsection{Federated Knowledge Graph Embedding (FKGE)}
The increasing demand for privacy-preserving and distributed machine learning has led to the emergence of Federated Knowledge Graph Embedding (FKGE). FKGE enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a KGE model without sharing their raw, sensitive local KG data, thereby addressing data privacy concerns and leveraging distributed computational resources. However, this paradigm introduces unique challenges related to communication efficiency, personalization, and security.

\subsubsection{Communication Efficiency}
A primary practical bottleneck in FKGE is the substantial communication overhead. Clients typically upload their local model updates to a central server, and the server broadcasts aggregated global models back to clients. With large KGE models and numerous communication rounds, this can be prohibitively expensive. To address this, **FedS (Communication-Efficient Federated Knowledge Graph Embedding with Entity-Wise Top-K Sparsification)** \cite{zhang2024} proposes a bidirectional communication-efficient FKGE model. FedS innovates by allowing clients to upload and download only the Top-K changed or aggregated embeddings, rather than the entire model parameters. This significantly reduces the amount of data transmitted in each round. Furthermore, it incorporates an Intermittent Synchronization Mechanism to mitigate embedding inconsistency among shared entities, which can arise from sparse updates. This approach directly tackles the practical challenge of deploying FKGE in bandwidth-constrained environments, making federated learning for KGs more viable. However, the choice of K (the number of top embeddings) introduces a trade-off: a smaller K reduces communication but might lead to slower convergence or reduced model accuracy due to information loss.

\subsubsection{Personalization}
Another critical challenge in FKGE arises from the inherent heterogeneity of data across different clients. Clients often possess KGs with distinct semantic characteristics, entity distributions, and relational patterns. Existing FKGE methods, which often rely on simple arithmetic averaging for global model aggregation, tend to neglect these semantic disparities, leading to sub-optimal performance for individual clients. To overcome this, **PFedEG (Personalized Federated Knowledge Graph Embedding with Client-Wise Relation Graph)** \cite{zhang2024} introduces a novel approach that moves beyond generic global knowledge. PFedEG employs a **client-wise relation graph** to learn personalized embeddings. It amalgamates entity embeddings from "neighboring" clients based on their "affinity" on this graph, thereby providing personalized supplementary knowledge for each client. This client-wise aggregation strategy allows the model to capture the unique semantic context of each client while still benefiting from collaborative learning. By tailoring the aggregation process to account for client-specific characteristics, PFedEG enhances the quality of personalized embeddings, leading to improved performance compared to non-personalized federated approaches. The challenge here lies in effectively defining and learning client affinities without compromising privacy or introducing excessive computational complexity.

\subsubsection{Security and Attacks}
As FKGE gains traction, its security vulnerabilities become a critical concern. The distributed nature of federated learning, while offering privacy benefits, also opens new avenues for malicious actors to compromise the integrity and confidentiality of the learned model. **"Poisoning Attack on Federated Knowledge Graph Embedding"** \cite{zhou2024} represents a pioneering work that systematically investigates the risks of poisoning attacks in FKGE. This study develops a novel framework where attackers can infer target relations in a victim's local KG and then use a shadow model with an optimized dynamic poisoning scheme to generate malicious updates. These malicious updates, when aggregated by the central server, can subtly corrupt the global KGE model, leading to incorrect predictions or biased representations. This research highlights that even with data privacy, the federated learning paradigm is not immune to adversarial manipulations. Understanding these attack vectors is crucial for developing robust defense mechanisms and ensuring the trustworthiness of FKGE systems. The ongoing "arms race" between attack and defense mechanisms in federated learning underscores the need for continuous research into secure aggregation protocols, anomaly detection, and robust training strategies to safeguard KGE models in distributed environments.

\subsection{Inductive Learning and Continual Learning for Evolving KGs}
Real-world knowledge graphs are inherently dynamic, with new entities, relations, and facts constantly emerging. Traditional KGE models are often transductive, meaning they can only embed entities and relations seen during training, and require costly retraining for updates. This limitation necessitates the development of inductive and continual learning capabilities to handle continuously evolving KGs efficiently.

**Inductive learning** focuses on enabling KGE models to generalize to unseen entities or relations without retraining the entire model. Early efforts, such as \cite{wang2018}'s Logic Attention Based Neighborhood Aggregation, explored using graph neural networks to compose embeddings for new entities from their neighborhood structures. More recently, **MetaHG (Learning Dynamic Knowledge Graph Embedding in Evolving Service Ecosystems via Meta-Learning)** \cite{sun2024} introduces a meta-learning strategy specifically for dynamic KGE. MetaHG addresses the challenge of efficiently updating incremental knowledge and representing **unseen entities** by learning to adapt quickly to new temporal snapshots. It mitigates spatial deformation by incorporating both local (GNN) and potential global (Hypergraph Neural Network - HGNN) structural information from KG snapshots. This meta-learning approach allows the model to generalize to new entities and relations by leveraging learned meta-knowledge, rather than requiring full retraining.

**Continual learning** (also known as incremental learning) focuses on updating KGE models with new knowledge over time without suffering from "catastrophic forgetting," where the model loses previously learned information. **FastKGE (Fast and Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding via Incremental LoRA)** \cite{liu2024} offers a significant advancement in this area. FastKGE employs an **Incremental Low-Rank Adapter (IncLoRA)** mechanism, which efficiently acquires new knowledge and preserves old knowledge by isolating and allocating new knowledge to specific layers based on influence. It utilizes parameter-efficient low-rank adapters for fine-tuning and adaptively allocates rank based on entity importance. This addresses both catastrophic forgetting and the efficiency of learning in continuously growing KGs, making KGE models more adaptable to real-world, dynamic scenarios. The development path in this area moves towards KGE systems that can seamlessly integrate new information, learn from evolving patterns, and maintain high performance without constant, expensive retraining.

\subsection{Error-Awareness and Data Quality}
Real-world knowledge graphs are often constructed automatically or through crowdsourcing, leading to inherent noise, incompleteness, and erroneous triples. Training KGE models on such imperfect data can significantly degrade their performance and reliability. Therefore, developing error-aware KGE models that can identify and mitigate the impact of low-quality data is crucial for robust deployment.

A notable contribution in this direction is **AEKE (Attributed Error-aware Knowledge Embedding)** \cite{zhang2024}. AEKE proposes a novel framework that leverages **entity attributes** to guide KGE model learning and effectively mitigate the impact of erroneous triples. It constructs triple-level hypergraphs for both the KG and its attributes and calculates a **confidence score** for each triple. These scores are derived from self-contradiction, structural consistency, and attribute-structure homogeneity, providing a robust indicator of triple quality. These confidence scores are then used to adaptively weight aggregation in multi-view graph learning and the margin loss, effectively reducing the influence of potentially incorrect triples during training. This allows AEKE to learn more reliable embeddings by actively down-weighting noisy information. Earlier work by \cite{shan2018} also introduced a confidence-aware negative sampling method to improve KGE in noisy environments, demonstrating the importance of handling data quality during the training process. Furthermore, broader strategies for robustness, such as multi-task reinforcement learning \cite{zhang2021} and bilevel optimization for mitigating the long-tail problem \cite{zhang2023}, indirectly contribute to handling data quality issues by making models more resilient to data imbalances and inconsistencies. The challenge in error-awareness lies in accurately identifying erroneous triples without relying on perfect ground truth, which is often unavailable.

\subsection{Extrapolation and Generalization}
The ability of KGE models to extrapolate to unseen facts and generalize effectively to new patterns is a hallmark of true intelligence and a critical requirement for real-world applications. This involves not just predicting missing links within the observed graph structure (transductive learning) but inferring knowledge beyond it (inductive learning) and understanding complex relational compositions.

A significant theoretical and practical advancement in this area is **HolmE (Knowledge graph embedding closed under composition)** \cite{zheng2024}. HolmE is a pioneering KGE model designed with its **relation embedding space explicitly closed under composition**. This property ensures that the composition of any two relation embeddings remains within the space, enabling every relation to compose or be composed. This is specifically aimed at enhancing the modeling of **under-represented (long-tail) composition patterns** and improving the model's capability to **extrapolate to unseen relations** through composition. By providing a strong theoretical guarantee for compositional reasoning, HolmE pushes KGE towards more robust and generalizable inference. Complementing this, **MQuinE (a Cure for “Z-paradox” in Knowledge Graph Embedding)** \cite{liu2024} addresses and rectifies a previously identified fundamental deficiency (the "Z-paradox") in the expressiveness of some popular KGE models. MQuinE ensures strong expressiveness for various relation patterns (symmetric/asymmetric, inverse, 1-N/N-1/N-N, composition) with rigorous theoretical justification, thereby improving the foundational ability of KGE models to capture diverse relational semantics accurately. Beyond these, other works have explored how KGE models extrapolate from a semantic evidence view \cite{li2021} or focus on capturing diverse relational patterns through different embedding spaces, such as those proposed by \cite{peng2020} (LineaRE) for its simplicity and power in modeling relational connectivity. The continuous drive for better extrapolation and generalization capabilities is crucial for KGE models to move beyond mere pattern recognition and perform genuine knowledge discovery and reasoning in complex, evolving environments.
