\section*{10. Conclusion}
This comprehensive literature review has explored the multifaceted landscape of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE), highlighting its significant advancements and diverse contributions to the field of Artificial Intelligence. From its foundational models to the most sophisticated contemporary architectures, KGE has consistently demonstrated a transformative role in enhancing various AI applications, ranging from fundamental tasks like link prediction and entity alignment to complex systems for question answering and recommendation. The evolution of KGE models reflects a continuous drive towards greater expressiveness, efficiency, scalability, and robustness, underscoring its enduring potential as a vibrant and evolving research area at the forefront of knowledge representation and reasoning.

The journey of KGE began with foundational models that sought to embed entities and relations into low-dimensional vector spaces, primarily using translational distance or semantic matching paradigms. Early models like TransE and its variants (e.g., TransH \cite{wang2014}, TransD \cite{ji2015}, TransA \cite{jia2015}) laid the groundwork by interpreting relations as translations, while others like DistMult and ComplEx focused on semantic matching. These initial efforts, as summarized by various surveys \cite{dai2020, yan2022, cao2022}, established the core principles of KGE. However, they often struggled with capturing complex relational patterns such as symmetry, inversion, and composition. This led to the development of more expressive geometric models, exemplified by RotatE \cite{sun2018}, which models relations as rotations in complex space, effectively addressing these patterns. Further theoretical advancements have pushed the boundaries of expressiveness, with models like HolmE \cite{zheng2024} ensuring relation embedding spaces are "closed under composition" for robust compositional reasoning, and MQuinE \cite{liu2024} rectifying fundamental expressiveness deficiencies (the "Z-paradox") in popular KGE models. The field has also moved beyond simple point embeddings, with SpherE \cite{li2024} representing entities as spheres to better model many-to-many relations and enable novel tasks like set retrieval.

The transformative impact of KGE is evident across a wide spectrum of AI applications. In **link prediction**, KGE models are crucial for identifying missing facts within incomplete knowledge graphs \cite{rossi2020}. For **entity alignment**, KGE has proven instrumental in integrating heterogeneous knowledge graphs, with methods like BootEA \cite{sun2018} leveraging semi-supervised bootstrapping to overcome data scarcity, and OntoEA \cite{xiang2021} incorporating rich ontological schema information for more accurate mappings. The utility extends to **question answering (QA)**, where KGE-based approaches like KEQA \cite{huang2019} and hybrid systems combining KGE with Large Language Models (LLMs) such as "Marie and BERT" \cite{zhou2023} enhance the ability to answer natural language questions over KGs. Furthermore, KGE has significantly advanced **recommender systems**, addressing challenges like data sparsity and cold start. Models like RKGE \cite{sun2018} learn semantic representations of paths to characterize user preferences, while CKGE \cite{yang2023} integrates contextualized information for explainable recommendations, and CKGCE \cite{liu2023} tackles cross-domain recommendation challenges. Beyond these, KGE finds applications in specialized domains such as **healthcare prediction** \cite{yang2025, islam2023}, demonstrating its versatility.

The continuous evolution of KGE has been marked by persistent efforts to address critical challenges related to efficiency, scalability, and robustness. For **scalability and efficiency**, particularly with massive and dynamic KGs, parameter-efficient approaches like Entity-Agnostic Representation Learning (EARL) \cite{chen2023} have emerged, significantly reducing parameter counts while maintaining performance. The dynamic nature of knowledge has spurred the development of temporal KGE models, from early works like HyTE \cite{dasgupta2018} and ATiSE \cite{xu2019} to more advanced multi-curvature embeddings (MADE \cite{wang2024}, IME \cite{wang2024}, MGTCA \cite{shang2024}) and meta-learning strategies for continual KGE (FastKGE \cite{liu2024}, MetaHG \cite{sun2024}). System-level optimizations, such as GE2 \cite{zheng2024} for efficient multi-GPU training and graph partitioning techniques like CPa-WAC \cite{modak2024}, further underscore the commitment to practical deployment. **Robustness** to noisy data and adversarial attacks is another critical area. Confidence-aware negative sampling \cite{shan2018} and error-aware frameworks like AEKE \cite{zhang2024} leverage auxiliary information to mitigate the impact of erroneous triples. The rise of Federated KGE (FKGE) has also brought new challenges, with research actively investigating poisoning attacks \cite{zhou2024} and developing communication-efficient \cite{zhang2024} and personalized \cite{zhang2024} FKGE solutions. The integration of advanced neural architectures, particularly Graph Transformers like TGformer \cite{shi2025}, promises a unifying framework for handling multi-level structural features in both static and temporal KGs.

In conclusion, Knowledge Graph Embedding remains a vibrant and rapidly evolving research area. The progression from foundational models to advanced architectures, the integration of rich auxiliary information, and the continuous efforts to address efficiency, scalability, and robustness collectively highlight KGE's enduring potential. Future innovations will likely continue to push boundaries by integrating multimodal and cross-domain information \cite{liu2023, zhang2023}, leveraging the power of Large Language Models \cite{ge2023, shen2022} for deeper semantic understanding, and prioritizing ethical considerations and explainability \cite{yang2023} to build trustworthy AI systems. KGE is poised to drive future innovations at the forefront of knowledge representation and reasoning, enabling more intelligent, adaptable, and robust AI applications across diverse domains.
