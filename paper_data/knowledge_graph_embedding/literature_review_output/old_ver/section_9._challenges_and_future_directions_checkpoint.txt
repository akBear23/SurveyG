\section*{9. Challenges and Future Directions}
Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) has made significant strides in representing complex relational data in low-dimensional spaces, enabling numerous downstream applications. However, the field is still confronted with substantial challenges, particularly when transitioning from controlled academic benchmarks to the immense scale, dynamic nature, and inherent imperfections of real-world knowledge graphs (KGs). Future innovations in KGE must navigate these complexities, pushing the boundaries of model expressiveness, ensuring robustness, and integrating with emerging AI paradigms like Large Language Models (LLMs). This section synthesizes the current limitations and outlines a roadmap for future research, emphasizing the critical need for scalable, interpretable, and ethically sound KGE systems.

\subsection*{Scalability for Massive and Dynamic KGs}
The sheer scale and dynamic nature of real-world KGs pose significant challenges for KGE models. Traditional KGE methods often struggle with parameter explosion as the number of entities and relations grows, leading to high storage costs and computational demands \cite{chen2023}. To address this, parameter-efficient approaches like Entity-Agnostic Representation Learning (EARL) \cite{chen2023} have emerged, which learn embeddings for a small set of reserved entities and encode others compositionally, demonstrating competitive performance with significantly fewer parameters. Beyond static scale, KGs are constantly evolving, with new facts being added and old ones becoming invalid. Early temporal KGE models like HyTE \cite{dasgupta2018} and ATiSE \cite{xu2019} introduced time-awareness, but more recent efforts focus on continual learning and handling complex temporal dynamics. For instance, FastKGE \cite{liu2024} employs an Incremental Low-Rank Adapter (IncLoRA) mechanism for efficient continual KGE, mitigating catastrophic forgetting in evolving KGs. Similarly, MetaHG \cite{sun2024} leverages meta-learning to adapt to dynamic service ecosystems and handle unseen entities. The development of scalable systems like GE2 \cite{zheng2024}, which optimizes CPU-GPU communication and data management for multi-GPU training, and graph partitioning strategies like CPa-WAC \cite{modak2024}, further underscores the critical need for efficient and adaptable KGE solutions for massive and dynamic KGs. Looking ahead, Graph Transformer frameworks like TGformer \cite{shi2025} aim to integrate multi-level structural features in both static and temporal KGs, offering a unifying architectural approach for dynamic knowledge.

\subsection*{Enhanced Expressiveness and Interpretability}
The pursuit of enhanced model expressiveness remains a core challenge, alongside the growing demand for interpretability. Many KGE models, particularly early translational and semantic matching approaches, struggle to capture complex relational patterns such as symmetry, inversion, and composition comprehensively \cite{sun2018}. Recent advancements explore richer mathematical spaces and geometric operations. For example, RotatE \cite{sun2018} models relations as rotations in complex space, effectively capturing various patterns. Further pushing this boundary, HolmE \cite{zheng2024} proposes a KGE model with a relation embedding space explicitly "closed under composition," ensuring robust modeling of under-represented compositional patterns and extrapolation to unseen relations. The "Z-paradox," a deficiency in the expressiveness of some popular KGE models, has been identified and addressed by MQuinE \cite{liu2024}, ensuring stronger theoretical guarantees for various relation types. Beyond point embeddings, SpherE \cite{li2024} represents entities as spheres, offering a more expressive way to model many-to-many relations and enabling novel tasks like set retrieval. While these advancements boost expressiveness, maintaining interpretability is crucial. Models like LineaRE \cite{peng2020} emphasize simplicity while capturing diverse relational semantics. Furthermore, the integration of multi-curvature spaces, as seen in MADE \cite{wang2024} and IME \cite{wang2024} for temporal KGs, allows for adaptive modeling of diverse geometric structures, contributing to both expressiveness and a more nuanced understanding of underlying data properties.

\subsection*{Robustness to Noise and Adversarial Attacks}
Real-world KGs are inherently noisy and susceptible to data imperfections, which can significantly degrade the performance of KGE models. Moreover, the increasing deployment of KGE in sensitive applications necessitates robustness against malicious adversarial attacks. Addressing data noise has been a continuous effort. Early work by \cite{shan2018} introduced confidence-aware negative sampling to mitigate the impact of noisy triples during training. More recently, AEKE \cite{zhang2024} proposes an "error-aware" framework that leverages entity attributes to calculate confidence scores for triples, adaptively weighting their contribution to reduce the influence of erroneous data. This approach moves beyond simple noise filtering to actively integrate auxiliary information for more reliable embeddings. The rise of federated learning for KGE, driven by privacy concerns and distributed data, introduces new security vulnerabilities. The pioneering work by \cite{zhou2024} systematically investigates poisoning attacks on Federated KGE (FKGE), developing a framework where attackers can infer target relations and generate malicious updates to compromise the aggregated model. This highlights a critical future direction: developing robust FKGE systems that are not only communication-efficient \cite{zhang2024} and personalized \cite{zhang2024} but also resilient to sophisticated adversarial manipulations. Future research must focus on developing robust training methodologies, including advanced negative sampling strategies \cite{madushanka2024}, and defense mechanisms to ensure the integrity and reliability of KGE models in adversarial environments.

\subsection*{Multimodal and Cross-Domain KGE}
The richness of real-world knowledge often extends beyond symbolic triples, encompassing various modalities and spanning multiple domains. Integrating these diverse information sources is a key future direction for KGE. Multimodal KGE aims to fuse information from text, images, audio, and other data types to create more comprehensive and semantically rich embeddings. For instance, \cite{zhu2022} explored multimodal reasoning for specific diseases, demonstrating how KGE can integrate diverse clinical data to enhance diagnostic capabilities. The challenge lies in effectively aligning and combining features from heterogeneous modalities. Modality-Aware Negative Sampling (MANS) \cite{zhang2023} is an example of how training strategies are being adapted for multimodal KGE. Similarly, cross-domain KGE seeks to bridge knowledge gaps between disparate KGs or application domains. For entity alignment, multi-view KGE frameworks \cite{zhang2019} unify entity names, relations, and attributes to learn more robust mappings. In recommender systems, CKGCE \cite{liu2023} addresses the cross-domain cold start problem by introducing a "chiasmal embedding" approach with a binding rule to facilitate efficient interaction between items from diverse domains. This allows for more holistic recommendation experiences. The future will see KGE models increasingly capable of seamlessly integrating information across various modalities and domains, leading to more complete, nuanced, and versatile knowledge representations that can power complex AI applications.

\subsection*{Integration with Large Language Models (LLMs)}
The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language understanding and generation, presenting a critical opportunity for their integration with KGE. LLMs excel at capturing rich textual semantics and contextual nuances, which can significantly enhance the symbolic and structural knowledge captured by KGEs \cite{ge2023}. This synergy can address KGE's limitations in handling unstructured text and provide LLMs with structured factual knowledge, mitigating issues like hallucination. Early integrations, such as the "Marie and BERT" system \cite{zhou2023} for chemistry QA, demonstrate how combining BERT's semantic understanding with KGE's structured reasoning can achieve high performance in domain-specific question answering. Future directions involve more sophisticated joint learning frameworks where KGE can provide structural constraints and factual grounding to LLMs, while LLMs enrich KGEs with deeper semantic understanding and textual context \cite{shen2022}. For instance, SEConv \cite{yang2025} leverages AI-generated content (AIGC) for semantic enhancement within medical KGs, illustrating how LLM-driven content generation can enrich KGEs for specialized applications. Challenges include aligning the continuous embedding spaces of LLMs with the discrete symbolic structures of KGs, managing computational costs, and ensuring that the integration leads to truly interpretable and robust knowledge systems.

\subsection*{Ethical Considerations and Explainable AI}
As KGE systems become more powerful and are deployed in high-stakes domains like healthcare and talent management, ethical considerations and the demand for Explainable AI (XAI) become paramount. KGE models, especially deep learning-based ones, can often operate as "black boxes," making it difficult to understand *why* a particular prediction or recommendation was made. This lack of transparency can erode trust, hinder debugging, and mask potential biases embedded in the training data. Explainable KGE aims to provide insights into the reasoning process. For example, CKGE \cite{yang2023} for talent training course recommendation explicitly integrates "motivation-aware information" and uses local path mask prediction to highlight the saliency of meta-paths, offering clear explanations for recommendations. Similarly, explainable drug repurposing efforts \cite{islam2023} leverage KGE to not only identify drug candidates but also to provide insights into underlying molecular mechanisms. Future research must prioritize the development of inherently interpretable KGE models or robust post-hoc explanation techniques. Ethical considerations extend to fairness, privacy, and accountability. KGE systems must be designed to mitigate biases present in KGs, ensure data privacy (especially in federated settings \cite{zhang2024}), and provide mechanisms for auditing and accountability. The goal is to build KGE systems that are not only accurate and efficient but also transparent, fair, and trustworthy, aligning with broader responsible AI principles.
