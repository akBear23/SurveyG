\label{sec:applications_and_real_world_impact_of_kge}

Following the discussion on practical considerations for KGE models in Section \ref{sec:practical_considerations_efficiency_robustness_and_evaluation}, which focused on ensuring their efficiency, robustness, and rigorous evaluation, this section shifts its attention to the tangible outcomes and widespread utility of these advancements. Here, we move beyond theoretical developments to showcase the diverse and significant real-world impact of knowledge graph embedding across various artificial intelligence applications. KGE models are no longer confined to academic benchmarks; they are actively leveraged to address complex problems across numerous domains, demonstrating their transformative potential in modern AI systems.

The subsequent subsections will delve into how KGE underpins fundamental tasks such as \textit{link prediction and knowledge graph completion}, which are crucial for enhancing the completeness and inferential capabilities of knowledge bases \cite{community_0, community_1}. We will then explore its vital role in \textit{entity alignment}, enabling the seamless integration of heterogeneous knowledge sources by identifying equivalent entities across disparate graphs \cite{community_5}. Furthermore, this section highlights the application of KGE in enhancing user-facing AI systems, specifically in improving the intelligence and personalization of \textit{question answering} and \textit{recommender systems} \cite{community_1, community_3}. Finally, we will examine various \textit{domain-specific applications}, from biological systems to patent analysis, emphasizing how KGE models are tailored to solve industry-specific challenges and often incorporate principles of \textit{explainability} to build trust and provide actionable insights \cite{community_2, community_6}. This comprehensive overview illustrates the practical utility, tangible benefits, and broad applicability of knowledge graph embedding techniques, underscoring their indispensable contribution to the evolution of intelligent systems that can effectively understand, reason with, and leverage vast amounts of structured knowledge.
