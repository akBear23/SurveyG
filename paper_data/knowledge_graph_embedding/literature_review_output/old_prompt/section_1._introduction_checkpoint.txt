\section*{1. Introduction}

Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have emerged as a cornerstone of modern Artificial Intelligence, providing a structured and interconnected representation of real-world entities and their relationships. They are instrumental in organizing vast, heterogeneous information, powering diverse applications from semantic search and question answering to recommendation systems and scientific discovery \cite{wang2017zm5, dai2020, choudhary2021, yan2022, ge2023}. However, the inherent symbolic nature of KGs, while offering interpretability, presents significant challenges for large-scale computational tasks, scalability, and seamless integration with contemporary machine learning paradigms. This foundational limitation has spurred the development of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) techniques, which transform symbolic entities and relations into low-dimensional, continuous vector spaces. KGEs address the critical need for efficient computation, improved scalability, and enhanced compatibility with data-driven AI models, thereby unlocking the full potential of KGs in complex analytical and predictive tasks \cite{cao2022, chen2023}. This literature review provides a comprehensive overview of the KGE landscape, tracing its evolution from initial translational and semantic matching models to advanced neural architectures, temporal embeddings, and robust learning strategies. It aims to synthesize the core principles, critically analyze methodological advancements, identify persistent challenges, and highlight future research trajectories in this rapidly evolving field.

\subsection*{1.1. Background: The Rise of Knowledge Graphs}
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have become indispensable assets in the landscape of modern Artificial Intelligence, serving as powerful frameworks for organizing and representing complex, real-world information \cite{wang2017zm5, dai2020}. By structuring data as interconnected entities and their relationships (triples of the form (head, relation, tail)), KGs provide a rich, semantic layer that underpins a multitude of advanced AI applications. Their prevalence stems from their ability to integrate vast amounts of structured, semi-structured, and even unstructured data into a coherent, machine-readable format, enabling more intelligent systems \cite{choudhary2021, yan2022}. For instance, KGs are central to enhancing search engine capabilities by providing semantic context \cite{xiong2017zqu}, powering sophisticated recommendation systems by modeling intricate user-item interactions \cite{sun2018, liu2019e1u, sha2019plw, yang2023}, facilitating precise question answering \cite{huang2019, zhou2023}, and accelerating scientific discovery in domains such as drug repurposing and biomedical research \cite{mohamed2020, sosa2019ih0, islam2023, djeddi2023g71}. The sheer scale of contemporary KGs, often comprising millions of entities and billions of facts (e.g., Freebase, Wikidata), underscores their importance but also highlights the inherent challenges in their manipulation and reasoning. This structured yet expansive nature makes KGs a vital component for building explainable, robust, and context-aware AI systems, moving beyond purely statistical correlations to leverage explicit knowledge \cite{daruna2022dmk, yang2023}.

\subsection*{1.2. The Imperative for Knowledge Graph Embedding}
Despite their undeniable utility, the symbolic nature of Knowledge Graphs presents inherent limitations when confronted with the demands of modern AI systems, particularly concerning computational efficiency, scalability, and seamless integration with statistical machine learning models. Traditional symbolic reasoning, while offering high interpretability and logical precision, often suffers from combinatorial explosion, making inference over large KGs computationally prohibitive \cite{gutirrezbasulto2018oi0}. Moreover, the discrete, sparse representations of symbolic KGs are ill-suited for direct input into many neural network architectures, which thrive on dense, continuous vector inputs. This fundamental impedance mismatch necessitates a transformation of KGs into a more amenable format. Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) emerges as the critical solution, projecting entities and relations into low-dimensional, continuous vector spaces (embeddings) \cite{wang2017zm5, cao2022}.

The core motivation behind KGE is multifaceted: Firstly, \textbf{efficient computation}: Representing entities and relations as vectors allows for arithmetic operations (e.g., vector addition, dot products) to model relationships, drastically reducing the computational cost of tasks like link prediction compared to symbolic rule inference \cite{zhu2020, wang2021}. For instance, translational models like TransE interpret relations as translations between entity embeddings, enabling efficient similarity calculations \cite{jia2015}. Secondly, \textbf{scalability}: KGE models can handle vast KGs by learning compact representations, avoiding the sparsity issues and memory overhead associated with one-hot encodings or large adjacency matrices. Recent advancements even focus on parameter-efficient KGEs, where the model parameters do not scale linearly with the number of entities, making deployment on resource-constrained devices feasible \cite{chen2023}. Thirdly, \textbf{seamless integration with machine learning}: Dense vector embeddings serve as powerful features that can be directly fed into various downstream machine learning models, enhancing tasks such as recommendation \cite{sun2018, yang2023}, question answering \cite{huang2019}, and entity alignment \cite{sun2018, zhang2019}. This integration bridges the gap between structured knowledge and data-driven learning, allowing models to leverage both explicit facts and learned patterns. Furthermore, KGEs can implicitly capture complex relational patterns, including temporal dynamics \cite{dasgupta2018, xu2019} and multi-faceted entity semantics \cite{wu2021}, which are challenging for purely symbolic systems to model without extensive manual rule engineering. The ability to handle noisy or incomplete data, a common characteristic of real-world KGs, through robust embedding learning further solidifies the imperative for KGEs \cite{shan2018}.

\subsection*{1.3. Scope and Structure of the Review}
This comprehensive literature review aims to provide a structured and critical analysis of the field of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE), encompassing its foundational theories, methodological advancements, practical applications, and future challenges. The pedagogical progression of this review is designed to guide the reader from the fundamental principles of KGE to its most cutting-edge developments. We begin by categorizing KGE models based on their underlying representation spaces and scoring functions, examining seminal works that introduced translational models (e.g., TransE and its variants like TransA \cite{jia2015}), semantic matching models (e.g., DistMult, ComplEx), and their extensions.

A significant portion of this review will synthesize and critically analyze the evolution of KGE research along several key dimensions. We will explore how models have enhanced their \textbf{expressivity} to capture complex relational patterns, including symmetric, antisymmetric, and hierarchical relations, moving beyond the limitations of early models \cite{sun2018}. The persistent challenge of \textbf{scalability and efficiency} will be examined, discussing innovations ranging from optimized training strategies and negative sampling techniques \cite{shan2018, zhang2018} to parameter-efficient architectures \cite{chen2023} and federated learning approaches \cite{zhang2024}. The increasing importance of \textbf{temporal dynamics} in KGs will be a focal point, with a critical evaluation of models that integrate time into embeddings to capture evolving knowledge and predict future events \cite{dasgupta2018, xu2019}. We will also delve into methods that enhance \textbf{robustness} against noisy data and adversarial attacks, and those that improve \textbf{interpretability} and \textbf{explainability}, particularly in application-driven contexts like recommendation systems \cite{yang2023, daruna2022dmk}.

Furthermore, this review will critically compare different KGE paradigms, evaluating their methodological strengths and weaknesses, identifying underlying assumptions, and discussing trade-offs (e.g., expressivity vs. efficiency, accuracy vs. robustness). For instance, while some models achieve high accuracy on specific tasks, they might suffer from parameter explosion \cite{chen2023} or struggle with certain relation types \cite{wu2021}. We will highlight instances where experimental setups might affect generalizability \cite{lloyd2022} and discuss theoretical gaps that hinder further progress. By synthesizing disparate studies, we aim to identify evolutionary trends, potential contradictions in findings, and emerging research directions, such as the integration of KGEs with large language models \cite{liu2024q3q} and the exploration of novel geometric embedding spaces (e.g., hyperbolic, quaternion) \cite{liang2024, li2024}. Ultimately, this review seeks to provide a comprehensive, analytical foundation for researchers and practitioners navigating the complex and dynamic field of Knowledge Graph Embedding.
