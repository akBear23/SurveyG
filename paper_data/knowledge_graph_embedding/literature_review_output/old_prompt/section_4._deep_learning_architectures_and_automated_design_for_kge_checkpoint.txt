\section*{4. Deep Learning Architectures and Automated Design for KGE}

The evolution of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) has witnessed a profound paradigm shift with the integration of advanced deep learning architectures, moving beyond purely geometric or algebraic models to leverage the expressive power of neural networks. This transition marks a critical phase in the "arms race" for more accurate, robust, and adaptable KGE models, enabling them to capture increasingly complex and nuanced patterns within knowledge graphs. Deep learning methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer powerful mechanisms for local feature extraction, interaction modeling, and structural pattern recognition that were previously unattainable. Furthermore, the advent of Transformer-based models has introduced capabilities for modeling long-range dependencies and contextualized features, pushing the boundaries of KGE expressiveness. Recognizing the growing complexity of designing optimal deep learning architectures for diverse knowledge graphs, the field has also seen a significant push towards automated design and meta-learning approaches. These methods aim to reduce manual effort, enhance adaptability, and discover novel scoring functions or architectural components, collectively driving KGE research towards greater sophistication and practical applicability \cite{cao2022, ge2023, dai2020}.

\subsection*{4.1. Convolutional and Graph Neural Networks for KGE}

The application of deep learning to KGE initially saw the rise of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and subsequently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), each offering distinct advantages in capturing structural information. CNNs, traditionally successful in image processing, were adapted to KGE by treating entity-relation pairs as structured inputs amenable to convolutional filters. Models like ConvE \cite{dettmers2018conve} and ConvKB \cite{nguyen2018conve} represent triples as 2D matrices or tensors, applying convolutional filters to extract local features and interactions between entities and relations. This approach allows for the discovery of intricate patterns that might be missed by simpler translational or rotational models. For instance, \cite{hu2024} proposed a CNN-based entity-specific common feature aggregation, demonstrating its utility in learning KGEs. Similarly, \cite{ren2020} leveraged atrous convolution and residual learning to enhance feature extraction, while \cite{li2021ro5} introduced recalibration convolutional networks to improve interaction modeling. The strength of CNNs lies in their ability to learn rich, local interaction features, which can be particularly effective for capturing complex relation types. However, a methodological limitation of CNNs in KGE is their inherent assumption of grid-like input structures, which often requires reshaping graph data into fixed-size tensors, potentially losing some of the graph's irregular topology. This can limit their generalizability and expressiveness for highly diverse graph structures.

GNNs, on the other hand, are intrinsically designed to operate on graph-structured data, making them a more natural fit for KGE. They leverage message passing mechanisms to aggregate information from an entity's local neighborhood, thereby capturing complex structural patterns and multi-hop relationships. Early GNN-based KGE models, such as R-GCN \cite{schlichtkrull2018modeling}, adapted graph convolutional networks to handle the multi-relational nature of KGs by using relation-specific weight matrices. The evolution of GNNs in KGE has seen the incorporation of attention mechanisms to dynamically weigh the importance of different neighbors and relations. For example, \cite{wang2020} introduced Graph Attenuated Attention Networks, while \cite{wu2021} proposed DisenKGAT, a disentangled graph attention network that learns independent components for entities, allowing for adaptive and robust representations. DisenKGAT specifically addresses the entanglement of latent factors in entity representations by employing relation-aware aggregation for micro-disentanglement and mutual information regularization for macro-disentanglement, leading to enhanced interpretability and robustness \cite{wu2021}. This directly addresses a limitation of earlier GNNs that might learn static or entangled representations. Other works, such as \cite{sheikh20213qq}, also emphasize relation-aware attention in GCNs. Recent advancements include multi-view feature augmented neural networks \cite{jiang202235y}, multi-hierarchical aggregation GCNs \cite{liu2024tc2}, and decoupled semantic GNNs \cite{li2024bl5}, all aiming to capture richer structural and semantic contexts. While GNNs offer superior capabilities in modeling graph topology, they face challenges such as over-smoothing (where representations of distant nodes become indistinguishable after many layers) and scalability to very large KGs. The assumption that local neighborhood information is sufficient for all reasoning tasks might also be a limitation, especially for relations requiring global context.

\subsection*{4.2. Transformer-based KGE Models}

The success of Transformer architectures in natural language processing, particularly their ability to model long-range dependencies through self-attention mechanisms, has naturally extended their application to Knowledge Graph Embedding. Transformer-based KGE models represent a significant leap in capturing contextualized and multi-structural features, moving beyond the local aggregation focus of many CNN and GNN approaches. The core idea is to treat entities and relations, or paths within a knowledge graph, as sequences or sets, allowing the self-attention mechanism to weigh their interdependencies dynamically.

A notable development in this area is **TGformer (A Graph Transformer Framework for Knowledge Graph Embedding)** \cite{shi2025}, which explicitly adapts the Transformer architecture for KGE. TGformer aims to model the complex interactions between entities and relations by allowing each element to attend to all other relevant elements in its context, thereby capturing global dependencies that might be missed by local aggregation methods. This addresses a key theoretical gap in traditional GNNs, which often struggle with long-range dependencies and the potential for over-smoothing. Similarly, \cite{li2023} introduced a Position-Aware Relational Transformer, emphasizing the importance of positional information in relational sequences within KGs.

Another innovative application of Transformers is seen in **Contextualized Knowledge Graph Embedding (CKGE)** for explainable recommendations \cite{yang2023}. This work constructs specific meta-graphs for talent-course pairs, serializes entities and paths into a sequential input, and then processes this with a novel KG-based Transformer. This Transformer incorporates specialized relational attention and structural encoding to model global dependencies, and crucially, includes a local path mask prediction mechanism to reveal the saliency of meta-paths, thereby providing explainability. This highlights a critical strength of Transformers: their ability to integrate diverse contextual information and provide a degree of interpretability by quantifying attention weights. The experimental setup in \cite{yang2023} on real-world datasets demonstrated superior performance and interpretability, validating the approach.

Further advancements include **TracKGE (Transformer with Relation-pattern Adaptive Contrastive Learning for Knowledge Graph Embedding)** \cite{wang202490m}, which combines Transformer capabilities with contrastive learning to enhance embedding quality. The strength of Transformer-based models lies in their unparalleled ability to capture complex, non-local interactions and contextual dependencies, leading to highly expressive embeddings. They can dynamically adapt their focus to relevant parts of the graph, which is particularly beneficial for heterogeneous and sparse KGs where fixed neighborhood definitions might be suboptimal. However, these models come with significant trade-offs. Transformers are computationally intensive, requiring substantial memory and processing power, especially for very large knowledge graphs. Their parameter count can be high, posing challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments, a problem that \cite{chen2023} attempts to address with entity-agnostic representation learning, though not specifically for Transformers. The assumption that graph structures can be effectively linearized or tokenized for sequential processing, while often effective, might not always perfectly align with the intrinsic non-sequential nature of graphs, potentially leading to information loss or increased complexity in input preparation.

\subsection*{4.3. Automated Search and Meta-Learning for KGE Architectures}

The proliferation of diverse deep learning architectures for KGE, each with its own scoring functions, aggregation mechanisms, and hyperparameters, has introduced a significant challenge: manually designing and tuning these models is a labor-intensive and often suboptimal process. This complexity has spurred the development of **automated search** and **meta-learning** approaches, aiming to discover optimal KGE architectures or components with reduced human intervention. This trend reflects a broader movement in machine learning towards automating model design, often referred to as Neural Architecture Search (NAS).

**Automated Search for Scoring Functions:** A pioneering work in this direction is **AutoSF (Searching Scoring Functions for Knowledge Graph Embedding)** \cite{zhang2019}. AutoSF proposes to automatically discover effective scoring functions for KGE by framing the search as a reinforcement learning problem. A controller (e.g., an RNN) generates candidate scoring functions, which are then evaluated on a KGE task (e.g., link prediction). The performance serves as a reward signal to update the controller, iteratively improving the search process. This approach directly addresses the limitation of manually selecting from a fixed set of scoring functions (e.g., TransE, DistMult, RotatE), which may not be optimal for a given KG. Building on this, \cite{di20210ib} presented an efficient relation-aware scoring function search, further refining the search space and efficiency. The strength of AutoSF-like methods is their ability to explore a vast space of potential scoring functions, potentially discovering novel and highly effective combinations tailored to specific KG characteristics. However, the search process itself can be computationally very expensive, requiring significant resources and time. The generalizability of a scoring function discovered on one KG to another remains an open question, often necessitating a new search.

**Automated Search for GNN Components:** Extending the automated design paradigm to GNNs, **Message Function Search for Knowledge Graph Embedding** \cite{di2023} focuses on automatically discovering optimal message functions within GNN architectures. In GNNs, the message function dictates how information is transformed and aggregated from neighbors. Manually designing these functions is challenging due to the intricate interplay of aggregation, transformation, and activation operations. By automating this search, \cite{di2023} aims to find message functions that are highly effective for KGE tasks, adapting to the specific structural patterns of different KGs. This directly tackles the methodological limitation of fixed GNN architectures, which may not be universally optimal. Other related works, such as \cite{zhang2020i7j}, explored searching for recurrent architectures for KGE, demonstrating the versatility of NAS in this domain.

**Meta-Learning for Adaptability:** Meta-learning, or "learning to learn," provides a framework for models to quickly adapt to new tasks or unseen entities/relations, which is crucial for inductive KGE and dynamic KGs. **Meta-Knowledge Transfer for Inductive Knowledge Graph Embedding** \cite{chen2021} is a prime example, enabling KGE models to perform well on unseen entities by transferring knowledge learned from known entities. For dynamic KGs, \cite{sun2024} proposed learning dynamic KGE in evolving service ecosystems via meta-learning, allowing models to adapt to temporal changes without extensive retraining. Similarly, \cite{mao2024v2s} explored dynamic graph embedding via meta-learning. The core assumption here is that there are underlying meta-patterns or meta-parameters that can be learned across tasks, enabling rapid adaptation.
*   **Strengths:** Automated design and meta-learning significantly reduce manual effort in model design and hyperparameter tuning, leading to potentially superior and highly customized architectures. They enhance the adaptability of KGE models to diverse and evolving knowledge graphs, improving inductive capabilities and performance on cold-start scenarios.
*   **Weaknesses:** The primary limitation is the substantial computational cost associated with the search process, which can be prohibitive for very large search spaces or KGs. The interpretability of automatically discovered architectures can also be low, making it difficult to understand *why* certain components or functions perform well. Furthermore, the effectiveness of meta-learning often depends on the similarity between the meta-training tasks and the target tasks; significant domain shifts can reduce its benefits. The theoretical guarantees for the optimality or convergence of these search processes are often limited, relying heavily on empirical validation. Despite these challenges, automated design and meta-learning represent a powerful frontier for pushing the boundaries of KGE expressiveness and adaptability, promising more intelligent and autonomous KGE systems in the future.
