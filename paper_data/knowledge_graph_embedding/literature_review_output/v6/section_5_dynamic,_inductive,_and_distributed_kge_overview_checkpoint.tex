\section{Dynamic, Inductive, and Distributed KGE}
\label{sec:dynamic_inductive_and_distributed_kge}

The preceding section, "Enriching KGE: Auxiliary Information, Rules, and Multi-modality," demonstrated how integrating diverse external information and explicit logical constraints can significantly enhance the expressiveness and reasoning capabilities of Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs). However, these advancements largely operated under the implicit assumption of a centralized, static, or quasi-static knowledge graph. In stark contrast, real-world knowledge graphs are inherently dynamic, constantly evolving with new facts, entities, and relations, often distributed across various data sources, and requiring continuous updates. This dynamic nature introduces critical challenges that necessitate a fundamental shift in KGE model design.

This section, "Dynamic, Inductive, and Distributed KGE," addresses these pivotal challenges, moving beyond static and centralized assumptions to explore how KGE models can be made adaptable, scalable, and secure in complex, operational environments. We delve into three interconnected areas. Firstly, we examine \textit{Temporal Knowledge Graph Embedding (TKGE)}, which focuses on modeling the temporal dynamics of facts and entities, capturing their evolution and validity over time \cite{community_1, community_4}. Secondly, we explore \textit{Inductive and Continual KGE}, tackling the crucial problem of learning embeddings for unseen entities and relations (inductive learning) and efficiently updating models with new information without full retraining (continual learning), thereby enabling KGEs to adapt to the ever-growing nature of knowledge bases \cite{community_1, 8f096071a09701012c9c279aee2a88143a295935}. Finally, we investigate \textit{Federated and Privacy-Preserving KGE}, addressing the complexities of collaborative learning across distributed and privacy-sensitive data sources, ensuring secure and efficient knowledge sharing in decentralized settings \cite{community_1, 8c93f3cecf79bd9f8d021f589d095305e281dd2f}. The overarching goal is to equip KGE models with the necessary mechanisms to thrive in the fluid, decentralized, and privacy-conscious landscape of modern knowledge management systems.
