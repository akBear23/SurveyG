    "summary": "1.  <think>\nI will cluster the provided papers into three distinct subgroups based on their primary focus:\n1.  **Foundational KGE Model Development & Expressiveness**: This cluster will include papers that introduce novel knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models or significantly enhance existing ones to better capture the inherent structure, semantics, and diverse relational patterns within knowledge graphs. Their core contribution is to the KGE methodology itself, aiming for improved accuracy, efficiency, and representational power.\n2.  **KGE for Downstream Applications**: This cluster will comprise papers that leverage KGE techniques as a fundamental component to address specific real-world problems or applications beyond simple link prediction. These papers demonstrate the utility of learned embeddings in practical scenarios, often requiring task-specific frameworks or adaptations around the core KGE models.\n3.  **Extending KGE & Meta-Analysis**: This cluster will group papers that either extend the core KGE paradigm by incorporating additional dimensions (like time) or provide a high-level overview, comparative analysis, and critical assessment of the KGE field itself. These contributions broaden the applicability of KGE or deepen our understanding of its landscape and limitations.\n\n**Paper assignments based on this strategy:**\n\n*   **Foundational KGE Model Development & Expressiveness:**\n    *   [wang2014] Knowledge Graph Embedding by Translating on Hyperplanes (TransH) - Focuses on improving translation-based models for complex relations.\n    *   [ji2015] Knowledge Graph Embedding via Dynamic Mapping Matrix (TransD) - Further refines translation models for entity/relation diversity and efficiency.\n    *   [sun2018] RotatE: Knowledge Graph Embedding by Relational Rotation in Complex Space - Introduces a new geometric paradigm (rotation) to capture diverse relational patterns simultaneously.\n\n*   **KGE for Downstream Applications:**\n    *   [sun2018] Bootstrapping Entity Alignment with Knowledge Graph Embedding (BootEA) - Applies KGE to entity alignment, with a focus on low-resource settings.\n    *   [zhang2019] Multi-view Knowledge Graph Embedding for Entity Alignment (MultiKE) - Applies KGE to entity alignment, integrating multiple feature views.\n    *   [huang2019] Knowledge Graph Embedding Based Question Answering (KEQA) - Applies KGE to question answering over KGs.\n    *   [sun2018] Recurrent knowledge graph embedding for effective recommendation (RKGE) - Applies KGE to recommendation systems, learning path semantics.\n\n*   **Extending KGE & Meta-Analysis:**\n    *   [dasgupta2018] HyTE: Hyperplane-based Temporally aware Knowledge Graph Embedding - Extends KGE to incorporate temporal information.\n    *   [rossi2020] Knowledge Graph Embedding for Link Prediction (Survey) - Provides a comprehensive survey and critical analysis of KGE for link prediction.\n\nThis clustering effectively separates papers focused on *how* to embed (foundational models), *what* to do with embeddings (applications), and *how to broaden or understand* the embedding space (extensions/surveys).",
