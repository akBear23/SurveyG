INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Knowledge graph embedding aims at representing entities and relations in a knowledge graph as dense, low-dimensional and real-valued vectors. It can efficiently measure semantic correlations of entities and relations in knowledge graphs, and improve the performance of knowledge acquisition, fusion and inference. Among various embedding models appeared in recent years, the translation-based models such as TransE, TransH, TransR and TranSparse achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, the translation principle applied in these models is too strict and can not deal with complex entities and relations very well. In this paper, by introducing parameter vectors into the translation principle which treats each relation as a translation from the head entity to the tail entity, we propose a novel dynamic translation principle which supports flexible translation between the embeddings of entities and relations. We use this principle to improve the TransE, TransR and TranSparse models respectively and build new models named TransE-DT, TransR-DT and TranSparse-DT correspondingly. Experimental results show that our dynamic translation principle achieves great improvement in both the link prediction task and the triple classification task.

Knowledge graph embedding aims at representing entities and relations in a knowledge graph as dense, low-dimensional and real-valued vectors. It can efficiently measure semantic correlations of entities and relations in knowledge graphs, and improve the performance of knowledge acquisition, fusion and inference. Among various embedding models appeared in recent years, the translation-based models such as TransE, TransH, TransR and TranSparse achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, the translation principle applied in these models is too strict and can not deal with complex entities and relations very well. In this paper, by introducing parameter vectors into the translation principle which treats each relation as a translation from the head entity to the tail entity, we propose a novel dynamic translation principle which supports flexible translation between the embeddings of entities and relations. We use this principle to improve the TransE, TransR and TranSparse models respectively and build new models named TransE-DT, TransR-DT and TranSparse-DT correspondingly. Experimental results show that our dynamic translation principle achieves great improvement in both the link prediction task and the triple classification task.
