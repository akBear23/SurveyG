INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Navigating the vast and intricate landscape of chemical knowledge graphs presents a formidable challenge for traditional question answering systems. We introduce a novel Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) system specifically engineered for the complex domain of chemistry, addressing critical needs in research and industrial applications. Our architecture pioneers a hybrid multi-embedding space approach, querying diverse embedding methods in parallel to leverage their distinct strengths.

This system integrates a sophisticated score alignment model for consolidated results, an implicit multihop relation algorithm to navigate deep ontologies, and a BERT-based bidirectional entity-linking model robustly tailored for chemical entities. Further innovations include a joint numerical embedding model for efficient numerical filtering, semantic agents for autonomous calculations, and advanced semantic parsing for intricate chemical reaction mechanisms. Validated on a dedicated chemistry dataset, this modular and robust system significantly advances the state-of-the-art in domain-specific KGQA, promising to revolutionize fact-oriented information retrieval and intelligent knowledge access in scientific and industrial applications.
