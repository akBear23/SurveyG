INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Accurate change detection in high-resolution remote sensing images is paramount for Earth observation, yet it remains profoundly challenging due to pervasive style discrepancies, pseudochange regions, and the complex, multiscale nature of changing objects. Existing methods often falter in robustly handling these issues, leading to imprecise change maps and poor boundary delineation. We introduce the **Fourier feature interaction and multiscale perception (FIMP) model**, a novel deep learning framework designed to overcome these limitations. FIMP innovatively leverages the **Fourier transform** in the frequency domain for adaptive filtering of bitemporal features, effectively mitigating style discrepancies. Furthermore, our proposed **Temporal Change Enhancement Module (TCEM)** aggregates and emphasizes change areas, significantly improving the recognition of diverse multiscale objects. Complementing this, the **U-fusion Change Perception Module (UCPM)** employs multilevel bidirectional feature fusion to precisely delineate complex semantic change boundaries. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate FIMP's superior performance, outperforming seven state-of-the-art methods. This work not only advances the technical state-of-the-art in **remote sensing change detection** but also offers a powerful paradigm for robust feature learning and multiscale perception under challenging imaging conditions.
