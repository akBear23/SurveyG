INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Unlocking the full potential of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) for complex reasoning hinges on accurately modeling diverse relation patterns, particularly the elusive non-commutative composition. Existing KGE models often falter in capturing the sequential order inherent in multi-hop reasoning, limiting their inferential power. We introduce **Rotate3D**, a novel KGE model that redefines how relations are understood. By embedding entities into a three-dimensional (3D) space and defining relations as precise 3D rotations, Rotate3D inherently leverages the non-commutative properties of rotations. This elegant geometric approach naturally preserves the order of relation composition, a critical advancement for robust multi-hop reasoning. Our extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that Rotate3D consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in both link prediction and path query answering. Furthermore, qualitative analyses confirm its superior ability to capture complex relation patterns, especially composition. Rotate3D represents a significant leap forward, offering a powerful paradigm for knowledge graph reasoning and paving the way for more sophisticated AI applications.

### Technical Paper Analysis:

1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**
    *   Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models need to effectively learn low-dimensional representations of entities and relations to support various applications \cite{gao2020}.
    *   A critical challenge is for KGE models to accurately capture and infer diverse relation patterns, including symmetry/antisymmetry, inversion, and especially the non-commutative composition pattern \cite{gao2020}.
    *   Modeling non-commutative composition is crucial for robust multi-hop reasoning within knowledge graphs \cite{gao2020}.

2.  **Related Work & Positioning**
    *   Most existing KGE methods struggle or fail to adequately model the non-commutative composition pattern of relations \cite{gao2020}.
    *   This work positions itself as a solution to this specific limitation, particularly for multi-hop reasoning where relation order matters \cite{gao2020}.

    *   **Core Method**: Rotate3D maps entities into a three-dimensional (3D) space \cite{gao2020}.
    *   **Relation Definition**: Relations are defined as rotations that transform a head entity's embedding to a tail entity's embedding in this 3D space \cite{gao2020}.
    *   **Novelty**: The key innovation lies in leveraging the inherent non-commutative composition property of rotations in 3D space. This allows Rotate3D to naturally preserve the order of relation composition, directly addressing the limitations of previous models \cite{gao2020}.
