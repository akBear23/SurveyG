INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Despite their remarkable success in aligning images and text, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP harbor a critical, often-overlooked flaw: their intra-modal embedding spaces are profoundly misaligned. We unveil this "intra-modal misalignment," demonstrating that direct similarity comparisons within CLIP's image or text features often fail to reflect true semantic relationships, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks like image-to-image or text-to-text retrieval.

To address this, we propose a novel approach: transforming intra-modal tasks into inter-modal ones via data-agnostic modality inversion. We adapt Optimization-based Textual Inversion (OTI) for mapping images to text and introduce Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI) for mapping text to images. Crucially, both methods operate at a single-feature level without requiring external data or trained networks, offering unbiased insights. Our comprehensive empirical study across fifteen datasets reveals that this inter-modal strategy significantly outperforms traditional intra-modal baselines. Furthermore, we show that incorporating intra-modal loss terms during VLM pre-training or reducing the modality gap can effectively mitigate this misalignment. This work redefines how CLIP's embedding space should be leveraged for intra-modal tasks, guiding the design of more robust VLMs and enhancing diverse downstream applications.

### Analysis of "CROSS THE GAP: EXPOSING THE INTRA-MODAL MISALIGNMENT IN CLIP VIA MODALITY INVERSION" \cite{mistretta2025}

1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**
    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the suboptimal performance of pre-trained multi-modal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP when their individual text or image encoders are used for *intra-modal tasks* (e.g., image-to-image or text-to-text retrieval). This suboptimality is termed "intra-modal misalignment."
    *   **Importance and Challenge**: CLIP's inter-modal contrastive loss, which aligns image-text pairs, does not enforce any constraints on *intra-modal* similarities. Consequently, the similarity between two image features or two text features in CLIP's embedding space might not accurately reflect their true semantic similarity. This issue is often overlooked, leading to suboptimal results in many applications that rely on intra-modal CLIP similarities (e.g., KNN-based classification, text-to-image generation, video synthesis). The "modality gap" (separation of image and text features) is a related phenomenon that is preserved and even worsened by CLIP's training.

2.  **Related Work & Positioning**
    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: The work builds upon the understanding of contrastively trained VLMs (e.g., CLIP, SigLIP) and the "modality gap" phenomenon (Liang et al., 2022). It also relates to prior studies that investigated misaligned intra-modal embedding distances in specific contexts like zero- and few-shot image classification (Udandarao et al., 2023; Yi et al., 2024), which proposed leveraging the inter-modal space.
    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Previous works addressing intra-modal issues were often limited in scope, focusing on specific tasks or datasets. They did not comprehensively investigate the fundamental nature of intra-modal versus inter-modal similarities across diverse tasks and datasets. Furthermore, existing modality inversion techniques often rely on external data or the training of additional mapping networks, which can introduce external biases.

3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**
    *   **Core Technical Method**: The central approach is to transform intra-modal tasks into inter-modal ones by leveraging "modality inversion" to exploit CLIP's strong inter-modal alignment. This involves mapping features from their native modality (e.g., image) to the complementary one (e.g., text) before computing similarities.
    *   **Novelty**:
        *   **Optimization-based Textual Inversion (OTI) Adaptation**: The paper adapts OTI (Baldrati et al., 2023) to map image features into text features. Unlike its original use, \cite{mistretta2025} employs OTI purely as a mapping technique, optimizing a set of pseudo-tokens (vectors in the token embedding space) through the *frozen* text encoder to align with a given image feature via a cosine loss, without regularization or auxiliary vocabulary.
        *   **Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI) Introduction**: \cite{mistretta2025} introduces OVI to map text features into the visual embedding space. OVI optimizes a set of pseudo-patches (vectors in the patch embedding space) through the *frozen* ViT-based image encoder to align with a given text feature via a cosine loss. It handles varying patch numbers via nearest-neighbor interpolation.
        *   **Single-Feature Level and Data-Agnostic**: Both OTI and OVI are iterative, optimization-based strategies that operate at the single-feature level. Crucially, they *do not require external data or the training of additional mapping networks*, minimizing external biases in the analysis and making them highly suitable for fundamental investigations of CLIP's embedding space.

4.  **Key Technical Contributions**
    *   A thorough and comprehensive study of CLIP’s intra-modal misalignment, empirically demonstrating that relying on intra-modal similarities computed through pre-trained CLIP encoders is inherently suboptimal \cite{mistretta2025}.
    *   The proposal to transform intra-modal tasks into inter-modal ones via modality inversion to effectively exploit CLIP’s inter-modal alignment \cite{mistretta2025}.
    *   The introduction of Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI), a novel single-feature level modality inversion strategy that maps textual features into the image embedding space without requiring auxiliary data or trained adapters \cite{mistretta2025}.
    *   Empirical evidence demonstrating that incorporating intra-modal loss terms during VLM pre-training (e.g., SLIP) or reducing the modality gap significantly mitigates the impact of intra-modal misalignment \cite{mistretta2025}.

5.  **Experimental Validation**
    *   **Experiments Conducted**:
        *   **Intra-modal Retrieval**: Extensive experiments on image-to-image and text-to-text retrieval tasks across more than fifteen datasets. Performance of direct intra-modal similarity was compared against inter-modal similarity achieved via OTI (for image-to-image) and OVI (for text-to-text).
        *   **Inter-modal Task Validation**: Applied modality inversion to a native inter-modal task (zero-shot image classification) to show that transforming it into an intra-modal comparison *decreases* performance, thereby validating the hypothesis that performance gains in intra-modal tasks stem from leveraging inter-modal alignment.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies**: Investigated the effect of adding intra-modal loss terms during VLM pre-training (using SLIP) and reducing the modality gap (by fine-tuning CLIP as in Liang et al., 2022) on intra-modal misalignment.
    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:
        *   Approaching intra-modal tasks inter-modally (via OTI/OVI) *significantly outperforms* intra-modal baselines on all tested datasets.
        *   Applying modality inversion to the inherently inter-modal zero-shot image classification task *yields worse performance* than the inter-modal baseline.
        *   Incorporating an intra-modal term in the pre-training objective (SLIP) *significantly mitigates* intra-modal misalignment.
        *   Narrowing the modality gap *diminishes the impact* of intra-modal misalignment, indicating a relationship between the two phenomena.

6.  **Limitations & Scope**
    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: OVI is specifically designed for ViT-based image encoders due to its reliance on learning pseudo-patches in the patch embedding space. The optimization-based nature of OTI and OVI implies an iterative process, which might have computational overhead compared to direct feature extraction.
    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The study primarily focuses on CLIP, though the proposed modality inversion techniques (OTI and OVI) are generalizable to other VLMs that map images and texts into a shared embedding space. The findings are most relevant for applications that rely on intra-modal similarity computations using VLM features.

7.  **Technical Significance**
    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art**: \cite{mistretta2025} provides a foundational understanding of intra-modal misalignment in CLIP, a critical issue that has been largely overlooked, and offers a robust methodology to analyze and mitigate it. It challenges the common, often suboptimal, practice of using CLIP encoders individually for intra-modal comparisons.
    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:
        *   **VLM Design**: The findings highlight the importance of incorporating intra-modal constraints during VLM pre-training to achieve better alignment within each modality, guiding the development of more robust multi-modal models.
        *   **Application Development**: It suggests that for intra-modal tasks, researchers should consider inter-modal comparison strategies (e.g., via modality inversion) to achieve superior performance, potentially improving various downstream applications like retrieval, clustering, and consistency checks.
        *   **Modality Gap Research**: The work further elucidates the relationship between the modality gap and intra-modal misalignment, opening avenues for future research into their interplay and joint mitigation.
        *   **Novel Tooling**: The introduced OVI and adapted OTI provide data-agnostic tools for deeper analysis of VLM embedding spaces.
