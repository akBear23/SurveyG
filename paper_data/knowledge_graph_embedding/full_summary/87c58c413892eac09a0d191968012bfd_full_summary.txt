INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The pervasive challenge of data scarcity and the prohibitive cost of annotation critically impede AI scalability and deployment in many domains. This paper introduces a novel **self-supervised learning (SSL)** framework designed to overcome this bottleneck, achieving high performance with significantly less labeled data than traditional methods. Our approach uniquely integrates **contrastive learning** with innovative **multi-spectral augmentations**, including **spectral jittering** and **band shuffling**, specifically tailored for complex multi-spectral imagery. A key innovation is our **variance-aware spatial-spectral masked autoencoding**, which applies masking based on local variance within spectral bands, effectively capturing intricate spatial and spectral characteristics.

Evaluated on the **EuroSAT land cover classification** dataset, our framework achieved an impressive 81.2% accuracy using only 10% of the labeled data. This performance not only surpassed supervised learning by 2.7% but also outperformed semi-supervised methods by 2.1% under the same **data scarcity**. This work demonstrates the transformative potential of combining diverse SSL paradigms with domain-specific augmentations, paving the way for more scalable, accessible, and cost-effective AI solutions in **remote sensing**, medical imaging, and other data-intensive fields. By drastically reducing annotation burdens, our method advances the state-of-the-art in data-efficient AI.
