INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The inherent expressiveness of knowledge graph (KG) embeddings is profoundly shaped by their underlying geometric space, a critical factor often overlooked by current methodologies. We expose how the pervasive reliance on the Minkowski metric fundamentally limits model performance, necessitating a paradigm shift in metric design. This paper introduces the novel **Cycle metric**, a groundbreaking distance metric inspired by the oscillation properties of periodic functions, specifically engineered to unlock superior KG embedding expressiveness. Our quantitative analysis reveals the significant influence of function period on embedding space capabilities, demonstrating that smaller periods dramatically enhance model performance. Integrating this innovation, we propose **CyclE**, a new model that seamlessly combines the Cycle metric with established KG embedding architectures. Extensive experiments rigorously validate that the Cycle metric is demonstrably more appropriate and effective than Minkowski for diverse KG embedding tasks, yielding superior results. This work not only advances the state-of-the-art by offering a theoretically robust and empirically validated alternative but also paves the way for designing highly expressive and context-aware embedding spaces.

FULL SUMMARY:
==================================================
Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:

1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**
    *   Existing knowledge graph (KG) embedding methods, while aiming to encode entities and relations into low-dimensional vector spaces, fail to adequately consider the influence of the embedding space itself \cite{yang2021}.
    *   This oversight leads to unsatisfactory performance in practical applications, highlighting the need for improved expressiveness in KG embeddings \cite{yang2021}.

2.  **Related Work & Positioning**
    *   The work positions itself by identifying a critical limitation in existing KG embedding approaches: their inability to properly account for the characteristics and influence of the embedding space \cite{yang2021}.
    *   Specifically, it points out the implications and limitations of the widely used Minkowski metric in current KG embedding models \cite{yang2021}.

3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**
    *   The core technical method involves improving the expressiveness of the embedding space by introducing a novel metric \cite{yang2021}.
    *   The paper first quantitatively analyzes the implications of the Minkowski metric \cite{yang2021}.
    *   It then proposes a new metric, named **Cycle metric**, which is based on the oscillation property of periodic functions \cite{yang2021}.
    *   The approach also investigates the significant influence of the function period on embedding space expressiveness, finding that a smaller period leads to better expressive ability for a trained model \cite{yang2021}.
    *   Finally, a new model, **CyclE**, is proposed, which integrates the Cycle Metric with popular existing KG embedding models \cite{yang2021}.

4.  **Key Technical Contributions**
    *   **Novel Metric**: Introduction of the "Cycle metric," a new distance metric for KG embeddings derived from the oscillation property of periodic functions \cite{yang2021}.
    *   **Theoretical Insight**: Quantitative analysis of the Minkowski metric's implications and the discovery that the function period significantly impacts embedding space expressiveness, with smaller periods yielding better results \cite{yang2021}.
    *   **System Design**: Proposal of the "CyclE" model, which effectively combines the novel Cycle Metric with established KG embedding architectures \cite{yang2021}.

5.  **Experimental Validation**
    *   Comprehensive experimental results were conducted to validate the findings \cite{yang2021}.
    *   The key performance metric and comparison result indicate that the Cycle metric is "more appropriate than Minkowski for KG embedding" \cite{yang2021}.

6.  **Limitations & Scope**
    *   The paper focuses on improving embedding space expressiveness through metric design, specifically addressing the limitations of the Minkowski metric \cite{yang2021}.
    *   The scope of applicability is within knowledge graph embedding tasks, particularly those benefiting from enhanced metric properties \cite{yang2021}.

7.  **Technical Significance**
    *   This work advances the technical state-of-the-art by demonstrating that the choice of metric significantly influences the expressiveness of KG embedding spaces \cite{yang2021}.
    *   It provides a novel metric (Cycle metric) and a corresponding model (CyclE) that outperform traditional approaches relying on Minkowski metrics \cite{yang2021}.
    *   The findings regarding the influence of function period on expressiveness could inspire future research into designing more sophisticated and context-aware embedding spaces for knowledge graphs \cite{yang2021}.
