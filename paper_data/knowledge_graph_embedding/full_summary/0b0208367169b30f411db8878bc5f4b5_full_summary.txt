INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Keloids, characterized by their relentless and excessive fibrosis, present a persistent clinical challenge due to poorly understood underlying mechanisms. To unravel this complex cellular landscape, we employed an integrated multi-omics approach, combining single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with spatial transcriptomics and flow cytometry, to meticulously profile keloid and normal skin tissues. Our study reveals a profound cellular heterogeneity, identifying distinct fibroblast subpopulations with opposing roles in pathogenesis. We pinpointed POSTN-positive mesenchymal fibroblasts (POSTN+ fibs) as highly prevalent in keloids, exhibiting elevated TGF-β signaling and robust pro-fibrotic activity. Conversely, IGFBP2-positive fibroblasts (IGFBP2+ fibs), abundant in normal skin, demonstrated significant anti-fibrotic potential and insensitivity to TGF-β/Periostin signaling. Intriguingly, we also characterized a novel endothelial cell subpopulation (EC10) in keloids, displaying mesenchymal activation characteristics that likely drive abnormal angiogenesis and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT). Spatial transcriptomics and flow cytometry further validated these differential contributions to extracellular matrix (ECM) secretion. These comprehensive insights into keloid pathogenesis provide a crucial theoretical framework, paving the way for the development of targeted, innovative anti-fibrotic therapies.

FULL SUMMARY:
==================================================
Here is a focused summary of the empirical study for literature review:

1.  **Research Questions & Hypotheses**
    This study investigates the cellular heterogeneity and molecular mechanisms underlying keloids \cite{zhao2025}. It implicitly hypothesizes that specific fibroblast subpopulations and endothelial cells contribute to keloid pathogenesis through distinct molecular pathways, such as excessive fibrosis and abnormal angiogenesis.

2.  **Study Design & Methodology**
    This is an observational study employing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile gene expression at a single-cell level \cite{zhao2025}. It further integrates spatial transcriptomics and flow cytometry for validation and detailed characterization of identified cell populations.

3.  **Data & Participants**
    The study utilized three keloid tissues and three normal skin samples \cite{zhao2025}. The data primarily consists of single-cell gene expression profiles, complemented by spatial gene expression data.

4.  **Key Empirical Findings**
    *   Multiple fibroblast subpopulations were identified, with POSTN-positive mesenchymal fibroblasts (POSTN+ mesenchymal fibs) being more prevalent in keloids and exhibiting higher TGF-β signaling activity \cite{zhao2025}.
    *   IGFBP2-positive fibroblasts (IGFBP2+ fibs) were more abundant in normal skin, insensitive to TGF-β/Periostin signaling, and possessed anti-fibrotic potential \cite{zhao2025}.
    *   An endothelial cell subpopulation (EC10) exhibiting mesenchymal activation characteristics was found, potentially promoting abnormal angiogenesis and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition \cite{zhao2025}.
    *   Spatial transcriptomics showed an increase in IGFBP2+ fibroblasts in acne keloidalis after hormonal treatment, and flow cytometry confirmed opposing roles of these two fibroblast subpopulations in ECM secretion \cite{zhao2025}.

5.  **Statistical Analysis**
    The study applied enrichment analysis, cell-cell communication analysis, and trajectory analysis to interpret the complex scRNA-seq data \cite{zhao2025}. Specific significance levels or confidence intervals for these analyses are not explicitly reported in the provided text.

6.  **Validity & Limitations**
    A primary limitation is the small sample size (n=3 for each tissue type), which may limit the generalizability of the findings \cite{zhao2025}. While internal validity appears strong for the observed samples, external validity might be constrained.

7.  **Empirical Contribution**
    This study provides novel empirical insights into keloid pathogenesis by identifying key fibroblast and endothelial cell subpopulations and their molecular roles \cite{zhao2025}. These findings lay a theoretical foundation for developing innovative anti-fibrotic treatment strategies.
