INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Dynamic service ecosystems demand Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) methods capable of efficiently updating incremental knowledge, a critical challenge that conventional approaches struggle to address, hindering the adaptability of intelligent web applications. Existing meta-learning KGE solutions, often limited to local entity information, suffer from spatial deformation and inadequate representation of unseen entities. We introduce MetaHG, a novel meta-learning strategy designed for continuous KGE updates. MetaHG uniquely integrates *both local and potential global structural information* from current knowledge graph snapshots. It initializes entity embeddings using 'in' and 'out' relationship matrices, then refines them through an innovative *hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework* combining a standard GNN layer for local context and a Hypergraph Neural Network (HGNN) layer for capturing global insights. This meta-learning approach facilitates robust meta-knowledge transfer, enabling accurate and timely representation of emerging entities. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate MetaHG's superior performance in dynamically updating service knowledge and generating high-quality embeddings. MetaHG significantly advances the state-of-the-art in KGE, offering a powerful and adaptable solution for intelligent systems operating in rapidly evolving knowledge environments.
