INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The rapid ascent of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demands a profound understanding of their reliability, a challenge fundamentally rooted in *misalignment*. This survey offers a novel, explainability-driven lens to comprehensively dissect alignment and misalignment phenomena in LVLMs, moving beyond conventional hallucination-centric views. We establish a structured framework, categorizing misalignment across semantic levels (object, attribute, relational) and tracing its root causes from data to inference. Crucially, we differentiate misalignment as a foundational concept broader than hallucination, revealing its multi-level origins. Our analysis explores the theoretical underpinnings of vision-language alignment and the critical interplay between representational and behavioral alignment, demonstrating how strong internal correspondence underpins accurate responses. By reviewing diverse mitigation strategies and identifying key research gaps, including the urgent need for standardized evaluation and deeper explainability studies, this work significantly enhances the field's understanding of LVLM robustness. It provides an essential roadmap for developing more reliable and trustworthy next-generation LVLMs.

FULL SUMMARY:
==================================================
Here is a focused summary of the survey paper for literature review:

1.  **Review Scope & Objectives**
    *   This survey comprehensively examines alignment and misalignment in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) through an explainability lens.
    *   Its main objectives are to define alignment, analyze misalignment phenomena across semantic levels, identify their root causes, review mitigation strategies, and outline future research directions.

2.  **Literature Coverage**
    *   The survey covers recent advancements in LVLMs, including prominent models and foundational concepts, providing a structured framework for understanding these complex systems.
    *   It offers a comprehensive review of existing mitigation strategies, categorizing them based on their underlying motivations and trade-offs.

3.  **Classification Framework**
    *   The survey organizes alignment into two fundamental aspects: representational alignment (internal embedding space correspondence) and behavioral alignment (accurate, factual, and consistent textual responses).
    *   Misalignment phenomena are categorized at three semantic levels: object misalignment, attribute misalignment, and relational misalignment.
    *   The causes of misalignment are analyzed across three fundamental levels: data level, model level, and inference level.
    *   Mitigation strategies are classified into parameter-tuning alignment methods and parameter-frozen alignment methods.

4.  **Key Findings & Insights**
    *   Misalignment is a broader and more foundational concept than hallucination, with hallucination being a potential consequence of misalignment \cite{shu2025}.
    *   Misalignment emerges from challenges at multiple levels, including data imperfections, ability gaps, pretrain-finetuning knowledge gaps, knowledge conflicts at the model level, and task discrepancy at the inference level \cite{shu2025}.
    *   The possibility of alignment between vision and language modalities is rooted in both theoretical (Platonic Representation Hypothesis) and algorithmic (inherent semantic similarities, staged training) perspectives \cite{shu2025}.
    *   Strong representational alignment typically supports better behavioral alignment, highlighting their inherent connection \cite{shu2025}.

5.  **Research Gaps & Future Directions**
    *   The survey identifies a critical need for standardized evaluation protocols to consistently measure and compare alignment in LVLMs.
    *   It emphasizes the importance of in-depth explainability studies to further understand *what* alignment is, *how* it is achieved, and *why* it is possible \cite{shu2025}.

6.  **Survey Contribution**
    *   This survey provides a unique, explainability-driven perspective on LVLM alignment and misalignment, distinguishing it from existing surveys focused primarily on hallucination.
    *   It offers a comprehensive and structured framework for understanding, analyzing, and mitigating alignment challenges, enhancing the field's understanding of LVLM reliability and trustworthiness \cite{shu2025}.
