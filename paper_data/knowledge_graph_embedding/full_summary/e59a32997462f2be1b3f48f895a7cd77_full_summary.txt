INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Knowledge graphs (KGs) have been widely applied in many fields such as recommendation systems and knowledge reasoning. Embedding KGs into a continuous vector space has quickly gained significant attention. However, most traditional KG embedding models assume that all the facts in the existing KGs are completely correct, ignoring that KG construction usually involves automatic mechanisms. These automatic construction processes inevitably generate a lot of noises and conflicts, including low-quality errors (e.g., entity type errors). Moreover, these low-quality noises could greatly influence the quality of rule extraction, which may reduce the efficiency of Rule-Guided Embedding model (RUGE). To address this problem, an efficient method to eliminate those entity type errors in triples is proposed and applied to RUGE. Experimental results demonstrate that the filtering of low-quality noises can greatly improve the accuracy of knowledge representation learning as well as the quality of rules, further illustrating the effectiveness of our method.
