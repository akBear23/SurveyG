INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Unlocking the full potential of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) hinges on overcoming data sparsity, a challenge effectively addressed by **Knowledge Graph embedding**. This comprehensive survey systematically reviews the **state-of-the-art** in KG embedding, a pivotal technique for mapping entities and relations into a **low-dimensional feature space**. We present a novel classification framework, distinguishing between models leveraging only observed triplets and advanced approaches that harness additional **semantic information**, including **textual descriptions** and **relation paths**. Our analysis critically compares the advantages and disadvantages of diverse methods, providing empirical insights into their performance and demonstrating how KG embedding significantly benefits downstream tasks such as **question answering** and **recommender systems**. Furthermore, this paper identifies crucial research gaps and outlines specific future directions, guiding researchers toward advancing techniques and expanding application trends. This survey offers an invaluable resource for navigating the complex landscape of KG embedding, fostering innovation in this rapidly evolving field.
