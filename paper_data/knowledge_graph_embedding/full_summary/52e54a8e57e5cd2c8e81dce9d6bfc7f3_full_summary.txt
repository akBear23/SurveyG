INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The orchestration of cloud computing infrastructures is challenging, considering the number, heterogeneity and dynamicity of the involved resources, along with the highly distributed nature of the applications that use them for computation and storage. Evidently, the volume of relevant monitoring data can be significant, and the ability to collect, analyze, and act on this data in real time is critical for the infrastructure’s efficient use. In this study, we introduce a novel methodology that adeptly manages the diverse, dynamic, and voluminous nature of cloud resources and the applications that they support. We use knowledge graphs to represent computing and storage resources and illustrate the relationships between them and the applications that utilize them. We then train GraphSAGE to acquire vector-based representations of the infrastructures’ properties, while preserving the structural properties of the graph. These are efficiently provided as input to two unsupervised machine learning algorithms, namely CBLOF and Isolation Forest, for the detection of storage and computing overusage events, where CBLOF demonstrates better performance across all our evaluation metrics. Following the detection of such events, we have also developed appropriate re-optimization mechanisms that ensure the performance of the served applications. Evaluated in a simulated environment, our methods demonstrate a significant advancement in anomaly detection and infrastructure optimization. The results underscore the potential of this closed-loop operation in dynamically adapting to the evolving demands of cloud infrastructures. By integrating data representation and machine learning methods with proactive management strategies, this research contributes substantially to the field of cloud computing, offering a scalable, intelligent solution for modern cloud infrastructures.
