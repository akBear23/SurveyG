INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Unlocking the full potential of Knowledge Graphs hinges on robust embedding techniques that capture intricate relational semantics. This survey delves into the foundational landscape of **Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE)**, offering a critical and comparative analysis of three cornerstone translational models: **TransE, TransH, and TransR**. Far beyond a mere overview, we meticulously dissect the core concepts, methodologies, and underlying principles that define each approach, revealing their distinct strengths and inherent limitations in representing complex relational data.

By synthesizing a wealth of existing research, including diverse applications and experimental outcomes, this paper provides an unparalleled feature-by-feature comparison. Researchers gain profound insights into how these models navigate challenges like multi-relational data and hierarchical structures, guiding informed selection for specific tasks. This comprehensive resource serves as an indispensable guide for understanding the evolution and practical implications of these prominent **KGE** methods, empowering future advancements in **relational learning** and **semantic representation**.
