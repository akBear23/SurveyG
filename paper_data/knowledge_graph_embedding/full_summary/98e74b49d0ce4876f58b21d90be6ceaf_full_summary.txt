INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Unlocking the profound potential of interconnected data, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a cornerstone of modern deep learning. Yet, navigating their diverse architectures and applications remains a significant challenge. This comprehensive survey provides an indispensable guide, meticulously dissecting the GNN landscape. We present a novel classification framework that systematically explores how graph structures are formed, critically examines prominent GNN models—including Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), GraphSAGE, and Graph Attention Networks (GATs)—and elucidates their underlying *message-passing mechanisms*. Through a rigorous comparative analysis, we unveil the strengths and limitations of these models across a spectrum of *diverse applications*, demonstrating how unique requirements necessitate tailored GNN approaches. Beyond theoretical insights, this work synthesizes crucial information on *commonly used datasets* and *supporting Python libraries*, offering a practical roadmap for researchers and practitioners. This survey is an essential resource for understanding the current state and future trajectory of *deep learning on graph data*, empowering informed model selection and innovation in this rapidly evolving field.
