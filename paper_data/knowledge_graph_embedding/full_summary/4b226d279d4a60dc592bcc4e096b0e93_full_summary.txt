INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Prospectivity mapping based on deep learning typically requires substantial amounts of geological feature information from known mineral deposits. Due to the limited spatial distribution of ore deposits, the training of predictive models is often hampered by insufficient positive samples. Meanwhile, data-driven mineral prospectivity mapping often overlooks domain knowledge and expert experience, leading to poor interpretability of predictive results. To address this problem, we employed the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for spatial feature classification to expand the number of positive samples. The approach integrated the embedding of geological map knowledge graphs with geological exploration data to enhance the knowledge constraints of the prospecting model, which enabled the integration of knowledge with data. Considering the complex spatial structure of geological elements, a bi-branch utilizing the 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN1D) and graph convolutional network (GCN) was used to extract geological spatial features for model training and prediction. To validate the effectiveness of the method, a gold mineralization prediction study was conducted in the Wulonggou area (Qinghai province, western China). The results indicate that, when the number of GMM spatial feature classifications was 17, the positive-to-negative sample ratio was optimal, and the embedding of the knowledge graph controlled the prediction area distribution effectively, which demonstrated strong consistency between the prospecting area and the known mineral deposits. Compared with the predictions by CNN1D, the fused prediction model of CNN1D and GCN yielded higher accuracy. Our model identified 11 classes of mineralization potential areas and provides geological interpretations for different prediction categories.
