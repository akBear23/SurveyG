INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The efficacy of Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) hinges critically on effective training, a process profoundly challenged by the inherent positive-only nature of knowledge graphs. This survey paper delves into the indispensable role of **negative sampling**, a cornerstone technique for training conventional KGE methods, particularly **translational distance-based models**. We present the first comprehensive review and a novel, structured categorization of current negative sampling approaches, classifying them into **static distribution-based**, **dynamic distribution-based**, and **custom cluster-based** methodologies.

Our analysis reveals how the quality of generated negative samples directly dictates the performance of learned knowledge representations in vital downstream tasks such as **link prediction** and **recommendation**. Beyond a systematic overview of prevalent techniques and their characteristics, this paper meticulously identifies key research gaps and offers actionable guidelines to stimulate innovative 'new thoughts' in negative sampling. This work provides a crucial roadmap for researchers to develop more effective and sophisticated negative sampling strategies, ultimately advancing the robustness and applicability of KGEs across diverse applications.

FULL SUMMARY:
==================================================
Here is a focused summary of the survey paper for literature review:

1.  **Review Scope & Objectives**
    This survey paper focuses on negative sampling approaches within the domain of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE). Its main objectives are to summarize current negative sampling methodologies, discuss their characteristics, and offer guidelines for future research in this area.

2.  **Literature Coverage**
    The survey reviews "current negative sampling approaches" and discusses "the most prevalent existing approaches." While it does not specify a particular time period or explicit selection criteria, it aims to cover the significant methods currently in use.

3.  **Classification Framework**
    *   Static distribution-based approaches
    *   Dynamic distribution-based approaches
    *   Custom cluster-based approaches

4.  **Key Findings & Insights**
    *   Negative sampling is crucial for training conventional KGE methods, especially translational distance-based models, due to KGs primarily storing positive samples \cite{qian2021}.
    *   The quality of generated negative samples directly impacts the performance of learned knowledge representations in various downstream tasks, such as recommendation and link prediction \cite{qian2021}.
    *   The survey discusses the characteristics of prevalent negative sampling approaches based on its proposed categorization \cite{qian2021}.

5.  **Research Gaps & Future Directions**
    The survey implicitly identifies a need for further innovation in negative sampling by aiming to provide guidelines for "new thoughts" about these methods in KGE \cite{qian2021}. This suggests future research should explore novel approaches beyond the current categories.

6.  **Survey Contribution**
    This survey provides a structured categorization of current negative sampling approaches in KGE, offering a clear overview of the field. It aims to stimulate new research by providing guidelines for developing more effective negative sampling strategies \cite{qian2021}.
