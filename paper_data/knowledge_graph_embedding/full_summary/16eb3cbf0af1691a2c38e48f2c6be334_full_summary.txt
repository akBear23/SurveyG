INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The advent of Web 3.0 heralds a paradigm shift, promising to revolutionize how we access and interact with information. This survey delves into the transformative potential of the **semantic web** within the **educational domain**, exploring its capacity to forge more flexible, personalized, and profoundly effective **learning experiences**. By making digital content truly meaningful, semantic technologies offer unprecedented opportunities for **adaptive learning** and enhanced knowledge acquisition.

However, realizing this vision is not without significant hurdles. This paper meticulously identifies and analyzes critical barriers to widespread adoption, including pressing **security concerns**, substantial implementation **costs**, the imperative for robust **standardization**, and complex **pedagogical integration** challenges. We present a comprehensive overview of the current landscape, highlighting both the immense promise and the formidable obstacles. This work serves as a vital resource for researchers and practitioners, charting future directions to overcome these limitations and unlock the full potential of semantic web in shaping the next generation of education.
