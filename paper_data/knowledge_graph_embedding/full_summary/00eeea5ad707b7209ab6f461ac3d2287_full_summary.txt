INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Unraveling the intricate web of biological knowledge presents a formidable challenge, often hampered by the scalability limitations of traditional graph exploration methods. This survey illuminates the transformative potential of **Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models** as a powerful paradigm for representing and analyzing complex **biological knowledge graphs**. We demonstrate why KGEs are a natural fit, offering superior performance, accuracy, and unprecedented scalability by learning efficient **low-rank vector representations** of biological entities and relations.

Through a comprehensive review, we showcase KGE models' remarkable predictive and analytical capabilities across critical biological applications, including precise **drug-target interaction prediction** and crucial **polypharmacy side effect prediction**. Beyond highlighting their successes, this paper provides a unique, focused analysis of the practical considerations, opportunities, and inherent challenges in adopting KGEs for biological system modeling. By bridging the gap between advanced computational methods and complex biological data, this work serves as an indispensable resource, guiding researchers toward leveraging KGEs for more effective and scalable discovery in the life sciences.
