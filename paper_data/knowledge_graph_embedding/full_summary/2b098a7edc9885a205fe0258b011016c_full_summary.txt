INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) marks a pivotal paradigm shift in Computational Social Science (CSS), unleashing unprecedented capabilities for understanding complex social phenomena. This comprehensive survey meticulously maps the transformative potential of LLMs, from revolutionizing social media data analysis to enabling nuanced content generation. We delve into their advanced linguistic and contextual understanding, showcasing their application across utterance, discourse, and document levels for critical tasks like sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, and misinformation mitigation. Unlike traditional methods, LLMs offer human-like text comprehension at scale, with evolving multimodal capabilities further expanding their reach. However, their integration into CSS is not without challenges; we critically examine the ethical, technical, legal, data bias, and privacy considerations essential for responsible adoption. By synthesizing traditional computational methods with cutting-edge LLM advancements, this paper provides an authoritative framework, identifying crucial research gaps and charting future directions to harness LLMs' full potential in deepening our understanding of the digital social landscape.
