INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Existing machine learning approaches for gate-level circuit design are fundamentally limited by their inability to capture crucial logic functionality, relying instead on mere structural topology. This oversight severely restricts their applicability in critical areas like logic synthesis, physical design, and verification. We introduce FGNN2, a novel framework that revolutionizes circuit representation learning by extracting generic functionality knowledge through a sophisticated contrastive learning scheme.

FGNN2 employs a customized circuit augmentation strategy to build a robust pretraining dataset and a unique contrastive loss function designed to capture relative functional distance while ensuring input-order invariance. Coupled with a specialized Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture tailored for this paradigm, FGNN2 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on complex real-world circuits. This breakthrough demonstrates unparalleled effectiveness in encoding functional semantics, providing semantically rich and functionally-aware circuit representations that are poised to unlock new frontiers for machine learning in electronic design automation.
