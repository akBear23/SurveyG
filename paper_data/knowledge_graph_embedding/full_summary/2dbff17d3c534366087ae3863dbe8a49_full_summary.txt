INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The scarcity of labeled traffic data critically impedes the development of high-performing learning-based traffic analysis models, a challenge exacerbated by the deep domain knowledge required for manual annotation. While pre-training has revolutionized other domains, its application in traffic analysis remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces **TrafficFormer**, a novel and efficient end-to-end pre-training model specifically designed to overcome this data bottleneck. TrafficFormer employs a two-stage approach: a pre-training phase featuring a novel fine-grained multi-classification task that significantly enhances data representation, and a fine-tuning phase leveraging a unique traffic data augmentation method based on random field initialization to guide model focus. Our extensive experiments demonstrate TrafficFormer's superior capabilities, achieving up to a 10% F1 score improvement across six traffic classification datasets and exhibiting significantly better protocol understanding compared to existing pre-training models. TrafficFormer marks a significant advancement in data-efficient learning for traffic analysis, paving the way for more robust systems in network security, traffic management, and anomaly detection.
