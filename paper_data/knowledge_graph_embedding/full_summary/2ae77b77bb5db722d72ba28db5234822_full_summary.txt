INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The relentless expansion of 5G/6G, IoT, and cloud-based systems demands unprecedented levels of network intelligence, adaptability, and security. This comprehensive survey by \cite{elhajj2025} meticulously explores the transformative power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in revolutionizing communication networks. Through detailed case studies, we illuminate AI's profound effectiveness across critical applications, including advanced traffic prediction, dynamic load balancing, real-time intrusion detection, and sophisticated self-organizing network (SON) capabilities. Our analysis demonstrates how AI is instrumental in creating highly adaptive, robustly secure, and exceptionally efficient network infrastructures, addressing both current complexities and future demands. We highlight AI's proven impact on bandwidth management in high-density urban environments and its crucial role in enhancing security for IoT devices and cloud communications. Furthermore, this review identifies pivotal research gaps and future directions, emphasizing AI-driven network resilience, refined predictive modeling, and the ethical considerations paramount for intelligent network deployment. This paper serves as an essential guide for researchers navigating the evolving landscape of AI-powered communication networks.
