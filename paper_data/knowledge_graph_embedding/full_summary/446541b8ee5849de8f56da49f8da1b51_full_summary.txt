INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Industrial quality control for steel plate manufacturing faces a critical bottleneck: accurately detecting rare surface defects amidst overwhelmingly defect-free samples. Traditional supervised methods falter due to severe data imbalance and the prohibitive cost of acquiring precisely labeled datasets. This paper introduces a groundbreaking unsupervised learning framework for smart steel diagnosis, circumventing the need for explicit human labels.

Our novel approach integrates the joint optimization of a feature extraction network with mini-batch K-means clustering. This synergy dynamically generates robust pseudo-label information from current images, which is then refined through a multi-view transformation strategy. The network self-optimizes feature distinction via backpropagation, learning to classify defects with remarkable autonomy. Validated on real-world steel surface images, our method achieves an exceptionally low classification failure rate of just 4%, significantly enhancing efficiency and accuracy while drastically reducing data processing requirements. This paradigm-shifting solution offers a versatile blueprint for high-precision defect detection in various data-imbalanced engineering domains, promising substantial advancements in industrial automation and quality assurance.
