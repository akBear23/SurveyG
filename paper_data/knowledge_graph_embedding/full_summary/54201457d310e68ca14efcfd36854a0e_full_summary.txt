INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The pervasive "data-hungry" nature of deep learning (DL) remains a critical bottleneck for deploying robust Change Detection (CD) in real-world Remote Sensing Images (RSIs). Despite impressive fully-supervised performance, the scarcity of labeled data in diverse, dynamic environments necessitates a paradigm shift. This comprehensive survey meticulously reviews the past decade of advancements in sample-efficient DL for CD, offering an indispensable guide to navigating this complex landscape.

We systematically categorize methods across Binary, Multi-class/Semantic, and Time-series CD tasks, unveiling the burgeoning landscape of Semi-supervised, Weakly supervised, Self-supervised, and Unsupervised CD strategies. The survey highlights the transformative potential of emerging techniques such as pseudo-labeling, auxiliary regularization, and the integration of powerful Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) in mitigating data scarcity. By dissecting specialized architectures—from siamese networks to transformers and RNNs—and identifying crucial research gaps, this work provides an authoritative framework for developing more effective and widely applicable CD solutions. This survey is essential for researchers striving to unlock the full potential of DL-based CD in diverse applicational contexts and challenging incomplete supervision scenarios.
