INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
High-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) semantic segmentation is critical for diverse applications, from hazard assessment to urban planning. However, existing deep learning methods predominantly focus on visual features, largely neglecting the profound, underexplored potential of multimodal data, particularly linguistic information. We introduce **SegCLIP**, a novel network architecture that pioneers the integration of visual and linguistic semantics for HRRS image segmentation. Our approach leverages a unique **prompting strategy** to enable **CLIP** to generate semantically distinct contextual information from linguistic descriptions, effectively guiding the visual model. A novel **Cross-Modal Feature Fusion (CFF) module** ensures robust semantic consistency between modalities, further enhanced by refining ambiguous query features with additional real text data. SegCLIP establishes a new paradigm, moving beyond purely visual feature learning. Extensive experiments on LoveDA, iSAID, and UAVid datasets demonstrate SegCLIP's superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods. This work underscores the transformative power of **visual language models** and **cross-modal learning**, paving the way for more accurate and semantically intelligent remote sensing applications.

*   **Research Problem & Motivation**
    *   The paper addresses the challenge of remote sensing semantic segmentation in high-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) images \cite{zhang2024}.
    *   This problem is crucial for applications like hazard assessment, environmental monitoring, and urban planning \cite{zhang2024}.
    *   The primary challenge highlighted is that most existing deep learning methods for this task primarily focus on visual feature learning, largely neglecting the underexplored potential of multimodal data sources, particularly linguistic information \cite{zhang2024}.

    *   A technique to refine ambiguous query features using additional real text data, enhancing the model's discriminative power \cite{zhang2024}.

*   **Experimental Validation**
    *   Experiments were conducted on three public semantic segmentation datasets: LoveDA, iSAID, and UAVid \cite{zhang2024}.
    *   The key result is that the SegCLIP method exhibits **superior performance** compared to existing approaches on these benchmarks \cite{zhang2024}.
