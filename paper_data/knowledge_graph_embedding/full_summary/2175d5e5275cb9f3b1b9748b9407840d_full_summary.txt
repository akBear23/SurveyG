INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Metastasis, responsible for over 90% of cancer-related deaths, remains the most formidable challenge in oncology. This comprehensive review delves into the intricate molecular insights and therapeutic targets governing tumor invasion and organ-tropic metastasis, providing a critical synthesis of the field. We systematically examine the sequential processes and underlying mechanisms driving malignant progression to secondary sites, integrating the pivotal "seed and soil" hypothesis with the "multiclonal metastasis" theory to illuminate the complex interplay between cancer cells and their microenvironment, including pre-metastatic niche formation and immune evasion. The paper offers an exhaustive analysis of current pharmacological, non-pharmacological, and emerging therapeutic strategies, with a particular focus on bone metastasis. By synthesizing fundamental research with clinical trials, we identify significant gaps in understanding organ-specific tropism and translating findings into targeted treatments. This review provides a robust scientific foundation for optimizing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, offering crucial insights to advance clinical management and future research in this devastating disease.

FULL SUMMARY:
==================================================
Here's a focused summary of the survey/review paper \cite{li2025} for literature review:

1.  **Review Scope & Objectives**
    *   This survey covers the molecular insights and therapeutic targets related to invasion and metastasis in cancer, focusing on the progression of malignant tumors to secondary sites.
    *   Its main objectives are to examine the sequential processes and underlying mechanisms of organ-tropic metastasis, systematically analyze therapeutic strategies, and synthesize recent advances in emerging therapeutic technologies, particularly for bone metastasis.

2.  **Literature Coverage**
    *   The paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding by integrating fundamental research with an exhaustive review of existing clinical research and trials, including pharmacological, non-pharmacological, and comprehensive management strategies.
    *   It synthesizes the "most recent advances" in emerging therapeutic technologies, indicating a focus on contemporary literature, and covers clinical studies up to its publication year (2025).

3.  **Classification Framework**
    *   The survey organizes the literature by examining the sequential processes of tumor metastasis and elucidating the mechanisms driving organ-tropic metastasis.
    *   It systematically analyzes therapeutic strategies, including those tailored to specific organ involvement (bone, brain, liver, and lung).
    *   The paper integrates two pivotal theories: the "seed and soil" hypothesis and the "multiclonal metastasis" theory, to explain metastatic processes.

4.  **Key Findings & Insights**
    *   Metastasis is a pivotal event, accounting for over 90% of cancer-related deaths, with the brain, lungs, liver, and bones being the most common sites, exhibiting distinct organ-specific dissemination patterns \cite{li2025}.
    *   The "seed and soil" theory highlights the critical interplay between cancer cell properties ("seed") and the conducive microenvironment ("soil") at metastatic sites, involving signaling molecules, ECM, pre-metastatic niche formation, and immune evasion \cite{li2025}.
    *   The "multiclonal metastasis" theory emphasizes tumor heterogeneity, where multiple genetically distinct subclones from the primary tumor contribute to metastasis, leading to variable treatment responses and resistance \cite{li2025}.
    *   The clinical significance of metastasis is underscored by its high incidence and severe impact on patient survival and quality of life across various cancer types \cite{li2025}.

5.  **Research Gaps & Future Directions**
    *   The survey identifies significant gaps in understanding the complex metastatic cascade, organ-specific tropism mechanisms, and the development of targeted treatments, as current research often focuses on specific cancer types \cite{li2025}.
    *   It highlights the challenge of translating fundamental research findings into clinical practice and the relative lack of emphasis in clinical studies on comprehensively understanding metastasis mechanisms and exploring targeted therapies \cite{li2025}.
    *   Future research should focus on identifying key challenges and proposing forward-thinking solutions to optimize and advance diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for tumor metastasis \cite{li2025}.

6.  **Survey Contribution**
    *   This survey provides a comprehensive and scientific basis for the clinical management of tumor metastasis by integrating theoretical frameworks with an exhaustive review of clinical research \cite{li2025}.
    *   It offers crucial insights to inform future research and clinical practice, aiming to foster continuous optimization and advancement of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in this critical field \cite{li2025}.
