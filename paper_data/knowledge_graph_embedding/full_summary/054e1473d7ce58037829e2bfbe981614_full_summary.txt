INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The Achilles' heel of evaluating AI in subjective tasks like Speech-Emotion Recognition (SER) lies in its very foundation: ground truth definition. Traditional aggregation rules, relying on consensus, routinely discard up to 89% of valuable, ambiguous data, creating artificially 'easier' test sets. This pervasive practice introduces significant bias, misrepresenting model performance and hindering real-world applicability by ignoring the nuanced coexistence of perceived traits.

We introduce a paradigm-shifting 'all-inclusive aggregation rule' that fundamentally redefines evaluation for subjective tasks. Our novel method retains *all* samples, including those without clear consensus, enabling comprehensive model assessment. Crucially, we propose a multi-label formulation that inherently accounts for coexisting emotions, moving beyond restrictive single-label assumptions. Experimental validation on SER demonstrates that models trained with our approach consistently achieve higher macro-F1 scores on complete, real-world test sets. This work offers a robust, less biased framework, paving the way for AI systems truly capable of navigating the inherent ambiguities of human perception.

FULL SUMMARY:
==================================================
Here's a focused summary of the paper for literature review:

*   **Research Problem & Motivation**
    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Traditional methods for defining ground truth labels in subjective tasks (e.g., speech-emotion recognition, SER) often use aggregation rules like majority or plurality, which discard data points without clear consensus.
    *   **Importance & Challenge**: This practice leads to incomplete test sets that are "easier" than practical tasks, where predictions are needed for all samples. The discarded data often contains ambiguous cues reflecting coexisting traits, and ignoring them can introduce bias into model performance evaluations, misrepresenting real-world applicability. The paper observes data loss ratios from 5.63% to 89.17% with traditional rules.

*   **Related Work & Positioning**
    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: This work directly contrasts with "most studies" that rely on single-label aggregation methods (majority/plurality rules) for creating test sets in subjective tasks.
    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Previous solutions discard valuable, ambiguous data, leading to biased performance metrics and an incomplete understanding of a model's capabilities on diverse, real-world samples. They fail to account for the coexistence of multiple perceived traits.

*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**
    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes a "flexible method named the all-inclusive aggregation rule" to evaluate SER systems on the *complete* test data, including samples without clear consensus.
    *   **Novelty**: This approach is novel because it explicitly considers *all* annotations and samples, rather than discarding those without majority agreement. It also contrasts traditional single-label formulations with a multi-label formulation to inherently account for the coexistence of emotions, which is often present in ambiguous samples.

*   **Key Technical Contributions**
    *   **Novel Method**: Introduction of the "all-inclusive aggregation rule" for evaluating subjective tasks on complete datasets.
    *   **Theoretical Insight**: Highlighting the significant data loss and potential bias in model performance evaluation caused by traditional aggregation rules.
    *   **Architectural Innovation**: Proposing and demonstrating the utility of a multi-label formulation to capture coexisting emotions, moving beyond restrictive single-label assumptions.

*   **Experimental Validation**
    *   **Experiments Conducted**: SER models were trained using data selected by the proposed all-inclusive aggregation rule. These models were then tested on the *entire* test set, which included ambiguous samples that traditional methods would discard.
    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results**: The study found that training an SER model with data selected by the all-inclusive aggregation rule consistently achieved "higher macro-F1 scores" when evaluated on the complete test set (including ambiguous samples without agreement), compared to traditional single-label formulations.

*   **Limitations & Scope**
    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The paper explicitly focuses on Speech-Emotion Recognition (SER) tasks.
    *   **Technical Limitations**: The provided text does not explicitly state technical limitations of the proposed method itself, beyond its specific application domain.

*   **Technical Significance**
    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: This work advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing a more robust and less biased method for evaluating models on subjective tasks, particularly by addressing the challenge of ambiguous data. It encourages a shift from incomplete, consensus-driven test sets to comprehensive evaluations.
    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: It paves the way for developing and evaluating models that are more capable of handling the nuances and ambiguities inherent in real-world subjective data, potentially leading to more practical and reliable AI systems in fields like emotion recognition \cite{chou2025}.
