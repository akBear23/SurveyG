INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The efficacy of Knowledge Graph Representation Learning (KGRL), also known as Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE), hinges critically on effective Negative Sampling (NS) strategies. Despite its pivotal role, a comprehensive, architecturally-driven understanding of NS methods has remained elusive. This paper presents a rigorous systematic review, meticulously analyzing 64 research papers identified through PRISMA guidelines across major scientific databases.

We introduce a novel classification framework, categorizing existing NS methods into six distinct architectural groups. For each category, we provide an in-depth overview of its underlying architecture, alongside a critical discussion of its advantages and disadvantages. This systematic approach offers invaluable insights for researchers aiming to design more effective NS methods. Furthermore, we pinpoint key unresolved research challenges and propose compelling future directions, serving as a foundational resource to propel advancements in KGRL. This survey is an indispensable guide for navigating the complex landscape of negative sampling, empowering the next generation of KGRL innovations.
