INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Knowledge reasoning using knowledge graphs has attracted much attention. However, there is difficulty in integrating various related works to realize complex reasoning with explanation using multiple knowledge graphs. To do this, I propose a reasoning framework which combines multiple knowledge graph embedding techniques with corresponding explainable AI techniques. Experiments using the third knowledge graph reasoning challenge dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework.
