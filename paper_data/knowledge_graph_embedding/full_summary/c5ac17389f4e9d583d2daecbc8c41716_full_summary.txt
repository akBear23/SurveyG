INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models are fundamental for AI applications, yet their pervasive reliance on negative sampling for training often compromises prediction accuracy and introduces performance instability. The computational and space complexity of training with *all* available data has historically rendered non-sampling approaches impractical. This paper introduces **NS-KGE (Non-Sampling Knowledge Graph Embedding)**, a novel framework that revolutionizes KGE training by enabling efficient learning from every positive and negative instance. Our core innovation lies in a sophisticated mathematical re-derivation and re-organization of the square loss function, disentangling entity and relation parameters to overcome the prohibitive computational and space bottlenecks. NS-KGE is applicable to a broad class of square-loss based KGE models, demonstrating superior prediction accuracy, enhanced stability, and remarkable learning efficiency compared to traditional negative sampling methods. This work establishes a new paradigm for KGE, paving the way for more robust and precise knowledge representation and opening new avenues for non-sampling methodologies across machine learning.

Here's a focused summary of the provided technical paper for a literature review:

*   **CITATION**: \cite{li2021}

---

1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**
    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Most Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models rely on negative sampling during training. This approach leads to unstable model performance due to the inherent uncertainty in the sampling procedure and can result in suboptimal prediction accuracy because only a subset of negative instances is considered. While a non-sampling approach (considering all negative instances) could improve accuracy and stability, it dramatically increases computational and space complexity, making it impractical for real-world KGs.
    *   **Importance and Challenge**: KGE is a critical technique for representing and manipulating large-scale, heterogeneous knowledge graphs, powering applications like search engines, recommendation systems, and question answering. The challenge lies in developing a KGE training framework that can leverage all available data (non-sampling) to achieve higher accuracy and stability, without incurring prohibitive computational and memory costs.

2.  **Related Work & Positioning**
    *   **Existing Approaches**:
        *   **Negative Sampling KGE Models**: The majority of current KGE methods (e.g., DistMult \cite{li2021}, SimplE \cite{li2021}, ComplEx \cite{li2021}, TransE \cite{li2021}, RESCAL \cite{li2021}) use negative sampling to reduce training time.
        *   **Improved Negative Sampling Strategies**: Some research attempts to mitigate the drawbacks of random sampling by employing carefully designed strategies, such as dynamic negative sampling \cite{li2021} or GAN-based generation of high-quality negative samples \cite{li2021}.
        *   **Non-Sampling in Other Domains**: Whole-data based approaches have been explored in recommendation systems and factorization machines \cite{li2021} to improve accuracy.
    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:
        *   **Negative Sampling KGEs**: Suffer from weakened prediction accuracy due to incomplete information from negative instances and unstable training results across different runs \cite{li2021}. Some models require a large number of negative samples, increasing training time.
        *   **Improved Negative Sampling**: Still fundamentally rely on sampled instances, thus not fully addressing the limitations of partial information and potential fluctuations \cite{li2021}.
        *   **Non-Sampling in Other Domains**: These methods are typically not generalizable to KGE models (especially square-loss based ones) and often focus only on time complexity, neglecting space efficiency, which necessitates batch learning \cite{li2021}.

3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**
    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes the **Efficient Non-Sampling Knowledge Graph Embedding (NS-KGE)** framework.
        *   It aims to train KGE models by considering *all* positive and negative instances, thereby eliminating the need for negative sampling.
        *   The framework is applicable to KGE models whose loss function is a square loss or can be converted into one.
        *   To overcome the dramatic increase in computational and space complexity from non-sampling, the core innovation is a **mathematical re-derivation and re-organization of the non-sampling square loss function**.
        *   The loss function is initially formulated as a sum over all possible triplets (Eq. 1) and then re-organized into terms for positive instances (`L_P`), all entities (`L_A`), and a constant (Eq. 3).
        *   For factorization-based KGE models, the scoring function `f_r(h,t)` (e.g., `e_h^T (r ⊙ e_t)`) is manipulated to express its square `f_r(h,t)^2` in a way that **disentangles the head entity, relation, and tail entity embeddings**. This disentanglement allows for a more efficient calculation of the `L_A` term, which is the most computationally expensive part.
    *   **Novelty/Difference**: The primary novelty is the development of a **general and efficient non-sampling framework for KGE** that simultaneously addresses both the time and space complexity bottlenecks. This is achieved through a sophisticated mathematical re-organization of the square loss function, enabling full-data training without sacrificing computational tractability, a significant departure from prevalent negative sampling methods.

4.  **Key Technical Contributions**
    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**:
        *   Introduction of the **Non-Sampling Knowledge Graph Embedding (NS-KGE) framework**.
        *   A novel mathematical derivation that transforms the computationally intensive non-sampling square loss into an efficient form by disentangling entity and relation parameters, thereby mitigating time and space bottlenecks.
    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: Provides a general framework applicable to a broad class of square-loss based KGE models.
    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: Demonstrates that the full non-sampling loss, traditionally considered intractable, can be made computationally efficient through algebraic manipulation, offering a new paradigm for KGE training.

5.  **Experimental Validation**
    *   **Experiments Conducted**: The NS-KGE framework was applied to four representative KGE models: DistMult \cite{li2021}, SimplE \cite{li2021}, ComplEx \cite{li2021}, and TransE \cite{li2021}. Experiments were conducted on "benchmark datasets" (specific names not provided in the excerpt).
    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:
        *   **Accuracy**: The NS-KGE framework is reported to achieve "better prediction accuracy" compared to traditional negative sampling based models.
        *   **Efficiency**: NS-KGE demonstrates "better efficiency" (shorter running time) and "better space efficiency" than existing negative sampling models.
        *   Overall, the framework "outperforms most of the models in terms of both prediction accuracy and learning efficiency" \cite{li2021}.

6.  **Limitations & Scope**
    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The NS-KGE framework is specifically designed for and applicable to **square-loss based KGE models** or models whose loss functions can be mathematically converted into a square loss format \cite{li2021}.
    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The framework is generalizable to a "large class of knowledge graph embedding models" that meet the square-loss criterion, particularly factorization-based models where the scoring function can be expressed in a separable form (e.g., `e_h^T (r ⊙ e_t)`).

7.  **Technical Significance**
    *   **Advance State-of-the-Art**: NS-KGE significantly advances the state-of-the-art in KGE by providing a robust and efficient method to overcome the long-standing issues of instability and suboptimal accuracy associated with negative sampling. It enables KGE models to learn from all available data, leading to more reliable and accurate embeddings.
    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: This work opens new research directions for developing KGE models that do not rely on sampling, potentially leading to more stable and higher-quality embeddings. The mathematical approach to optimize computational and space complexity for full-data training could also inspire similar non-sampling methodologies in other machine learning domains where sampling is currently a necessary compromise.
