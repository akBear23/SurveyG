INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Embedding (MMKGE) promises richer knowledge representation, yet its full potential is bottlenecked by conventional Negative Sampling (NS) methods. Designed for unimodal KGE, these approaches are inefficient and fail to explicitly align the heterogeneous structural and visual embeddings critical for MMKGE, treating entities as monolithic units. We introduce **Modality-Aware Negative Sampling (MANS)**, a pioneering strategy specifically engineered to address this gap.

MANS revolutionizes negative sampling with **Visual Negative Sampling (MANS-V)**, a novel modal-level technique that samples only negative visual embeddings, preserving structural context to explicitly foster modality alignment. We further present MANS-T (Two-Stage), MANS-H (Hybrid), and critically, **MANS-A (Adaptive)**, which intelligently adjusts sampling proportions based on unimodal and multi-modal score functions, eliminating manual tuning. MANS is lightweight, avoiding complex auxiliary modules, and significantly enhances computational efficiency.

Extensive experiments on link prediction and triple classification demonstrate MANS's superior performance over state-of-the-art NS methods across MMKG datasets. MANS not only boosts **Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC)** but also learns more semantically rich embeddings, paving the way for robust and efficient multi-modal representation learning and inspiring future adaptive training paradigms.

*   **CITATION**: \cite{zhang2023}

1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**
    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Existing Negative Sampling (NS) methods, widely used in Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE), are unsuitable and inefficient for Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Embedding (MMKGE) models. They fail to properly handle the multiple heterogeneous embeddings (e.g., structural and visual) associated with entities in MMKGs.
    *   **Importance & Challenge**:
        *   Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) is a critical task due to the inherent incompleteness of real-world KGs, and KGE models trained with effective NS are key to addressing it.
        *   MMKGE models leverage rich modal information, but current NS methods perform "entity-level" replacement, treating all embeddings of an entity as a single unit. This implicitly assumes modality alignment, hindering the model's ability to explicitly learn and align distinct modal embeddings (e.g., structural and visual).
        *   Many existing NS methods are computationally expensive due to complex designs (e.g., GANs, large caches, clustering), making them inefficient for MMKGE training.

2.  **Related Work & Positioning**
    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: The work builds upon general KGE methods (e.g., TransE \cite{7}, DistMult \cite{9}) and existing MMKGE frameworks (e.g., IKRL \cite{11}, TransAE \cite{13}) by specifically innovating the negative sampling component. It is compared against various state-of-the-art NS methods like No-Samp \cite{17}, NSCaching \cite{15}, SANS \cite{16}, CAKE \cite{18}, and EANS \cite{19}.
    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:
        *   **Unimodal Design**: Prior NS methods are primarily designed for unimodal KGE, where entities typically have only one structural embedding, making them ill-suited for the multi-modal nature of MMKGE.
        *   **Lack of Modality Alignment**: By performing entity-level replacement, previous NS methods overlook the crucial task of aligning different modal embeddings within an entity, leading to less comprehensive semantic information being learned.
        *   **Inefficiency**: Many existing NS approaches introduce complex auxiliary modules (e.g., GANs \cite{14}, large-scale caches \cite{15}, entity clustering \cite{19}), making them computationally expensive and not lightweight.

3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**
    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes Modality-Aware Negative Sampling (MANS) \cite{zhang2023}, a lightweight and effective NS strategy specifically for MMKGE. MANS is fundamentally based on Visual Negative Sampling (MANS-V) \cite{zhang2023} and is extended into three combined strategies: Two-Stage (MANS-T) \cite{zhang2023}, Hybrid (MANS-H) \cite{zhang2023}, and Adaptive (MANS-A) \cite{zhang2023}.
    *   **Novelty/Difference**:
        *   **Modal-Level Sampling (MANS-V) \cite{zhang2023}**: Unlike traditional entity-level NS, MANS-V samples *only* negative visual embeddings for contrast, while preserving the original structural embeddings. This fine-grained approach directly addresses the challenge of modality alignment.
        *   **Combined Strategies \cite{zhang2023}**: MANS integrates MANS-V with normal NS through structured approaches:
            *   **MANS-T**: Divides training into two stages: an initial phase for modality alignment using MANS-V, followed by a phase for plausibility discrimination using normal NS.
            *   **MANS-H**: Blends MANS-V and normal NS within each training epoch using a fixed, tunable proportion.
            *   **MANS-A**: Adaptively determines the proportion of MANS-V based on the relative scores of unimodal and multi-modal components of the score function, thereby reducing the need for manual hyper-parameter tuning.
        *   **Lightweight Design**: MANS avoids complex auxiliary modules, aiming for computational efficiency while improving the quality of negative samples for MMKGE.

4.  **Key Technical Contributions**
    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**:
        *   **Modality-Aware Negative Sampling (MANS) \cite{zhang2023}**: The first negative sampling strategy specifically designed for multi-modal knowledge graph embedding.
        *   **Visual Negative Sampling (MANS-V) \cite{zhang2023}**: A novel modal-level sampling technique that samples only negative visual embeddings to explicitly achieve modality alignment between structural and visual features.
        *   **Combined Sampling Strategies \cite{zhang2023}**: Introduction of MANS-T, MANS-H, and MANS-A, which systematically integrate modal-level and entity-level negative sampling for comprehensive training.
        *   **Adaptive Sampling Mechanism \cite{zhang2023}**: MANS-A introduces an adaptive proportion for MANS-V based on the comparison of unimodal and multi-modal scores, eliminating the need for manual tuning of this hyper-parameter.
    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: MANS-V provides a mechanism to guide the model to identify visual features corresponding to each entity, thereby strengthening the alignment between different modal embeddings.

5.  **Experimental Validation**
    *   **Experiments Conducted**:
        *   Evaluated on two core Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) tasks: link prediction and triple classification.
        *   Compared MANS \cite{zhang2023} variants against normal NS and several state-of-the-art NS methods (No-Samp \cite{17}, NSCaching \cite{15}, SANS \cite{16}, CAKE \cite{18}, EANS \cite{19}).
        *   Further analysis explored the impact of sampling proportions, the effectiveness and trend of adaptive sampling, efficiency, and the quality of learned embeddings.
    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results**:
        *   **Datasets**: Two well-known MMKG datasets: FB15K and DB15K (augmented with entity images).
        *   **Link Prediction Metrics**: Mean Rank (MR), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and Hit@K (K=1, 3, 10), using a filtered setting.
        *   **Triple Classification Metrics**: Accuracy (Acc), Precision (P), Recall (R), and F1-score (F1).
        *   **Results**: Empirical results demonstrate that MANS \cite{zhang2023} consistently outperforms existing NS baseline methods across various tasks and datasets, confirming its effectiveness in MMKGE. The paper also provides further explorations to substantiate MANS's efficiency and its ability to learn better, more semantically rich embeddings.

6.  **Limitations & Scope**
    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**:
        *   Primarily focuses on the visual modality for modal-level negative sampling; explicit extension to other modalities (e.g., text) within the sampling mechanism is not detailed.
        *   The underlying MMKGE model used for evaluation (IKRL \cite{11}) employs a TransE-based score function, which might influence the generalizability of the adaptive sampling logic to other scoring functions.
        *   Relies on pre-trained models (VGG-16 \cite{27}) for visual feature extraction.
    *   **Scope of Applicability**:
        *   Specifically designed for Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Embedding (MMKGE) models that utilize distinct embeddings for different modalities (e.g., structural and visual).
        *   Applicable to KGC tasks such as link prediction and triple classification.
        *   The "lightweight" design suggests applicability in scenarios where computational efficiency during training is a significant concern.

7.  **Technical Significance**
    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**:
        *   MANS \cite{zhang2023} is the first dedicated negative sampling strategy for MMKGE, addressing a critical gap in the field.
        *   It introduces a novel modal-level sampling paradigm that explicitly tackles the challenge of aligning heterogeneous modal embeddings, a crucial aspect overlooked by previous entity-level NS methods.
        *   Offers a lightweight and efficient alternative to complex, computationally expensive NS methods, making MMKGE training more practical.
    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:
        *   Provides a foundational NS strategy that can potentially improve the performance and robustness of future MMKGE models.
        *   The concept of modal-aware sampling could be extended to other multi-modal learning tasks beyond KGE.
        *   The adaptive sampling mechanism could inspire further research into self-tuning or context-aware training strategies in complex embedding scenarios.
        *   Encourages deeper investigation into the interplay between negative sampling strategies and modality alignment in multi-modal representation learning.
