INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Unlocking the full potential of interconnected knowledge graphs demands robust **entity alignment (EA)**. This comprehensive survey critically analyzes the latest advancements in **representation learning** and **graph embedding** based EA, addressing critical gaps in existing literature by incorporating cutting-edge models and multimodal approaches. We introduce a novel, three-module framework—**Information Aggregation, Alignment, and Post-Alignment**—to systematically categorize and understand diverse EA methodologies. Our analysis reveals the profound impact of integrating **global structure embedding** with **local semantic information** for superior accuracy, and provides crucial insights into alignment direction and noise filtering strategies. Covering both **unimodal** and **multimodal EA**, including recent developments in Chinese EA, this paper offers a comparative analysis of state-of-the-art models. We identify pressing research gaps, particularly in incorporating diverse modalities like video, constructing realistic multi-dimensional datasets, and handling **dynamic knowledge graphs**. This survey serves as an authoritative guide, providing researchers with a crucial reference for optimizing current EA models and charting innovative future directions, including **non-alignable entity prediction** and complex vector spaces.
