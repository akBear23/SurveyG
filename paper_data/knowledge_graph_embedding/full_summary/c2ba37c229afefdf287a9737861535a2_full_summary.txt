INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The burgeoning complexity of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) demands sophisticated solutions to overcome the limitations of symbolic logic and enhance computational efficiency. This survey delves into Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE), a transformative paradigm that projects entities and relations into low-dimensional vector spaces. We present a novel, structured classification of KGE models, categorizing them into translational distance, semantic matching, and neural network-based approaches.

Our comprehensive analysis reveals KGE's profound impact, significantly boosting computational efficiency and manageability while serving as powerful pre-trained models for diverse downstream deep learning applications. A meticulous comparative study elucidates the unique advantages and disadvantages of each model type, showcasing their broad utility across various domains. Beyond current successes, we pinpoint critical challenges hindering KGE's full potential and illuminate promising future research directions. This paper offers an indispensable, panoramic resource for researchers and practitioners navigating the dynamic and evolving landscape of KGE.
