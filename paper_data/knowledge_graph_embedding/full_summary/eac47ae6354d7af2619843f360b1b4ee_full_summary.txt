INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Unlocking the true potential of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) hinges on a profound understanding of their underlying representation spaces. While KGE techniques have proliferated, a systematic analysis from this fundamental mathematical perspective has remained elusive. This pioneering survey addresses this critical gap, offering the first comprehensive review that classifies existing KGE models based on the **algebraic, geometric, and analytical structures** of their embedding spaces.

We reveal how the inherent properties of these diverse mathematical spaces uniquely enable the capture of distinct relational and structural patterns within Knowledge Graphs, profoundly influencing their ability to model complex KG properties like hierarchies and chains. By systematically analyzing spatial advantages and their impact on downstream tasks, this work provides unprecedented clarity into why certain spaces excel in specific scenarios. This survey not only establishes a novel mathematical spatial architecture for KGE but also offers invaluable guidance for researchers to select optimal representation spaces and design more expressive KGE models, charting a clear roadmap for future innovation in the field.

FULL SUMMARY:
==================================================
Here is a focused summary of the survey paper by \cite{cao2022} for literature review:

1.  **Review Scope & Objectives**
    *   This survey covers Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) techniques, specifically analyzing them from the novel perspective of their underlying representation spaces.
    *   Its main objectives are to systematically review existing KGE methods based on mathematical representation spaces, summarize their properties, and provide guidance for designing new KGE models.

2.  **Literature Coverage**
    *   The survey provides a systematic review of "existing KGE techniques," focusing on how different mathematical spaces are utilized.
    *   It distinguishes itself from prior KGE surveys by adopting a unique classification methodology centered on mathematical space properties, rather than encoding models or applications.

3.  **Classification Framework**
    *   The survey organizes KGE models into a fine-grained classification based on three mathematical perspectives of their representation spaces:
        *   Algebraic Structure
        *   Geometric Structure
        *   Analytical Structure

4.  **Key Findings & Insights**
    *   Different mathematical spaces possess unique strengths, enabling them to capture distinct relational and structural patterns within Knowledge Graphs.
    *   The choice of representation space significantly influences the types of KG properties (e.g., chain, ring, hierarchy) that can be effectively modeled.
    *   The survey explores how spatial advantages contribute to different embedding needs and analyzes experimental results from downstream tasks to highlight the benefits of specific mathematical spaces in various scenarios.

5.  **Research Gaps & Future Directions**
    *   The survey identifies a significant gap in existing literature, noting the absence of a systematic review of KGE methods from the perspective of mathematical spaces.
    *   It proposes promising research directions by leveraging unique properties of different mathematical spaces, encouraging researchers to consider these properties more deeply when designing KGE models and related applications.

6.  **Survey Contribution**
    *   This is the first comprehensive survey to establish a mathematical spatial architecture for KGE models, offering a novel and systematic understanding of their underlying principles.
    *   It provides valuable guidance for researchers and practitioners in selecting appropriate representation spaces and designing more expressive KGE methods.
