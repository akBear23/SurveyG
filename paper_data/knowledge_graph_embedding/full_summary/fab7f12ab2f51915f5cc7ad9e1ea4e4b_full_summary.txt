INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The landscape of speech AI is undergoing a profound transformation, mirroring the revolution brought by large language models (LLMs). This survey provides the first comprehensive and unifying review of **Spoken Language Models (SLMs)**, charting their pivotal evolution from task-specific tools to nascent universal speech processing systems. We introduce a novel classification framework, dissecting SLMs by their diverse architectures, training strategies (pre- and post-training), and evaluation choices, encompassing pure speech, speech+text, and speech-aware text models.

We systematically detail critical components like **speech encoders** (continuous features, discrete phonetic, or audio codec tokens) and **modality adapters**, revealing the intricate pathways to integrate speech. A key insight highlights the transformative potential of **end-to-end SLMs** over cascaded ASR+LLM+TTS systems, particularly for tasks requiring direct acoustic signal access or mitigating error propagation. By defining SLMs functionally as models capable of arbitrary spoken tasks via natural language instructions, we expose current limitations and identify crucial research gaps, including the urgent need for standardized terminology and evaluation. This paper offers an authoritative roadmap, contextualizing current advancements and illuminating the path towards truly universal, instruction-following speech intelligence.

FULL SUMMARY:
==================================================
Here is a focused summary of the survey paper by \cite{arora2025} for literature review:

1.  **Review Scope & Objectives**
    *   This survey covers the rapidly evolving field of spoken language models (SLMs), focusing on their shift from task-specific models to universal speech processing systems.
    *   Its main objectives are to provide a unifying literature review of recent work, categorize SLMs by architecture, training, and evaluation, and identify key challenges and future research directions.

2.  **Literature Coverage**
    *   The survey reviews recent literature, primarily from the "past few years," focusing on models that are, in principle, task-independent and accept natural language instructions rather than task tokens or soft prompts.
    *   It includes pure speech LMs, speech+text LMs, and speech-aware text LMs, aiming to collect and organize existing evaluations despite the lack of standardization.

3.  **Classification Framework**
    *   The survey categorizes SLMs based on their model architecture, training strategies, and evaluation choices.
    *   It introduces a typology of LMs, distinguishing between pure speech, speech+text, and speech-aware text models, further broken down by pre-training and post-training phases.
    *   SLM components are systematically described, including speech encoders (continuous vs. discrete features, phonetic vs. audio codec tokens), modality adapters, and sequence modeling.

4.  **Key Findings & Insights**
    *   The field is undergoing a significant shift towards universal SLMs, mirroring the progression of text-based large language models (LLMs), with diverse model types emerging.
    *   SLMs are defined functionally as models with spoken input/output, capable of arbitrary spoken language tasks via natural language instructions, though most current models do not fully meet these criteria.
    *   Different approaches exist for speech encoding (e.g., continuous features from SSL models vs. discrete phonetic or audio codec tokens) and for integrating speech with text (e.g., joint modeling vs. speech-aware text LMs).
    *   An end-to-end SLM approach is highlighted as potentially superior to cascaded ASR+LLM+TTS systems for tasks requiring acoustic signal access or to avoid error compounding.

5.  **Research Gaps & Future Directions**
    *   The survey identifies a lack of standardized terminology and evaluation settings, making it difficult to compare different SLM approaches.
    *   Future research should focus on developing models that fully satisfy the criteria for universal speech processing systems, particularly those with both spoken input and output, and the ability to handle arbitrary tasks via natural language instructions.

6.  **Survey Contribution**
    *   This survey provides a unique and comprehensive overview of the SLM landscape, offering a unified formulation and terminology to help contextualize new models.
    *   It serves as an authoritative snapshot of the current state, detailing successes and limitations on the path toward universal speech processing systems.
