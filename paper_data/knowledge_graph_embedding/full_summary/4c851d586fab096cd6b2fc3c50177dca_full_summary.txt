INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The convergence of nanophotonics and machine learning, forming 'intelligent nanophotonics,' promises to revolutionize AI hardware. This comprehensive survey by Wu et al. reviews a decade of transformative advancements, highlighting deep learning's pivotal role in accelerating nanophotonic device design and versatile optical information processing. We introduce a novel classification framework, organizing progress across intelligent free-space (e.g., diffractive, metasurface), on-chip integrated, and reconfigurable photonic neural networks. These emerging optical computing platforms offer unprecedented advantages in speed, energy efficiency, and parallelism, poised to revolutionize computational imaging, sensing, and machine vision.

However, significant challenges persist in achieving digital ANN-comparable versatility, accuracy, and generalizability, alongside developing effective training strategies (e.g., in-situ learning) and efficient nonlinear activation functions. This review critically identifies these gaps, outlining crucial future directions from light-weight models to seamless optoelectronic integration. Serving as an authoritative reference, this work illuminates the path for intelligent photonics, guiding researchers toward universally accessible and high-performance AI systems.
