INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Is graph learning at a crossroads? Despite its explosive growth, we argue that the field's foundational **benchmarking** practices are critically flawed, jeopardizing its relevance and hindering the development of truly impactful **graph foundation models**. Current **evaluation** protocols are often confined to narrow domains like 2D molecular graphs, neglecting transformative real-world challenges in **combinatorial optimization**, **relational databases**, and **chip design**. We expose how arbitrary graph constructions, poor data abstractions, inconsistent dataset splits, and an overemphasis on marginal accuracy gains incentivize overfitting and stifle **generalizability**.

This paper advocates for a fundamental paradigm shift: moving beyond saturated datasets and towards "natural" graph problems with clear real-world justification. We propose a rigorous framework for **benchmarking** that demands explicit discussion of graph structure advantages, includes baselines for unstructured data, and prioritizes the development of large-scale, high-quality, and diverse datasets. Adopting this vision will unlock the true potential of **graph learning**, fostering **scalable** and generalizable solutions, and ensuring the field delivers on its promise of transformative applications. It's time to re-evaluate how we measure progress to build the next generation of intelligent systems.

FULL SUMMARY:
==================================================
Here is a focused summary of the position paper for literature review:

1.  **Position Statement & Thesis** (2-3 sentences)
    The paper argues that graph learning is at risk of losing its relevance and impact due to significant shortcomings in current benchmarking practices \cite{bechlerspeicher2025}. It advocates for a fundamental paradigm shift towards more meaningful benchmarks and rigorous evaluation to unlock the field's true potential \cite{bechlerspeicher2025}.

2.  **Current State Critique** (2-3 sentences)
    Current benchmarks are criticized for their narrow focus on domains like 2D molecular graphs, neglecting transformative real-world applications such as combinatorial optimization or chip design \cite{bechlerspeicher2025}. Additionally, many datasets poorly represent underlying data, leading to inadequate abstractions, fragmented evaluations, and an excessive focus on accuracy that incentivizes overfitting \cite{bechlerspeicher2025}.

3.  **Supporting Arguments** (3-4 bullet points)
    *   Benchmarks often feature narrow domains (e.g., 2D molecular graphs) that lack real-world justification and neglect critical information like 3D geometric structures \cite{bechlerspeicher2025}.
    *   Graphs are frequently constructed arbitrarily (e.g., from vision or spatiotemporal data) or without clear justification for the chosen relational structure, sometimes even encoding spurious correlations \cite{bechlerspeicher2025}.
    *   Methodological shortcomings include inconsistent dataset splits, unreliable evaluation protocols, reliance on small datasets with high variance, and an overemphasis on marginal performance gains without statistical significance \cite{bechlerspeicher2025}.
    *   These issues collectively hinder the development of scalable, generalizable graph foundation models, as current practices do not foster insights beyond specific, often saturated, tasks \cite{bechlerspeicher2025}.

4.  **Proposed Vision/Direction** (2-3 sentences)
    The field should shift its focus to "natural" graph problems with clear real-world impact, such as combinatorial optimization, relational databases, and chip design \cite{bechlerspeicher2025}. New benchmarks must explicitly discuss the advantages of graph structures, include baselines that process unstructured sets, and promote the development of large-scale, high-quality, and diverse datasets \cite{bechlerspeicher2025}.

5.  **Implications & Impact** (2-3 sentences)
    Adopting this position would lead to more impactful and reliable advances in graph learning, moving beyond incremental gains on saturated datasets \cite{bechlerspeicher2025}. It would enable the development of truly useful graph foundation models and foster a deeper understanding of when and how graph structures provide genuine advantages \cite{bechlerspeicher2025}.

6.  **Limitations & Counterarguments** (1-2 sentences)
    The paper implicitly acknowledges challenges such as the inherent difficulty of scaling sophisticated architectures to larger graphs and the community's current focus on specific, easier-to-handle settings \cite{bechlerspeicher2025}. It also notes the difficulty in evaluating the quality of generated graphs without ground-truth data, which is a challenge for graph generation tasks \cite{bechlerspeicher2025}.

7.  **Position Significance** (1-2 sentences)
    This position paper is crucial for guiding the future trajectory of graph learning research by advocating for a critical re-evaluation of its foundational benchmarking practices \cite{bechlerspeicher2025}. It aims to ensure the field's continued relevance and ability to deliver transformative real-world applications \cite{bechlerspeicher2025}.
