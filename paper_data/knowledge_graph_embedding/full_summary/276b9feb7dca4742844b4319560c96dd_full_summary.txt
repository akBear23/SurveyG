INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The promise of graph embedding learning is often hampered by system inefficiencies and a lack of generality. Existing platforms suffer from debilitating CPU time and excessive CPU-GPU communication overhead, especially in multi-GPU environments, while the critical diversity of negative sampling algorithms remains difficult to implement. We present GE2, a groundbreaking system engineered for both general and highly efficient graph embedding learning.

GE2 introduces a novel execution model and an intuitive API that unify and simplify the expression of diverse negative sampling strategies. Its unparalleled efficiency is achieved by intelligently offloading computationally intensive operations to the GPU, harnessing massive parallelism. A core innovation is the **COVER algorithm**, the first of its kind to manage multi-GPU data swap with unprecedentedly minimal communication costs. Rigorous evaluations show GE2 delivers up to 7.5x speedups against state-of-the-art systems. GE2 not only dramatically accelerates graph embedding research and real-world deployment but also establishes a new paradigm for scalable, general, and efficient distributed machine learning.
