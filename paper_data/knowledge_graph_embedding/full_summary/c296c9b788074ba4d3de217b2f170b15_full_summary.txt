INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Unsupervised visual representation learning is paramount for reducing reliance on massive labeled datasets, yet building effective, large, and consistent "dictionaries" for contrastive learning remains a significant hurdle. This paper introduces Momentum Contrast (MoCo), a novel framework that re-conceptualizes contrastive learning as a dynamic dictionary look-up. MoCo's core innovation lies in its architecture: a dynamic dictionary built with a queue and a moving-averaged encoder, enabling the creation of a large and consistent set of negative samples on-the-fly. This breakthrough design allows for robust unsupervised learning. We demonstrate MoCo's efficacy through extensive experiments, achieving competitive performance on ImageNet classification. More remarkably, representations learned by MoCo transfer exceptionally well, *outperforming supervised pre-training* on 7 diverse detection and segmentation tasks across PASCAL VOC and COCO. Our findings suggest that unsupervised pre-training can not only match but even surpass supervised counterparts for transfer learning, heralding a paradigm shift in computer vision model development.
