INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Unlocking the genetic potential of recalcitrant crops like cucurbits remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to low genetic transformation and gene-editing efficiencies compounded by undesirable pleiotropic effects of morphogenic genes. Here, we present a groundbreaking strategy that dramatically enhances genetic modification in cucurbits by leveraging overexpression of *Arabidopsis thaliana GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR 5* (*AtGRF5*) via one-step de novo shoot organogenesis (DNSO).

Our comprehensive multi-omics analysis, integrating time-series transcriptomics, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and DNA-affinity purification sequencing (DAP-seq), reveals the intricate molecular mechanism: *AtGRF5* orchestrates regeneration by inducing auxin-related genes and expanding stem cell populations, directly targeting *CsIAA19* as a pivotal downstream regulator. Crucially, we developed an innovative abscisic acid (ABA)-inducible *AtGRF5* expression system. This system precisely controls *AtGRF5* activity, effectively mitigating pleiotropic growth defects while maintaining superior transformation and gene-editing efficiencies across diverse genotypes. This work not only provides unprecedented mechanistic insights into *AtGRF5*-mediated regeneration but also offers a powerful, broadly applicable solution to overcome recalcitrance, paving the way for accelerated gene functional analysis and precision crop improvement.
