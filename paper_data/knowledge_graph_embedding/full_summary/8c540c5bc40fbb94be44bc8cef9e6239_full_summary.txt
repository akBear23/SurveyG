INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The relentless pursuit of AI scale has pushed traditional model-centric optimization to its limits, revealing a critical paradigm shift: the dominant computational bottleneck has moved from model size to the quadratic cost of self-attention over increasingly long token sequences in large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs). This paper argues for a fundamental reorientation of AI efficiency efforts towards **data-centric compression**, specifically **token compression**, as the new frontier. We present a comprehensive analysis demonstrating this bottleneck transition and introduce a novel mathematical framework unifying diverse efficiency strategies, theoretically underscoring token compression's crucial role. Through a systematic review, we categorize existing methods and highlight their compelling advantages: offering quadratic speedup in computation, linear memory savings, and broad compatibility without architectural overhauls. Adopting this vision promises to unlock next-generation LLMs and MLLMs, enabling unprecedented context lengths, faster training, and reduced resource consumption, thereby sustaining the advancement of AI in an era of ever-growing data.

FULL SUMMARY:
==================================================
Here's a focused summary of the position paper for literature review:

*   **1. Position Statement & Thesis**
    The paper argues that the AI community's focus for efficiency optimization must shift from model-centric to data-centric compression \cite{liu2025}. It advocates for token compression as the new frontier to improve AI efficiency by reducing the number of tokens during training or inference, directly addressing the quadratic cost of self-attention over increasingly long token sequences \cite{liu2025}.

*   **2. Current State Critique**
    Historically, AI advancement relied on model-centric scaling (increasing parameters), but this approach has reached hardware limits \cite{liu2025}. The dominant computational bottleneck has fundamentally shifted from model size to the quadratic cost of self-attention over ultra-long token sequences in large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) \cite{liu2025}. Traditional model-centric compression techniques are thus becoming less effective for the current primary bottleneck \cite{liu2025}.

*   **3. Supporting Arguments**
    *   **Shift in Bottleneck:** A comprehensive analysis reveals a critical transition from parameter-centric to context-centric computational bottlenecks across various AI domains (LLMs, MLLMs, generative models), necessitating a paradigm shift in efficiency optimization \cite{liu2025}.
    *   **Unified Framework:** The paper establishes a mathematical formulation that unifies different model efficiency strategies, theoretically demonstrating why token compression is crucial for addressing long-context overhead \cite{liu2025}.
    *   **Systematic Review:** It provides a thorough review of token compression methods, categorizing approaches (e.g., parametric/non-parametric criteria, pruning/merging strategies) and analyzing their benefits and trade-offs across diverse scenarios \cite{liu2025}.
    *   **Compelling Advantages:** Token compression offers significant benefits in terms of universality, efficiency (quadratic speedup in computation, linear in memory), and compatibility (often without architectural modification or retraining) during both training and inference stages \cite{liu2025}.

*   **4. Proposed Vision/Direction**
    The paper proposes that the AI community should adopt data-centric compression, specifically token compression, as the primary strategy for efficiency optimization \cite{liu2025}. The field should focus on developing and refining methods that directly reduce token redundancy in model inputs to mitigate the computational overhead of long context lengths \cite{liu2025}.

*   **5. Implications & Impact**
    Adopting this position would lead to more efficient next-generation LLMs and MLLMs, enabling faster training iterations, larger batch sizes, and reduced memory usage on fixed hardware resources \cite{liu2025}. It aims to catalyze innovative developments, allowing for continued performance gains and addressing the challenges that increasing context lengths pose to AI advancement \cite{liu2025}.

*   **6. Limitations & Counterarguments**
    While token pruning offers direct computation reduction, it "risks information loss, particularly for fine-grained tasks" \cite{liu2025}. The paper also acknowledges and outlines current challenges in token compression research, indicating that it is an evolving field with complexities yet to be fully resolved \cite{liu2025}.

*   **7. Position Significance**
    This position paper offers a fresh perspective on AI efficiency, synthesizing existing research and highlighting a crucial paradigm shift needed to sustain the advancement of AI models \cite{liu2025}. It aims to catalyze future research efforts towards more efficient and effective token compression methods, guiding the field to overcome current computational bottlenecks \cite{liu2025}.
