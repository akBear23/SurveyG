INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are indispensable for AI, yet their real-world utility is severely compromised by pervasive erroneous triples, a critical challenge most KG embedding algorithms fundamentally overlook. We introduce Attributed Error-aware Knowledge Embedding (AEKE), a novel framework designed to learn robust KG embeddings by intelligently mitigating the impact of these inaccuracies. AEKE innovatively leverages rich entity attributes, constructing two distinct triple-level hypergraphs to model both KG topological structures and their associated attribute semantics.

At its core, AEKE develops a sophisticated joint confidence scoring mechanism, assessing each triple based on self-contradiction, local-global structure consistency, and structure-attribute homogeneity. These dynamic confidence scores then adaptively weight aggregation within a multi-view graph learning framework and modify the margin loss, effectively minimizing the contribution of potential errors during embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate AEKE's superior performance, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art KG embedding and error detection methods on three real-world KGs. AEKE marks a pivotal advancement, paving the way for more reliable and robust KG applications in the face of inherent data imperfections.

### Focused Summary for Literature Review

1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**
    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Addressing the issue of erroneous triples inevitably injected during Knowledge Graph (KG) construction, which most existing KG embedding algorithms assume to be correct.
    *   **Importance & Challenge**: Errors in KGs lead to significant performance degradation in downstream applications, making the development of effective error-aware KG embedding urgent and challenging.

2.  **Related Work & Positioning**
    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: This work positions itself against "most KG embedding algorithms" that operate under the assumption of perfect data quality.
    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Previous solutions fail to account for errors, leading to performance degradation when KGs contain inaccuracies.

    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes Attributed Error-aware Knowledge Embedding (AEKE), a novel framework that leverages entity attributes to guide KG embedding model learning.
    *   **Novelty**: AEKE integrates attribute semantics to mitigate the impact of erroneous triples. It designs two triple-level hypergraphs (for KG topology and attributes) and calculates a joint confidence score for each triple. This score is based on self-contradiction, local-global structure consistency, and structure-attribute homogeneity. These confidence scores then adaptively weight aggregation in a multi-view graph learning framework and modify the margin loss in KG embedding, effectively reducing the contribution of potential errors.

4.  **Key Technical Contributions**
    *   **Novel Framework**: Introduction of AEKE, a comprehensive framework for error-aware KG embedding \cite{zhang2024}.

    *   **Error-Aware Learning Mechanism**: Integration of these confidence scores to adaptively weight aggregation in multi-view graph learning and modify the margin loss, ensuring erroneous triples contribute minimally to KG learning \cite{zhang2024}.

5.  **Experimental Validation**
    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Experiments were performed to evaluate AEKE's performance against existing methods.
    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Results**: AEKE demonstrated superior performance, outperforming state-of-the-art KG embedding and error detection algorithms on three real-world KGs \cite{zhang2024}.

6.  **Limitations & Scope**
    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The approach heavily relies on the availability and quality of entity attributes to guide error detection and embedding. Its effectiveness might be reduced in KGs with sparse or low-quality attribute information.
    *   **Scope of Applicability**: Primarily applicable to KGs where entity attributes are available and can provide meaningful semantic context for error detection.

7.  **Technical Significance**
    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: AEKE significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing an effective, attribute-aware mechanism to learn robust KG embeddings in the presence of errors, a critical challenge for real-world KG applications \cite{zhang2024}.
