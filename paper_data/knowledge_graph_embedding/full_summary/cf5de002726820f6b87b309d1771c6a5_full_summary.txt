INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
In many fields, such as social networks and recommendation systems with high time requirements, fake news and false information are often released in real time, impacting on people’s daily life. Entity alignment (EA) in temporal knowledge graph (TKG) can fuse the information contained in entities by finding equivalent entities, thus helping to determine the regular pattern of disinformation under time change. The existing methods either ignore the use of temporal attributes’ information and structural information or the modeling of that is insufficient, which has become a major obstacle to the further and wider application of TKG EA. In this article, we put forward a new idea of training for the processing of time attributes and relational structure information, to further enhance the ability in the EA process of TKGs. By forming box embedding matrix and name embedding matrix, and adaptively fusing the above information, we propose a new TKG EA solution. We carry out comparative experiments on standard news media and social media datasets collected from the real world, which validates the effectiveness of our proposal.
