INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Over the last decade, service selection and recommendation had been two strongly related service filtering steps. While service selection aims to filter the best available services according to QoS and contextual criteria, service recommendation refines the selection results by taking into account additional criteria, such as users feedbacks and ratings, similarities between users tastes, etc. However, the ever changing services environment, users tastes, as well as the perception and popularity of available services, rise a question regarding the appropriate means to capture and analyze such changes over time. Most service recommendation solutions are static and do not offer a multi-relational modeling of user-service interactions over time. Time is a contextual dimension that has, recently, received a lot of attention, leading to a new class of recommender systems, called time-aware recommender systems. In this work, we propose a service recommendation method that takes advantage of temporal knowledge graphs. As a de facto standard to model multiple and complex interactions between heterogeneous entities, knowledge graphs will serve as a historical knowledge base for our TASR system. We, first, model the user-service interactions over time, by constructing a temporal service knowledge graph (TSKG) that will be later enriched through a completion step. Second, to explore the TSKG and extract top-rated services, we use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to embed the TSKG into a low-dimensional vector space, facilitating then its mining. Experimental studies have proven the effectiveness and accuracy of our approach, compared to traditional TASR methods and time-unaware KG-based recommendation.

Over the last decade, service selection and recommendation had been two strongly related service filtering steps. While service selection aims to filter the best available services according to QoS and contextual criteria, service recommendation refines the selection results by taking into account additional criteria, such as users feedbacks and ratings, similarities between users tastes, etc. However, the ever changing services environment, users tastes, as well as the perception and popularity of available services, rise a question regarding the appropriate means to capture and analyze such changes over time. Most service recommendation solutions are static and do not offer a multi-relational modeling of user-service interactions over time. Time is a contextual dimension that has, recently, received a lot of attention, leading to a new class of recommender systems, called time-aware recommender systems. In this work, we propose a service recommendation method that takes advantage of temporal knowledge graphs. As a de facto standard to model multiple and complex interactions between heterogeneous entities, knowledge graphs will serve as a historical knowledge base for our TASR system. We, first, model the user-service interactions over time, by constructing a temporal service knowledge graph (TSKG) that will be later enriched through a completion step.
