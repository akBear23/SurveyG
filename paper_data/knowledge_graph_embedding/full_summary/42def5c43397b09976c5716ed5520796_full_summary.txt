INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Accurately representing the complex interplay of hierarchical structures and logical patterns remains a formidable challenge in Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE). While Euclidean methods falter with hierarchies and existing hyperbolic embeddings often overlook crucial logical dependencies, a fundamental gap persists. We introduce a novel KGE model that bridges this divide by leveraging an **extended Poincaré Ball** and a **polar coordinate system** within hyperbolic space.

Our approach innovatively addresses the inherent limitations of hyperbolic embeddings. We propose a unique method to handle Poincaré Ball boundary conditions by expanding the modulus length, effectively stretching and zooming the boundary to accommodate diverse knowledge graph structures. Furthermore, we employ tangent space and exponential transformation for robust vector initialization and mapping into this specialized hyperbolic space. This powerful combination allows our model to simultaneously capture both intricate hierarchical relationships and complex logical patterns with unprecedented fidelity. Experimental validation demonstrates that our method achieves new state-of-the-art results on part of link prediction tasks, significantly advancing the field. This work paves the way for designing more sophisticated hyperbolic embedding spaces, promising more accurate and robust knowledge graph reasoning and completion systems.

Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for literature review:

*   **Research Problem & Motivation**
    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Existing Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) methods, primarily based on Euclidean space, struggle to effectively model and represent the inherent hierarchical structures present in knowledge graphs. While hyperbolic embeddings show promise for hierarchical data, they often fail to adequately capture the logical patterns within knowledge graphs \cite{pan2021}.
    *   **Importance and Challenge**: Accurately representing hierarchical structures and logical patterns is crucial for robust knowledge graph completion and reasoning. The challenge lies in developing an embedding space that can simultaneously capture both the complex hierarchical relationships and the logical dependencies without sacrificing representation fidelity or conciseness.

    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: This work builds upon the advancements in KGE, specifically addressing the limitations of both Euclidean and existing hyperbolic embedding methods \cite{pan2021}.
    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:
        *   **Euclidean Space Methods**: Inefficient at handling hierarchical structures, leading to suboptimal representations for such data.
        *   **Hyperbolic Embedding Methods**: While good for hierarchies, they often do not adequately consider or capture the logical patterns inherent in knowledge graphs \cite{pan2021}.
