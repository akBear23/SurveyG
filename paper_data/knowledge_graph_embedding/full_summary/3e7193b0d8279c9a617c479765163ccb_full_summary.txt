INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Modern manufacturing demands sophisticated scheduling that extends beyond mere makespan optimization. The Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) traditionally overlooks critical real-world factors like varied transportation times and total energy consumption, leading to suboptimal production. This paper introduces a novel, comprehensive multi-target FJSP formulation that explicitly integrates makespan, transportation times, and energy consumption. To tackle this highly complex problem, we propose an end-to-end multiagent Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) framework. Our approach innovatively represents the scheduling environment as a Disjunctive Graph (DG), where arcs precisely capture transportation and standby times. A Graph Neural Network (GNN) then encodes these rich DG features into robust state representations for the PPO agents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art solutions across all metrics, delivering superior solution quality, online computation efficiency, stability, and generalization capability. This work establishes a powerful new paradigm for real-time, multi-objective industrial scheduling, paving the way for more sustainable and efficient smart manufacturing.
