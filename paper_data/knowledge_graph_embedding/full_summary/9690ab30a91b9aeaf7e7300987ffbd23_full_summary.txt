INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The relentless demand for intelligent and efficient wireless communication in emerging applications necessitates a paradigm shift beyond traditional approaches. This survey introduces **intellicise wireless networks**, a groundbreaking concept characterized by intelligence-endogenous and primitive-concise features, fundamentally reshaping how information is processed and transmitted. Crucially, we integrate the transformative lens of **semantic communication (SemCom)**, offering a unique perspective on achieving true intelligence and conciseness.

We propose a comprehensive framework for intellicise networks, meticulously dissecting its core components: the **Brain for Intellicise Wireless Networks (BIWN)**, **intellicise signal processing**, information transmission, network organization, and service bearing. Beyond outlining critical enabling technologies and driving factors, this work envisions novel applications and services, while also confronting the significant implementation challenges. By providing a holistic understanding and charting crucial future research directions, this survey serves as an indispensable guide for researchers navigating the frontier of intelligent, resource-efficient wireless communication.
