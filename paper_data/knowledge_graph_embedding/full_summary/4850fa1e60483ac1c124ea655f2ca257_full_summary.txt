INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The convergence of vision and language is ushering in a new era of AI, with Multimodal Vision Language Models (VLMs) at its forefront. This comprehensive survey meticulously maps the VLM landscape from 2019 to 2025, systematically categorizing 54 vision-language benchmarks and detailing state-of-the-art models. We uncover a pivotal architectural shift: from training VLMs from scratch to leveraging powerful pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) as backbones, significantly enhancing multimodal reasoning. The increasing adoption of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and its variants for robust multimodal alignment, safety, and human preference is also critically examined. Despite unprecedented progress, VLMs grapple with persistent challenges like visual hallucination and the inherent complexity of multimodal alignment, often overlooked compared to unimodal LLMs. Our analysis reveals a critical need for improved evaluation quality over mere data diversity in current benchmarks. This paper serves as an authoritative resource, offering a systematic overview, critical examination of trends, and identification of crucial research avenues, making it an indispensable guide for navigating the future of multimodal AI.

FULL SUMMARY:
==================================================
Here is a focused summary of the survey paper for literature review:

1.  **Review Scope & Objectives**
    *   This survey covers the rapidly evolving domain of Multimodal Vision Language Models (VLMs), which integrate visual and textual modalities for perception and reasoning.
    *   Its main objectives are to provide a systematic overview of major VLM models, analyze architectural transitions and alignment methods, summarize popular benchmarks and evaluation metrics, and identify current challenges.

2.  **Literature Coverage**
    *   The survey reviews VLM developments from 2019 up to 2025, including a detailed table of state-of-the-art models released by the end of 2024.
    *   It systematically categorizes and summarizes 54 vision-language benchmarks, discussing various data collection methodologies.

3.  **Classification Framework**
    *   The literature is primarily organized around four key aspects: model information and architectural evolution, VLM alignment methods, benchmarks and evaluation strategies, and inherent challenges.
    *   Architectures are classified by their training approach (from scratch vs. using pre-trained LLMs as backbones) and newer fusion techniques (e.g., treating all modalities as tokens).
    *   Benchmarks are categorized into ten primary types based on their specific testing objectives (e.g., math reasoning, scene recognition).

4.  **Key Findings & Insights**
    *   A significant trend is the architectural shift from training VLMs from scratch to leveraging powerful pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) as backbones, enhancing multimodal reasoning \cite{li2025}.
    *   Alignment methods, particularly Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and its variants, are increasingly adopted to improve VLM performance, safety, and human preference alignment \cite{li2025}.
    *   The field has seen a rapid proliferation of VLM benchmarks since 2022, moving beyond simple tasks to evaluate a wider range of complex multimodal abilities \cite{li2025}.
    *   VLMs face distinct challenges such as visual hallucination (generating responses without true visual comprehension) and the complexity of multimodal alignment compared to unimodal LLMs \cite{li2025}.

5.  **Research Gaps & Future Directions**
    *   The survey identifies a critical gap in VLM alignment research, noting that these problems are less considered than those for text-only LLMs, despite the added complexity of multimodal contexts \cite{li2025}.
    *   It highlights that current benchmarks often prioritize data diversity and quantity over improvements in evaluation quality, hindering effective assessment of VLM capabilities \cite{li2025}.

6.  **Survey Contribution**
    *   This paper provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of the state-of-the-art in VLMs, offering a critical examination of major architectures, alignment techniques, and evaluation practices.
    *   It serves as an authoritative resource by detailing the rapid advancements, identifying key trends, and outlining significant challenges and future research avenues in the field \cite{li2025}.
