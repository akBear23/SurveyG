INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The intricate, non-Euclidean nature of graph data presents a formidable challenge for traditional deep learning architectures. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a revolutionary paradigm, transforming how we process complex relational information. This comprehensive survey cuts through the complexity, offering a novel and meticulously structured taxonomy that categorizes state-of-the-art GNNs into four pivotal classes: **recurrent GNNs, convolutional GNNs, graph autoencoders, and spatial-temporal GNNs**.

Beyond classification, we illuminate how GNNs successfully extend **deep learning** to complex **graph data**, demonstrating their profound applicability across diverse domains in **data mining** and **machine learning**. The paper synthesizes crucial practical resources, including available **open-source codes** and **benchmark datasets**, essential for accelerating research and development. By providing a structured understanding of this rapidly evolving field and identifying critical future research directions, this survey serves as an indispensable guide for researchers navigating the frontiers of deep learning on graphs, aiming to inspire innovation and unlock the full potential of GNNs.
