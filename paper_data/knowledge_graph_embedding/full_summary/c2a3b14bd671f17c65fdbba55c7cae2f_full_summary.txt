INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The advent of foundation models, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and World Models, promises a transformative leap for autonomous driving. Yet, a critical void persists: a comprehensive, structured understanding of their true challenges, opportunities, and future applications. This position paper addresses this gap, moving beyond initial hype to provide a foundational outlook and roadmap for the field.

We meticulously analyze the immense potential of generative AI and multimodal foundation models for achieving human-like perception, sophisticated decision-making, and advanced tool use in complex driving scenarios. Crucially, we summarize existing methods, rigorously explore their inherent limitations within the autonomous driving context, and discuss the applicability of emerging approaches such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and the Mamba architecture. By highlighting key open questions and proposing a strategic direction, this paper advocates for a more informed, critical, and safety-conscious integration of these powerful AI paradigms. It serves as an essential guide for researchers and practitioners, fostering a proactive and structured development path for the next generation of autonomous systems.

FULL SUMMARY:
==================================================
Here is a focused summary of the position paper for literature review:

1.  **Position Statement & Thesis**
    The paper argues for the critical need for a comprehensive understanding of the key challenges, opportunities, and future applications of foundation models (like Large Language Models and World Models) in autonomous driving \cite{ma2025}. It advocates for a structured outlook to guide the field's development beyond merely recognizing their enormous potential.

2.  **Current State Critique**
    The primary limitation identified is a "lack of comprehensive understanding" regarding the full scope of challenges, opportunities, and future applications of emerging foundation models in driving systems \cite{ma2025}. Despite widespread attention and demonstrated potential, current approaches lack sufficient analysis of their practical implications and limitations.

3.  **Supporting Arguments**
    *   Generative AI and multimodal foundation models show immense potential for human-like perception, data collection, decision-making, and tool use in autonomous driving \cite{ma2025}.
    *   The paper supports its position by summarizing existing methods and thoroughly exploring their inherent limitations within the autonomous driving context \cite{ma2025}.
    *   It discusses the applicability of specific emerging approaches, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Mamba, for autonomous driving applications \cite{ma2025}.
    *   The paper highlights open questions, indicating areas where current understanding is incomplete and further research is needed \cite{ma2025}.

4.  **Proposed Vision/Direction**
    The paper proposes a future direction focused on developing a comprehensive understanding of foundation models in autonomous driving, moving beyond initial potential to address practical challenges and opportunities \cite{ma2025}. It suggests exploring emerging approaches like RLHF and Mamba and prioritizing the resolution of identified open questions to guide future research.

5.  **Implications & Impact**
    Adopting this position would lead to a more structured, critical, and informed approach to integrating foundation models into autonomous driving, moving beyond initial hype to address practical implementation and safety concerns \cite{ma2025}. It implies a shift towards deeper analysis of limitations and a proactive exploration of new, relevant AI paradigms.

6.  **Limitations & Counterarguments**
    The provided abstract does not explicitly state weaknesses of its own position or potential counterarguments. However, its nature as a "living document" suggests an acknowledgment that the field is rapidly evolving, and its insights are subject to continuous change and refinement \cite{ma2025}.

7.  **Position Significance**
    This position paper is important for providing a foundational "outlook" and roadmap for researchers and practitioners in autonomous driving, helping to navigate the complexities of integrating powerful but nascent foundation models \cite{ma2025}. It aims to influence future research by highlighting critical open questions and promising directions, fostering a more informed and strategic development of the field.
