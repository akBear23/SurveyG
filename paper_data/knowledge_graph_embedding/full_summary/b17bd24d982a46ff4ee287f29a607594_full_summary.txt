INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The quest to design next-generation polymers hinges on understanding the intricate link between chemical structure and macroscopic properties. This comprehensive survey illuminates the transformative potential of **machine learning (ML)** in **polymer chemistry**, uniquely bridging the disciplines of chemistry and mathematics to overcome persistent **data curation challenges**. We meticulously review ML applications across a spectrum of **polymer properties**, from **solid-state** and **solution behavior** to **composite performance**, and delve into cutting-edge domains like **drug delivery** and the **polymer-biology interface**.

Our analysis reveals critical hurdles, including limited, inadequately curated datasets, broad **molecular weight distributions**, and irregular polymer configurations, underscoring the necessity for refining off-the-shelf models. A central insight is the imperative for interdisciplinary collaboration to effectively formulate research questions and tailor ML approaches. We champion the adoption of **FAIR data principles** and advocate for deeper integration of polymer theory with **data-driven approaches**, alongside exploring the **machine-human interface**. This authoritative resource provides a roadmap for accelerating polymer discovery, offering crucial insights into current progress, challenges, and future directions for researchers at the forefront of materials innovation.
