INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The advent of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is revolutionizing artificial intelligence, profoundly impacting the remote sensing (RS) domain. Moving beyond traditional discriminative approaches, VLM-based RS methods harness powerful generative capabilities, unlocking unprecedented performance and enormous potential across diverse applications. This timely survey offers a comprehensive, structured, and detailed review of this rapidly evolving landscape, designed to guide researchers and practitioners through its complexities. We meticulously explore the fundamental theories underpinning VLMs, summarize the burgeoning datasets and specialized tasks tailored for remote sensing, and critically categorize state-of-the-art improvement methods based on their core VLM components. By providing a holistic overview of this cutting-edge trend, this paper illuminates the significant advancements and highlights the immense practical implications of VLMs in remote sensing, inspiring future innovations and accelerating progress in this vital field.
