INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The burgeoning field of Audio-Language Models (ALMs) stands at the forefront of multimodal AI, seamlessly bridging the gap between diverse audio signals and the rich understanding of natural language. This paper presents the first comprehensive and structured survey of ALMs, offering an exhaustive overview of their rapid evolution from mid-2022 to late 2024. We meticulously classify ALM architectures—including Two Towers, Two Heads, One Head, and Cooperated Systems—and training objectives (Contrastive, Generative, Discriminative), revealing how these models leverage natural language as a powerful supervision signal for robust zero-shot capabilities and flexible adaptation across diverse downstream tasks. Crucially, while research interest has increasingly shifted towards speech, we underscore the critical importance and challenges of general audio modeling—encompassing environmental events, human voices, and music. We highlight the transformative integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) as guiding components, expanding ALMs' perceptual modalities and leveraging their emergent understanding. By filling a notable gap in systematic surveys, this work provides an authoritative technical roadmap, guiding researchers through foundational datasets, pre-training advancements, and evaluation benchmarks, ultimately fostering innovation in real-world ALM applications and pushing the boundaries of multimodal AI.

FULL SUMMARY:
==================================================
Here's a focused summary of the survey paper by \cite{su2025} for literature review:

1.  **Review Scope & Objectives**
    *   This survey covers Audio-Language Models (ALMs), a rapidly advancing field at the intersection of audio processing and Natural Language Processing, focusing on their application to general audio-centric tasks.
    *   The main objectives are to provide a comprehensive, structured, and holistic overview of ALMs, addressing the current lack of systematic surveys, and to offer a clear technical roadmap for researchers.

2.  **Literature Coverage**
    *   The survey reviews recent advances in ALM research, with a timeline highlighting developments from mid-2022 to late 2024, including foundational datasets, pre-training, downstream models, and benchmarks.
    *   It aims for exhaustive coverage of the entire ALM research landscape from the perspective of model training, encompassing various audio types beyond just speech.

3.  **Classification Framework**
    *   The survey organizes ALM research into three main fields: (a) pre-training for representation learning, (b) downstream transfer, and (c) datasets and benchmarks.
    *   It categorizes ALM architectures into four types: Two Towers, Two Heads, One Head, and Cooperated Systems.
    *   Training objectives are classified as Contrastive, Generative, or Discriminative, used during both pre-training and transfer stages.

4.  **Key Findings & Insights**
    *   ALMs leverage natural language as a powerful supervision signal, enabling strong zero-shot capabilities and flexible adaptation to diverse downstream tasks, enhancing accuracy and generalization beyond traditional supervised methods.
    *   The field is driven by the intertwined development of large-scale datasets, pre-training techniques, and downstream applications, with CLAP identified as a significant milestone.
    *   While research interest has increasingly shifted towards the speech domain, the survey emphasizes the significant challenges and importance of general audio modeling, which encompasses environmental events, human voices, and music.
    *   The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) as guiding components within ALMs is a major trend, expanding their perceptual modalities and leveraging emergent understanding capabilities.

5.  **Research Gaps & Future Directions**
    *   The survey identifies a notable lack of systematic surveys, which it aims to fill, and points to the need for unified evaluation standards, leading to the development of various benchmarks.
    *   It implicitly suggests future directions in improving generalization across a broad spectrum of downstream tasks, enhancing understanding of complex real-world audio, and developing more robust evaluation benchmarks.

6.  **Survey Contribution**
    *   This paper provides the first comprehensive survey on ALMs, offering an exhaustive and structured overview of the field from the perspective of model training.
    *   It serves as an authoritative guide, presenting a clear technical roadmap for understanding current developments and future trends, and offering valuable references for real-world implementation.
