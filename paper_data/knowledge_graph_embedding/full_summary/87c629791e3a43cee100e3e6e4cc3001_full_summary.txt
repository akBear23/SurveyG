INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Unlocking the full potential of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) hinges on robust Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models, particularly for critical tasks like link prediction. This comprehensive survey delves into the evolving landscape of KGEs from 2013-2022, offering a novel perspective that unifies the diverse family of **distance-based models**. We reveal the intrinsic connections underlying various **geometric transformations**—translation, rotation, scaling, reflection, and projection—demonstrating how frameworks like **CompoundE** and **CompoundE3D** can serve as unifying principles for many affine operation-based techniques. Beyond this foundational clarity, the survey meticulously contrasts distance-based and **semantic matching** models, and critically examines the burgeoning integration of KGEs with **pre-trained language models (PLMs)** and textual descriptions as a pivotal future direction for **KG completion**. By synthesizing a decade of research, identifying key trends, and proposing a unifying lens for geometric KGEs, this work provides an indispensable guide for researchers, illuminating paths for inventing novel models and advancing the frontier of KG completion.

FULL SUMMARY:
==================================================
Here is a focused summary of the survey paper by \cite{ge2023} for literature review:

1.  **Review Scope & Objectives**
    *   This survey provides a comprehensive overview of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models, primarily focusing on Knowledge Graph (KG) completion tasks like link prediction.
    *   Its main objectives are to analyze two core KGE design branches—distance-based and semantic matching-based methods—to uncover intrinsic connections and underlying trends, and to discuss the integration of KGE with pre-trained language models (PLMs).

2.  **Literature Coverage**
    *   The survey reviews KGE models published from 2013 to 2022, as evidenced by its timeline figure, and references 12 other survey papers from the same period.
    *   Literature inclusion focuses on models categorized as distance-based or semantic matching-based, along with emerging approaches leveraging neural networks and PLMs. The paper also compiles relevant resources such as open-source KGs, benchmarking datasets, and performance leaderboards.

3.  **Classification Framework**
    *   The survey primarily categorizes KGE models into two major classes based on their scoring functions and interaction modeling: distance-based models and semantic matching-based models.
    *   It further discusses CompoundE and CompoundE3D as unifying frameworks for distance-based models that utilize affine operations, and also addresses neural network-based models and PLM-integrated approaches as emerging directions.

4.  **Key Findings & Insights**
    *   A significant trend identified is the combination of various geometric transformations (translation, rotation, scaling, reflection, projection) to enhance KGE model performance and capture complex relation patterns.
    *   The survey highlights the intrinsic connections between diverse distance-based models, proposing that CompoundE and CompoundE3D can unify many of these affine operation-based techniques.
    *   It contrasts distance-based models (modeling relations as transformations to minimize entity vector distance) with semantic matching models (measuring semantic scores via bilinear functions).
    *   An emerging consensus points towards the integration of KGE methods with pre-trained language models (PLMs) and textual descriptions as a promising direction for KG completion.

5.  **Research Gaps & Future Directions**
    *   The survey identifies a gap in existing literature regarding the intrinsic connections between different distance-based embedding models that utilize geometric transformations, which this paper aims to address.
    *   Recommended future research directions include exploring the underlying trend of combining geometric transformations to invent novel models, and further integrating KGE embedding methods with PLMs for enhanced KG completion.

6.  **Survey Contribution**
    *   This survey provides unique value by offering a perspective on the intrinsic connections and unifying principles among distance-based KGE models that employ geometric transformations.
    *   It is comprehensive in its overview of KGE models, benchmarking resources, and discussion of emerging trends, including the integration of KGE with PLMs.
