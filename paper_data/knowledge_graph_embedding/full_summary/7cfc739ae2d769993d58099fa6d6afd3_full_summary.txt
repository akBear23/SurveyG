INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The digital landscape has fundamentally transformed English Language Learning (ELL), moving beyond traditional paradigms. This comprehensive survey unravels the intricate, symbiotic evolution of ELL alongside the World Wide Web (WWW), meticulously tracing its journey from the static Web 1.0 to the dynamic, intelligent Web 3.0. Adopting a unique learner-centric perspective, we chronologically analyze how web technologies have propelled language acquisition from passive content consumption to interactive, collaborative, and truly learner-centered environments. The paper systematically categorizes and elucidates the diverse web-based tools, applications, and pedagogical trends that have empowered English language learners across these distinct web eras. By offering a conceptual and historical overview, this work illuminates the continuous technological advancements and pedagogical shifts that have shaped modern Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL). This survey provides an invaluable resource for researchers and educators, offering critical insights into how the web has consistently enhanced, redefined, and will continue to influence the future trajectory of digital language education.
