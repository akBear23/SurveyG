INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The proliferation of uncertain spatiotemporal data demands robust methods for multihop query modeling on incomplete fuzzy spatiotemporal knowledge graphs (KGs). Current embedding-based approaches often neglect KG uncertainty and spatiotemporal sensitivity, leading to critical information loss during path reasoning. We present a novel embedding-based multihop query model that fundamentally redefines reasoning on these complex KGs. Our innovation lies in utilizing *quaternions* to jointly embed spatiotemporal entities, representing relations as dynamic rotations. Crucially, we incorporate uncertainty directly into the model through a bias factor in the scoring function, enabling a powerful *relaxation embedding* approach. By exploiting the inherent *noncommutative compositional pattern* of quaternions, our model constructs significantly more accurate multihop paths. Evaluated on two fuzzy spatiotemporal KG datasets, our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in link prediction and path query answering. This work offers a robust, technically advanced framework for integrating complex spatiotemporal and fuzzy information, opening new avenues for uncertain and dynamic KG reasoning.
