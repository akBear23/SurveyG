INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The promise of Knowledge Graph (KG) embeddings is often constrained by the rigid architectures of existing models, which struggle to adapt to the rich diversity of real-world knowledge. Current KG embedding search methods are confined to single KG forms and fixed Graph Neural Network (GNN) message functions, limiting their adaptability and performance. We introduce a groundbreaking paradigm: a novel search space for GNN message functions that, for the first time, allows for the dynamic discovery of *both structures and operators*. This unified framework transcends previous limitations, seamlessly adapting to traditional KGs, n-ary relational data (NRD), and hyper-relational KGs (HKG). It empowers the automatic discovery of data-dependent message functions, significantly enhancing model flexibility and performance. Empirical validation across diverse benchmark datasets demonstrates that our searched functions achieve leading performance, proving their superior adaptability. This work represents a significant leap in automated machine learning for graph data, paving the way for more robust and high-performing KG representation learning by enabling models to truly learn from the data's inherent complexity.

Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for literature review:

*   **Research Problem & Motivation**
    *   The paper addresses the limitations of existing Knowledge Graph (KG) embedding model searching methods \cite{di2023}.
    *   Current KG searching methods are restricted to a single KG form (e.g., only KGs, not NRD or HKG) and can only search within a single type of embedding model \cite{di2023}.
    *   Existing message function designs in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) fix structures and operators, making them inflexible for handling diverse KG forms and datasets \cite{di2023}. This inflexibility hinders data adaptability and performance.

*   **Related Work & Positioning**
    *   Existing KG searching methods aim to find suitable embedding models for a given KG dataset \cite{di2023}.
    *   This work positions itself as an advancement by overcoming the limitations of these methods, which are restricted to a single KG form and a single type of embedding model \cite{di2023}.

*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**
    *   The core technical approach is to build a search space for the message function within Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) \cite{di2023}.
    *   The innovation lies in designing a novel message function space that allows *both structures and operators* to be searched \cite{di2023}. This contrasts with existing GNN message functions that fix these elements.

*   **Key Technical Contributions**
    *   **Novel Message Function Space:** Introduction of a flexible message function space that can adapt to different KG forms (KG, NRD, HKG) and specific datasets \cite{di2023}.
    *   **Unified Framework:** The proposed space is expressive enough to search for different types of embedding models, and can even instantiate existing message function designs and classic KG embedding models as special cases \cite{di2023}.
    *   **Data Adaptability:** The design enables the search for data-dependent message functions, promoting better adaptability and performance \cite{di2023}.

*   **Experimental Validation**
    *   Experiments were conducted on benchmark datasets for KGs, NRD (n-ary relational data), and HKGs (hyper-relational KGs) \cite{di2023}.
    *   **Key Results:** The empirically searched message functions were shown to be data-dependent and achieved leading performance across these diverse benchmark datasets \cite{di2023}.

*   **Limitations & Scope**
    *   The paper implicitly addresses the limitations of prior KG searching methods and fixed GNN message functions by proposing a more flexible alternative \cite{di2023}.
    *   The scope of applicability covers various KG forms: traditional KGs, n-ary relational data (NRD), and hyper-relational KGs (HKG) \cite{di2023}.

*   **Technical Significance**
    *   This work significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing a unified and flexible framework for searching GNN message functions that can adapt to diverse knowledge graph structures \cite{di2023}.
    *   It offers a path towards more adaptable and high-performing KG embedding models by enabling the discovery of data-specific message functions, potentially impacting future research in automated machine learning for graph data and robust KG representation learning \cite{di2023}.
