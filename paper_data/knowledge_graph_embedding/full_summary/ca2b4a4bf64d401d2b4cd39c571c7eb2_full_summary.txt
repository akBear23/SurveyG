INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Decades after its ambitious proposal, the Semantic Web continues to promise a profoundly more intelligent and interconnected digital world. This comprehensive survey meticulously charts its remarkable evolution since 1994, offering a critical synthesis of foundational research that defines its current state. We navigate the seminal contributions across core subject areas, including sophisticated **knowledge representation** paradigms, the intricate design of **multi-agent systems**, the development of robust **semantic web services**, and the critical challenges of **trust**. By curating and summarizing key papers from each domain, this work illuminates how these diverse fields have converged to shape the Semantic Web's landscape. This paper provides researchers with an invaluable, accessible roadmap through the field's complex trajectory, highlighting significant advancements and establishing a robust framework for understanding its present capabilities and future potential. It is an essential resource for anyone seeking to grasp the full scope and impact of this transformative paradigm.
