INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Unlocking the vast potential of medical data while rigorously safeguarding patient privacy presents a paramount challenge in modern healthcare. This comprehensive survey critically examines Federated Learning (FL) as a transformative paradigm addressing data silos and regulatory hurdles in medical research. We systematically analyze existing FL approaches, classifying them by architecture (horizontal, vertical, federated transfer learning), application domains (medical image analysis, drug discovery, clinical prediction), and crucial privacy-preserving mechanisms like differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, and secure multi-party computation.

Our findings illuminate the intricate trade-offs between model accuracy, privacy guarantees, and computational overhead inherent in various FL implementations. We highlight the growing imperative for robust solutions to data heterogeneity, model robustness, and adversarial attacks. This survey synthesizes the rapidly evolving landscape, identifying significant research gaps and charting a pivotal roadmap for future innovation, including interpretable and fair FL algorithms, novel privacy techniques, and practical deployment strategies. It serves as an indispensable reference for researchers navigating the complexities and immense promise of FL in healthcare.
