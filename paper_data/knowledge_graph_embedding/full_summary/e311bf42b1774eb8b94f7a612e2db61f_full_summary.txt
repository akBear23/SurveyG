INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The rapid evolution of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models is often hampered by a critical lack of reproducibility and the immense difficulty in conducting systematic, comprehensive experimental studies. Disentangling the true contributions of various model architectures, training methods, and evaluation strategies remains a significant challenge. We introduce LibKGE, an open-source, PyTorch-based framework designed to revolutionize KGE research for link prediction.

LibKGE ensures full experiment reproducibility through a single, highly configurable file, a groundbreaking feature for the field. Its modular architecture decouples components, enabling researchers to effortlessly mix-and-match models, training regimes, and evaluation metrics. Coupled with efficient implementations and comprehensive logging tools for in-depth analysis, LibKGE achieves competitive to state-of-the-art performance with minimal hyperparameter tuning. This framework not only standardizes KGE experimentation but also empowers researchers to accelerate model development and gain unprecedented insights into model behavior, fostering a new era of reliable and comparable KGE research.
