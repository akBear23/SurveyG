INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The scoring function, which measures the plausibility of triplets in knowledge graphs (KGs), is the key to ensure the excellent performance of KG embedding, and its design is also an important problem in the literature. Automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques have recently been introduced into KG to design task-aware scoring functions, which achieve the state-of-the-art performance in KG embedding. However, the effectiveness of searched scoring functions is still not as good as desired. In this paper, observing that existing scoring functions can exhibit distinct performance on different semantic patterns, we are motivated to explore such semantics by searching relationa-ware scoring functions. But the relation-aware search requires a much larger search space than the previous one. Hence, we propose to encode the space as a supernet and propose an efficient alternative minimization algorithm to search through the supernet in a one-shot manner. Finally, experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently search relation-aware scoring functions, and achieve better embedding performance than state-of-the-art methods.1
