INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The growing number of publications in the field of artificial intelligence highlights the need for researchers to enhance their efficiency in searching for relevant articles. Most paper recommendation models either rely on simplistic citation relationships among papers or focus on content-based approaches, both of which overlook interactions within academic networks. To address the aforementioned problem, knowledge graph embedding (KGE) methods have been used for citation recommendations because recent research proves that graph representations can effectively improve recommendation model accuracy. However, academic networks are dynamic, leading to changes in the representations of users and items over time. The majority of KGE-based citation recommendations are primarily designed for static graphs, thus failing to capture the evolution of dynamic knowledge graph (DKG) structures. To address these challenges, we introduced the evolving knowledge graph embedding (EKGE) method. In this methodology, evolving knowledge graphs are input into time-series models to learn the patterns of structural evolution. The model has the capability to generate embeddings for each entity at various time points, thereby overcoming limitation of static models that require retraining to acquire embeddings at each specific time point. To enhance the efficiency of feature extraction, we employed a multiple attention strategy. This helped the model find recommendation lists that are closely related to a user’s needs, leading to improved recommendation accuracy. Various experiments conducted on a citation recommendation dataset revealed that the EKGE model exhibits a 1.13% increase in prediction accuracy compared to other KGE methods. Moreover, the model’s accuracy can be further increased by an additional 0.84% through the incorporation of an attention mechanism.
