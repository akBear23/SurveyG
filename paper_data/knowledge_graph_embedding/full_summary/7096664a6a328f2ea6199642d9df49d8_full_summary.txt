INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Natural disasters pose escalating global challenges, demanding innovative solutions. This paper presents the *first systematic review* of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural disaster management, unveiling their unprecedented potential across all four critical phases: Mitigation, Preparedness, Response, and Recovery. We introduce a novel, comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes LLM applications by disaster phase, scenario, specific tasks (e.g., classification, generation), and underlying model architectures (encoder-based, (encoder-)decoder, multimodal LLMs). Our analysis reveals how diverse LLM capabilities, from vulnerability assessment to real-time information coordination, are leveraged. We highlight the pivotal role of techniques like fine-tuning, prompting, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in tailoring LLMs for disaster-specific contexts. A key finding is the transformative impact of multimodal LLMs, integrating diverse data sources to enhance predictive accuracy and situational assessment. This survey provides a holistic understanding of the field, identifies critical research gaps, and charts future directions, serving as an authoritative guide for researchers and practitioners dedicated to strengthening disaster resilience through advanced AI.

FULL SUMMARY:
==================================================
Here is a focused summary of the survey paper "Harnessing Large Language Models for Disaster Management: A Survey" by Lei et al., tailored for a literature review:

1.  **Review Scope & Objectives**
    This survey comprehensively analyzes the emerging role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural disaster management \cite{lei2025}. Its main objectives are to address the lack of systematic reviews in this domain, provide an in-depth analysis of LLM applications, and offer valuable insights for researchers and practitioners developing LLM-driven solutions to enhance disaster resilience \cite{lei2025}.

2.  **Literature Coverage**
    The paper reviews existing works on LLM applications in disaster management, covering a range of studies that explore their use across different disaster phases and application scenarios \cite{lei2025}. While a specific time period for reviewed papers is not explicitly stated, the survey focuses on "increasing research" and "emerging role" of LLMs, implying a focus on recent advancements \cite{lei2025}. The methodology involves categorizing these works based on disaster phases, application scenarios, and model architectures.

3.  **Classification Framework**
    *   The survey organizes the literature using a novel taxonomy that integrates disaster phases, application scenarios, specific tasks, and model architectures \cite{lei2025}.
    *   It categorizes LLM applications across the four key disaster management phases: Mitigation, Preparedness, Response, and Recovery \cite{lei2025}.
    *   Literature is further classified by three main LLM architectures: encoder-based LLMs, (encoder-)decoder LLMs, and multimodal LLMs, and by specific tasks such as classification, estimation, extraction, and generation \cite{lei2025}.

4.  **Key Findings & Insights**
    *   LLMs demonstrate remarkable capabilities across all four disaster phases, from vulnerability assessment in mitigation to real-time information coordination in response and recovery planning \cite{lei2025}.
    *   Different LLM architectures are leveraged for distinct tasks: encoder-based LLMs excel in contextual understanding and classification, (encoder-)decoder LLMs are optimized for sequential prediction and generation, and multimodal LLMs integrate diverse data for enhanced prediction and situational assessment \cite{lei2025}.
    *   Common techniques like fine-tuning, prompting, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are widely employed to tailor LLMs for disaster-specific tasks, often improving knowledge integration and responsiveness \cite{lei2025}.
    *   The integration of multimodal data (e.g., satellite imagery, social media images) with LLMs is a significant trend, addressing the limitations of text-only data and enhancing predictive accuracy and descriptive capabilities \cite{lei2025}.

5.  **Research Gaps & Future Directions**
    The survey identifies a critical gap in the lack of systematic reviews of LLMs in disaster management, which it aims to fill \cite{lei2025}. It highlights challenges such as limitations of textual data, multimodal heterogeneity, and label scarcity in training data \cite{lei2025}. Future research directions include enhancing the effectiveness, efficiency, and trustworthiness of LLMs in disaster response, and developing advanced LLM-driven solutions and frameworks to strengthen resilience against natural disasters \cite{lei2025}.

6.  **Survey Contribution**
    This paper provides the first systematic review of LLM applications in disaster management across all four phases, offering a unique and comprehensive overview of the field \cite{lei2025}. Its novel taxonomy, compilation of public datasets, and identification of key challenges and opportunities make it an authoritative guide for AI researchers, policymakers, and practitioners \cite{lei2025}.
