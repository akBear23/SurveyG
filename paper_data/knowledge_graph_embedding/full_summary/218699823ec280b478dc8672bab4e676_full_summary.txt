INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Effectively modeling **Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE)** requires simultaneously capturing diverse **relation patterns** (e.g., symmetry, composition) and complex **relation mapping properties (RMPs)** like 1-to-N. Current models often fall short, limited by fixed low-dimensional spaces or an inability to reconcile these conflicting demands.

We introduce **HousE**, a novel KGE framework leveraging **Householder parameterization** to overcome these limitations. HousE pioneers **high-dimensional Householder rotations**, generalizing previous rotation-based models to arbitrary *k*-dimensional spaces, profoundly enhancing modeling capacity for intricate relation patterns.

Crucially, HousE introduces **invertible Householder projections** that flexibly adjust relative distances to model sophisticated RMPs, a limitation of prior models. This unified framework is the first to simultaneously and effectively capture *all* critical relation patterns and RMPs, overcoming inherent KGE trade-offs.

Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments confirm HousE's comprehensive modeling and practical superiority. HousE achieves new **state-of-the-art** performance on benchmark **link prediction** tasks, significantly outperforming strong baselines. This work offers a powerful new paradigm for KGE, paving the way for more robust and expressive knowledge representation.

### HousE: Knowledge Graph Embedding with Householder Parameterization \cite{li2022}

1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**
    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Existing Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models struggle to simultaneously and effectively model the diverse intrinsic relation patterns (e.g., symmetry, antisymmetry, inversion, composition) and complex relation mapping properties (RMPs, e.g., 1-to-N, N-to-1, N-to-N). Many models have insufficient modeling capacity, often restricted to low-dimensional spaces.
    *   **Importance & Challenge**: KGE is crucial for predicting missing links in incomplete real-world KGs. Accurately capturing these varied relation characteristics is fundamental for learning robust and informative entity and relation representations, but it's challenging because different properties often require conflicting mathematical operations (e.g., distance-preserving rotations for patterns vs. distance-adjusting projections for RMPs).

2.  **Related Work & Positioning**
    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: This work builds upon and generalizes rotation-based KGE models like RotatE, Rotate3D, and QuatE, which represent relations as rotations in 2D, 3D, and 4D spaces, respectively. It also relates to projection-based models like TransH, TransR, and TransD.
    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:
        *   **TransE and its variants (TransX)**: Fail to model symmetry and RMPs effectively.
        *   **DistMult, ComplEx**: Can model some patterns but not all (e.g., DistMult struggles with antisymmetry, ComplEx with composition).
        *   **Rotation-based models (RotatE, Rotate3D, QuatE, DualE)**: While effective at modeling relation patterns (symmetry, antisymmetry, inversion, composition), they are inherently distance-preserving, making them incapable of handling sophisticated RMPs (1-to-N, N-to-1, N-to-N) where relative distances need to change.
        *   **Dimensionality Constraint**: Many advanced rotation-based approaches are specifically designed for fixed, low-dimensional spaces (2D, 3D, 4D), which may be inadequate for capturing the complex structures of large KGs.
        *   **Projection-based models**: Existing projection methods are often irreversible, leading to failures in modeling inversion and composition patterns.

3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**
    *   **Core Technical Method**: HousE introduces a novel parameterization based on two types of Householder transformations:
        1.  **Householder Rotations**: Relations are modeled as high-dimensional rotations (k-dimensional, where k can be >4) using compositions of Householder reflections. This forms the basis of `HousE-r`.
        2.  **Householder Projections**: To address RMPs, `HousE` modifies vanilla Householder reflections into "Householder projections." These are invertible transformations that can flexibly adjust the relative distances between points.
    *   **Novelty/Differentiation**:
        *   **Unified Framework**: HousE is the first to combine high-dimensional rotations and invertible projections within a single framework to simultaneously model all crucial relation patterns and RMPs.
        *   **High-Dimensional Rotations**: It leverages a theoretical proof that any k-dimensional rotation can be represented as a composition of `2 * floor(k/2)` Householder reflections, allowing for rotations in arbitrary high-dimensional spaces, unlike previous fixed-low-dimensional approaches.
        *   **Invertible Projections**: The proposed Householder projections are invertible, which is crucial for maintaining the ability to model inversion and composition patterns, a limitation of prior projection-based methods.
        *   **Generalization**: HousE is a generalization of existing rotation-based models (RotatE, Rotate3D, QuatE) by extending rotations to k-dimensional spaces.
        *   **Efficient Computation**: Matrix-vector multiplications for Householder transformations are optimized into vector operations, reducing time complexity from O(2nk^2) to O(2nk) for rotations and similar for projections.

4.  **Key Technical Contributions**
    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**:
        *   Introduction of **Householder parameterization** for KGE, utilizing Householder reflections and projections.
        *   **HousE-r**: A model for high-dimensional (k-dimensional) relational rotations based on compositions of Householder reflections, theoretically capable of modeling symmetry, antisymmetry, inversion, and composition.
        *   **Householder Projections**: A novel type of invertible projection, derived from modified Householder matrices, designed to flexibly adjust distances and handle RMPs without sacrificing pattern modeling.
        *   **HousE**: A unified framework combining Householder rotations and Householder projections to model all relation patterns and RMPs simultaneously.
    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**:
        *   Proof that any k-dimensional rotation can be represented as `2 * floor(k/2)` Householder reflections (Theorem 3.1).
        *   Theoretical claims demonstrating HousE's capability to model symmetry, antisymmetry, inversion, composition, and RMPs (Claims 3.2-3.5).
        *   Analysis of the invertibility of Householder projections.

5.  **Experimental Validation**
    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Link prediction tasks.
    *   **Key Performance Metrics**: Mean Rank (MR), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Hits@1 (H@1), Hits@3 (H@3), Hits@10 (H@10).
    *   **Comparison Results**: HousE consistently achieves new state-of-the-art performance across five benchmark datasets, including WN18 and FB15k, outperforming strong baselines like TransE, DistMult, ComplEx, ConvE, RotatE, Rotate3D, and QuatE. For example, on WN18, HousE achieves MRR of 0.952 and H@10 of 0.962, surpassing RotatE (0.949 MRR, 0.959 H@10) and QuatE (0.949 MRR, 0.959 H@10). On FB15k, HousE achieves MRR of 0.801 and H@10 of 0.889, outperforming RotatE (0.797 MRR, 0.884 H@10).

6.  **Limitations & Scope**
    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**:
        *   While HousE-r (pure Householder rotations) initially suffered from the limitation of not being able to model RMPs due to its distance-preserving nature, the full HousE framework explicitly addresses and overcomes this by integrating Householder projections.
        *   The paper does not explicitly state new limitations of the *final* HousE model, but rather positions it as a comprehensive solution to previous limitations.
    *   **Scope of Applicability**: Primarily focused on knowledge graph embedding for link prediction tasks. The framework's generalizability to other KG-related tasks (e.g., KG completion, entity classification) is implied but not explicitly demonstrated beyond link prediction.

7.  **Technical Significance**
    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: HousE significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in KGE by providing a powerful and general framework capable of simultaneously modeling all crucial relation patterns and RMPs, a challenge that previous models could only partially address. Its ability to perform high-dimensional rotations offers superior modeling capacity.
    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:
        *   Provides a new paradigm for KGE by leveraging Householder parameterization, potentially inspiring further research into geometric transformations for representation learning.
        *   The generalization of rotation-based models to arbitrary high dimensions opens avenues for exploring optimal embedding dimensions for different KGs.
        *   The concept of invertible projections for RMPs could be adapted to other domains requiring flexible distance adjustments while preserving structural properties.
        *   The theoretical proofs and efficient computation methods contribute to a deeper understanding and practical application of advanced linear algebra in machine learning.
