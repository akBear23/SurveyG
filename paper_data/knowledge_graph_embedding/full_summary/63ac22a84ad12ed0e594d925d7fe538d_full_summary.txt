INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The purpose of representation learning is to encode the entities and relations in a knowledge graph as low-dimensional and real-valued vectors through machine learning technology. Traditional representation learning methods like TransE, a method which models relationships by interpreting them as translations operating on the low-dimensional embeddings of a graph’s entities, are effective for learning the embeddings of knowledge bases, but struggle to effectively model complex relations like one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many. To overcome the above issues, we introduce a new method for knowledge representation, reasoning, and completion based on multi-translation principles and TransE (TransE-MTP). By defining multiple translation principles (MTPs) for different relation types, such as one-to-one and complex relations like one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many, and combining MTPs with a typical translating-based model for modeling multi-relational data (TransE), the proposed method, TransE-MTP, ensures that multiple optimization objectives can be targeted and optimized during training on complex relations, thereby providing superior prediction performance. We implement a prototype of TransE-MTP to demonstrate its effectiveness at link prediction and triplet classification on two prominent knowledge graph datasets: Freebase and Wordnet. Our experimental results show that the proposed method enhanced the performance of both TransE and knowledge graph embedding by translating on hyperplanes (TransH), which confirms its effectiveness and competitiveness.
