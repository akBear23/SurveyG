INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The frontier of robotic intelligence is increasingly defined by its ability to perceive and reason across diverse sensory inputs, moving beyond unimodal limitations. This comprehensive survey presents a critical, task-oriented review of **multimodal fusion techniques** and the transformative impact of **vision-language models (VLMs)** in **robot vision**. We systematically categorize fusion strategies—from **early, mid, and late fusion** to **attention-based architectures** and **graph neural networks**—and offer an unprecedented comparative analysis, bridging traditional methods with cutting-edge **LLM-based VLMs**.

Our work illuminates how these approaches fundamentally enhance **semantic scene understanding, 3D object detection, SLAM, navigation, and manipulation**, significantly boosting perceptual robustness, semantic expressiveness, and high-level reasoning. We detail architectural characteristics and practical implementations, highlighting the unique potential of VLMs for **zero-shot understanding** and **instruction following**. Crucially, we identify key challenges in **cross-modal alignment** and real-time deployment, charting future directions in **self-supervised learning** and **structured spatial memory**. This survey serves as an indispensable roadmap, accelerating the development of truly intelligent and adaptable robotic systems.
