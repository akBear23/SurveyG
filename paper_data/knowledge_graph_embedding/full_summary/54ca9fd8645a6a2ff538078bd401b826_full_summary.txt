INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
TorchKGE is a Python module for knowledge graph (KG) embedding relying solely on PyTorch. This package provides researchers and engineers with a clean and efficient API to design and test new models. It features a KG data structure, simple model interfaces and modules for negative sampling and model evaluation. Its main strength is a very fast evaluation module for the link prediction task, a central application of KG embedding. Various KG embedding models are also already implemented. Special attention has been paid to code efficiency and simplicity, documentation and API consistency. It is distributed using PyPI under BSD license. Source code and pointers to documentation and deployment can be found at this https URL.
