INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
As customer expectations soar, intelligent Customer Relationship Management (CRM) becomes critical. Semantic Web technologies offer a transformative paradigm, promising deeper customer understanding and hyper-personalized interactions. This systematic literature review meticulously synthesizes findings from 44 scientific publications, exploring the burgeoning intersection of Semantic Web and CRM.

We reveal a significant and growing research interest, confirming the practical advantages of applying **semantic models** to enhance diverse CRM activities. Our analysis highlights novel approaches supporting **customized products and services, proactive user support, integrated offerings, and efficient complaint management** through sophisticated **knowledge representation** and **data integration**. This comprehensive survey not only familiarizes researchers and practitioners with existing advancements but also illuminates critical trends and future research directions. It serves as an indispensable resource for scientists, software engineers, and data analysts seeking to leverage the power of the Semantic Web to revolutionize customer engagement.
