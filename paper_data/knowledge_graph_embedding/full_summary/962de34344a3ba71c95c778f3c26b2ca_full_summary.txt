INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Unlocking actionable insights from the intricate landscape of high-dimensional spatial transcriptomics data remains a formidable challenge, yet it is pivotal for deciphering disease mechanisms and accelerating drug discovery. Traditional methods often falter in capturing the nuanced spatial relationships critical for identifying robust therapeutic targets. We introduce a novel computational framework that revolutionizes this process by seamlessly integrating spatial transcriptomics with cutting-edge computer vision techniques. Our approach leverages deep learning-based segmentation to precisely delineate tissue structures and employs graph neural networks (GNNs) to model complex cellular interactions and spatial dependencies with unprecedented fidelity. This innovative methodological integration significantly enhances data interpretability, enabling the identification of disease-specific biomarkers with superior accuracy. Validated on benchmark datasets, our framework demonstrates significant improvements over conventional approaches, promising to accelerate the discovery of therapeutic targets and usher in a new era for precision medicine and computational biology.
