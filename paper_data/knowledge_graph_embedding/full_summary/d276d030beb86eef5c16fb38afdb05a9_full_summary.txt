INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has introduced unprecedented vulnerabilities, making them prime targets for devastating cyberattacks. While machine learning offers promising avenues for **anomaly detection**, existing solutions often compromise data privacy and struggle with accurately modeling the benign class, crucial for effective **intrusion detection**. We introduce FeCo, a novel **federated-contrastive-learning framework** designed for collaborative, in-network intrusion detection in IoT.

FeCo uniquely integrates **federated learning** to ensure **privacy-preserving** model training by sharing only model parameters, not raw data. Its core innovation lies in a **novel contrastive learning method** specifically tailored to learn a highly accurate **representation** of the benign class, significantly boosting detection performance. Furthermore, a **two-step feature selection scheme** optimizes efficiency and prevents overfitting. Validated on NSL-KDD and BaIoT datasets, FeCo achieves up to an 8% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates remarkable robustness to **non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data**. Implemented on **resource-constrained IoT devices** like Raspberry Pi, FeCo offers a robust, accurate, and privacy-aware solution, fundamentally advancing the security of IoT ecosystems and paving the way for secure, distributed AI.
