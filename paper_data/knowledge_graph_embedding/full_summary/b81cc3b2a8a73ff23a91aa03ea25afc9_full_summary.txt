INTRIGUING ABSTRACT:
==================================================
Current speech-to-speech (S2S) benchmarks critically overlook the nuanced evaluation of *paralinguistic information* in both speech input and output, hindering the development of truly natural human-computer interaction. We introduce S2S-Arena, a pioneering benchmark designed to rigorously assess S2S models' instruction-following capabilities, explicitly integrating paralinguistic understanding and generation.

Our novel approach features a unique four-level difficulty hierarchy (L0-L3) that systematically targets paralinguistic complexity, alongside a diverse dataset of 154 multi-domain samples. Crucially, S2S-Arena employs a robust, human-centric, arena-style pairwise comparison with ELO ranking, overcoming the limitations of unreliable automatic metrics. Experimental validation reveals that while models like GPT-4o excel, generating accurate paralinguistic speech output remains a significant challenge, even for advanced systems. This benchmark provides unprecedented insights into S2S model performance, guiding future research towards more sophisticated multimodal integration and truly expressive speech generation, thereby setting a new standard for S2S evaluation.

FULL SUMMARY:
==================================================
Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review, emphasizing technical innovations and empirical validation:

---

*   **1. Research Problem & Motivation**
    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** Existing benchmarks for speech-to-speech (S2S) models primarily rely on automatic text-based evaluators, which fail to adequately assess the models' instruction-following ability when considering *paralinguistic information* in both speech input (understanding) and speech output (generation).
    *   **Importance and Challenge:** Paralinguistic information (e.g., emotion, speaking style, rhythm, tone) is crucial for natural and vivid human-computer interaction in S2S protocols. Evaluating this complex, multimodal aspect is challenging because current automatic text-based metrics lose vital speech modality information, and automatic speech-based metrics are often unreliable and biased.

*   **2. Related Work & Positioning**
    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** Previous benchmarks for speech models fall into categories such as foundation task completion (speech understanding, text output) or speech-based chat (may consider speech input paralinguistics, but still text output). Some, like AIR-Bench, consider paralinguistics in speech input but not in speech output.
    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**
        *   Lack of comprehensive consideration for paralinguistic information in *speech output*.
        *   Inconsistent evaluation modalities (e.g., speech input, text output), leading to a loss of crucial speech-specific information.
        *   Reliance on unreliable automatic metrics (both text-based and speech-based) that do not accurately capture the nuances of paralinguistic performance.
    *   **Positioning:** S2S-Arena \cite{jiang2025} directly addresses these limitations by introducing a benchmark that explicitly evaluates instruction-following with paralinguistic information in *both* speech-in and speech-out, utilizing a human-centric, arena-style evaluation in the speech modality.

*   **3. Technical Approach & Innovation**
    *   **Core Technical Method:** S2S-Arena \cite{jiang2025} is a novel arena-style benchmark designed to evaluate S2S models' instruction-following capabilities, specifically incorporating paralinguistic information in both speech understanding and generation.
    *   **Three-Stage Construction Process:**
        *   **Task Determination:** Identified 21 fine-grained tasks across four practical domains (Education, Social Interaction, Entertainment, Medical Consultation) relevant to real-world S2S usage.
        *   **Instruction Design:** Developed a unique four-level difficulty hierarchy (L0-L3) for samples, systematically considering the presence and requirement of paralinguistic information in speech input and/or speech output. L3 represents the highest difficulty, requiring both paralinguistic understanding and generation.
        *   **Instruction Recording:** Created 154 diverse samples by fusing Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis (for easier tasks) and manual human recordings (for complex tasks like sarcasm detection or singing). Robustness was enhanced by using different vocal tones and adding eight types of background noise.
    *   **Evaluation Methodology:** Adopted a manual, arena-style pairwise comparison approach with ELO ranking, where human evaluators directly compare two speech outputs from different models based on both semantic correctness and speech quality, including paralinguistic adherence. This avoids the pitfalls of automatic metrics.
    *   **Novelty:**
        *   First benchmark to systematically and comprehensively evaluate instruction-following with paralinguistic information in *both* speech input and speech output for S2S protocols.
        *   Introduction of a structured, multi-level difficulty design (L0-L3) that explicitly targets paralinguistic understanding and generation.
        *   Pioneering the use of a robust, human-centric, arena-style evaluation in the speech modality to overcome the limitations of existing automatic evaluation methods.

*   **4. Key Technical Contributions**
    *   **Novel Benchmark Design:** Introduction of S2S-Arena \cite{jiang2025}, a pioneering arena-style benchmark for S2S models that specifically targets instruction-following with paralinguistic information in both speech input and output.
    *   **Multi-level Paralinguistic Instruction Design:** A unique four-level difficulty framework (L0-L3) that systematically integrates paralinguistic requirements for both speech understanding and generation, enabling fine-grained assessment.
    *   **Diverse and Robust Sample Dataset:** Creation of 154 high-quality, multi-domain samples (TTS and manual recordings) with varied acoustic conditions (vocal tones, background noises) to ensure comprehensive and challenging evaluation.
    *   **Human-Centric Evaluation Protocol:** Development and implementation of a manual arena-style pairwise comparison with ELO ranking, providing a more reliable and direct assessment of S2S model performance in the speech modality, especially for paralinguistic aspects.

*   **5. Experimental Validation**
    *   **Experiments Conducted:** Manual arena-style pairwise comparisons were performed on several popular S2S models, including GPT-4o-realtime, FunAudioLLM (a cascaded ASR+LLM+TTS model), and a variant of FunAudioLLM using GPT-4o as its LLM backbone (FunAudioLLM (4o)). A total of 400 evaluations were conducted by 22 human evaluators.
    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results:**
        *   GPT-4o demonstrated superior overall performance.
        *   Cascaded ASR, LLM, and TTS models (e.g., FunAudioLLM (4o)) generally outperformed jointly trained models after text-speech alignment in S2S protocols.
        *   The knowledgeability of speech models, particularly concerning paralinguistic information, was found to primarily depend on the underlying LLM backbone.
        *   Multilingual support in speech models was identified as being limited by the capabilities of the speech module itself.
        *   While excellent speech models can understand paralinguistic information in speech input, generating appropriate audio with accurate paralinguistic information remains a significant challenge.

*   **6. Limitations & Scope**
    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The necessity of manual human evaluation highlights the current technical limitation in developing reliable automatic metrics for paralinguistic speech assessment. The observed dependency of knowledgeability on the LLM backbone and multilingual support on the speech module points to architectural limitations in current S2S models. The difficulty in generating paralinguistic speech output indicates a frontier for future research.
    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The benchmark focuses on instruction-following in S2S protocols across four practical domains (Education, Social Interaction, Entertainment, Medical Consultation) and 21 specific tasks. The sample collection and quality control primarily involved English and Chinese languages.

*   **7. Technical Significance**
    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** S2S-Arena \cite{jiang2025} significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by providing the first comprehensive and rigorous benchmark for evaluating S2S models' instruction-following capabilities with explicit consideration of paralinguistic information in both input and output speech. This moves beyond semantic-only or text-based evaluations, offering a more holistic assessment.
    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:**
        *   **Guides Model Development:** The findings provide crucial insights, indicating that future S2S model designs must prioritize improved multimodal integration, enhanced multilingual support, and more sophisticated paralinguistic speech generation capabilities.
        *   **Standardizes Evaluation:** The proposed human-centric, arena-style evaluation methodology offers a robust standard for assessing the naturalness, fidelity, and instruction-following ability of advanced S2S systems.
        *   **Identifies Research Gaps:** The benchmark's results clearly delineate current strengths (e.g., cascaded models, LLM backbone for knowledge) and weaknesses (e.g., paralinguistic generation, multilingual speech modules), thereby directing future research efforts.
        *   **Informs Bias Understanding:** The discussion of unique biases in speech model evaluations contributes to a more nuanced and informed approach to S2S system assessment.
