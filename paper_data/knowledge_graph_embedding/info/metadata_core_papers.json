        "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models represent the entities and relations of a knowledge graph (KG) using dense continuous representations called embeddings. KGE methods have recently gained traction for tasks such as knowledge graph completion and reasoning as well as to provide suitable entity representations for downstream learning tasks. While a large part of the available literature focuses on small KGs, a number of frameworks that are able to train KGE models for large-scale KGs by parallelization across multiple GPUs or machines have recently been proposed. So far, the benefits and drawbacks of the various parallelization techniques have not been studied comprehensively. In this paper, we report on an experimental study in which we presented, re-implemented in a common computational framework, investigated, and improved the available techniques. We found that the evaluation methodologies used in prior work are often not comparable and can be misleading, and that most of currently implemented training methods tend to have a negative impact on embedding quality. We propose a simple but effective variation of the stratification technique used by PyTorch BigGraph for mitigation. Moreover, basic random partitioning can be an effective or even the best-performing choice when combined with suitable sampling techniques. Ultimately, we found that efficient and effective parallel training of large-scale KGE models is indeed achievable but requires a careful choice of techniques.",

Finding the new purpose of an approved or investigational drug, known as drug repurposing, has become increasingly popular in recent years. We propose here a new drug repurposing approach for COVID-19, based on knowledge graph (KG) embeddings. Our approach learns \u201censemble embeddings\u201d of entities and relations in a COVID-19 centric KG, in order to get a better latent representation of the graph elements. Ensemble KG-embeddings are subsequently used in a deep neural network trained for discovering potential drugs for COVID-19. Compared to related works, we retrieve more in-trial drugs among our top-ranked predictions, thus giving greater confidence in our prediction for out-of-trial drugs. For the first time to our knowledge, molecular docking is then used to evaluate the predictions obtained from drug repurposing using KG embedding. We show that Fosinopril is a potential ligand for the SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 target. We also provide explanations of our predictions thanks to rules extracted from the KG and instanciated by KG-derived explanatory paths. Molecular evaluation and explanatory paths bring reliability to our results and constitute new complementary and reusable methods for assessing KG-based drug repurposing.",

Existing virtual screening methods (e.g., molecular docking) suffer from high false positive rates, and current Knowledge Graph (KG)-based drug repurposing approaches often rely on single embedding models and lack robust validation beyond in-trial drug matching.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge:** Drug repurposing offers a faster, more cost-effective alternative. The challenge lies in accurately predicting novel drug-disease associations from complex biological data, reducing false positives, and providing reliable, explainable predictions to build confidence in out-of-trial candidates.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** This work builds upon existing KG embedding methods for drug repurposing, which formulate the task as link prediction (e.g., (Compound, Treat, Disease) triples) on COVID-19 centric KGs like DRKG.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n        *   Most studies depend on a *single KG embedding model*, which may not effectively capture the diverse types of relations within a complex biological KG \\cite{islam2023}.\n        *   Existing approaches primarily *assess predictions only against in-trial drugs*, lacking molecular-level validation (e.g., docking or structural similarity) for predicted compounds \\cite{islam2023}.\n        *   *KG-derived explanations for predictions are largely missing*, making it difficult to understand the rationale behind the recommendations and hindering reliability \\cite{islam2023}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper proposes an integrated pipeline for COVID-19 drug repurposing, evaluation, and explanation.\n        *   **Ensemble KG Embedding:** It generates \"ensemble embeddings\" by combining multiple complementary traditional KG embedding methods (TransE, TransH, DistMult) and then reducing their dimensionality using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) \\cite{islam2023}.

        "abstract": "Predicting missing links between entities in a knowledge graph is a fundamental task to deal with the incompleteness of data on the Web. Knowledge graph embeddings map nodes into a vector space to predict new links, scoring them according to geometric criteria. Relations in the graph may follow patterns that can be learned, e.g., some relations might be symmetric and others might be hierarchical. However, the learning capability of different embedding models varies for each pattern and, so far, no single model can learn all patterns equally well. In this paper, we combine the query representations from several models in a unified one to incorporate patterns that are independently captured by each model. Our combination uses attention to select the most suitable model to answer each query. The models are also mapped onto a non-Euclidean manifold, the Poincar\u00e9 ball, to capture structural patterns, such as hierarchies, besides relational patterns, such as symmetry. We prove that our combination provides a higher expressiveness and inference power than each model on its own. As a result, the combined model can learn relational and structural patterns. We conduct extensive experimental analysis with various link prediction benchmarks showing that the combined model outperforms individual models, including state-of-the-art approaches.",

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** Existing Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models struggle to learn and express the full spectrum of relational (e.g., symmetry, antisymmetry, inversion, composition) and structural (e.g., hierarchies) patterns present in knowledge graphs. No single KGE model performs equally well across all pattern types \\cite{gregucci2023}.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** Knowledge graphs are inherently incomplete, making link prediction a fundamental task. The challenge lies in developing a unified approach that can leverage the diverse strengths of different KGE models to capture a broader range of patterns, thereby improving the accuracy of predicting missing links \\cite{gregucci2023}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** The paper positions itself against individual KGE models (e.g., TransE, RotatE, ComplEx, DistMult, AttH/AttE) by aiming to combine their strengths rather than proposing a new standalone model \\cite{gregucci2023}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n        *   Prior KGE ensemble methods either combine multiple runs of the *same* model (still limited in pattern coverage) or combine *different* models at the score level (e.g., score concatenation, weighted sums, relation-level ensembles) \\cite{gregucci2023}. These methods lack a fine-grained mechanism to dynamically select the most suitable model's representation for a specific query.\n        *   Approaches like MulDE, while combining models, cannot steer decisions towards the specific strengths of individual models but rely on majority guidance \\cite{gregucci2023}.\n        *   Other research combines different *geometric spaces* (e.g., Hyperbolic, Spherical, Euclidean) but does not focus on combining *query representations* from different KGE models \\cite{gregucci2023}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper proposes a general framework that integrates query representations from multiple existing KGE models (M) into a unified representation. This combination is achieved through a spherical geometric framework \\cite{gregucci2023}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:**\n        *   **Attention Mechanism for Query Combination:** A key innovation is the use of an attention mechanism to dynamically select the \"most suitable model to answer each query\" based on the characteristics of the underlying relation \\cite{gregucci2023}. This allows the framework to adapt to different relational patterns.\n        *   **Multi-Geometric Space Integration:** The model combines query representations in Euclidean space and then projects them onto a non-Euclidean manifold, specifically the Poincar\u00e9 ball, to effectively capture structural patterns like hierarchies, in addition to relational patterns \\cite{gregucci2023}.\n        *   **Spherical Query Embedding:** Each query is represented as a hypersphere, where the center is the combined query embedding and the radius is linked to ranking metrics (Hits@k) and optimized via a loss function \\cite{gregucci2023}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Framework:** A spherical geometric framework for integrating diverse KGE models by combining their query representations, leveraging their distinct geometric transformations \\cite{gregucci2023}.\n    *   **Adaptive Attention Mechanism:** Introduction of a Riemannian attention-based mechanism that learns to weigh the contributions of different KGE models' query representations based on the specific query's relation, enabling robust handling of heterogeneous relational patterns \\cite{gregucci2023}.\n    *   **Hybrid Geometry for Pattern Learning:** The integration of Euclidean space for query combination with projection onto the Poincar\u00e9 ball (hyperbolic geometry) to simultaneously capture both relational and structural (hierarchical) patterns \\cite{gregucci2023}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights:** Provides theoretical analyses demonstrating that the combined model offers higher expressiveness and inference power than individual models, and that the combined query embedding lies within the convex hull of individual model queries, ensuring it benefits from their collective strengths \\cite{gregucci2023}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** Extensive experimental analysis was conducted using various link prediction benchmarks \\cite{gregucci2023}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Results:** The combined model consistently \"outperforms individual models, including state-of-the-art approaches\" on these benchmarks \\cite{gregucci2023}. While specific datasets and detailed metrics are not in the provided abstract, the connection between the spherical radius and the Hits@k metric is highlighted, implying its use in evaluation \\cite{gregucci2023}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Assumptions:** The approach assumes that query representations from different models can be mapped to a common space (Euclidean for combination, then projected to hyperbolic) \\cite{gregucci2023}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The method is specifically designed for link prediction in knowledge graphs, focusing on combining query representations (h,r,?) to predict tail entities.\n    *   **Inherent Trade-off:** Theoretically, for a specific *k*, the combined model's score is bounded by the individual models, meaning it might not always achieve the *absolute best* score of a single, perfectly suited model, but it consistently outperforms the worst and provides a robust average \\cite{gregucci2023}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** The proposed model significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in link prediction by outperforming individual KGE models and existing ensemble approaches \\cite{gregucci2023}.\n    *   **Enhanced Pattern Learning Capability:** It provides a more comprehensive and adaptive framework for learning diverse relational and structural patterns in knowledge graphs, addressing a critical limitation of prior KGE models \\cite{gregucci2023}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:** The attention-based query combination and multi-geometric space integration offer a novel paradigm for combining heterogeneous models, potentially inspiring future research in adaptive model integration for various AI tasks beyond link prediction \\cite{gregucci2023}.",

Many models have insufficient modeling capacity, often restricted to low-dimensional spaces.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge**: KGE is crucial for predicting missing links in incomplete real-world KGs. Accurately capturing these varied relation characteristics is fundamental for learning robust and informative entity and relation representations, but it's challenging because different properties often require conflicting mathematical operations (e.g., distance-preserving rotations for patterns vs. distance-adjusting projections for RMPs).\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: This work builds upon and generalizes rotation-based KGE models like RotatE, Rotate3D, and QuatE, which represent relations as rotations in 2D, 3D, and 4D spaces, respectively. It also relates to projection-based models like TransH, TransR, and TransD.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   **TransE and its variants (TransX)**: Fail to model symmetry and RMPs effectively.\n        *   **DistMult, ComplEx**: Can model some patterns but not all (e.g., DistMult struggles with antisymmetry, ComplEx with composition).\n        *   **Rotation-based models (RotatE, Rotate3D, QuatE, DualE)**: While effective at modeling relation patterns (symmetry, antisymmetry, inversion, composition), they are inherently distance-preserving, making them incapable of handling sophisticated RMPs (1-to-N, N-to-1, N-to-N) where relative distances need to change.\n        *   **Dimensionality Constraint**: Many advanced rotation-based approaches are specifically designed for fixed, low-dimensional spaces (2D, 3D, 4D), which may be inadequate for capturing the complex structures of large KGs.\n        *   **Projection-based models**: Existing projection methods are often irreversible, leading to failures in modeling inversion and composition patterns.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: HousE introduces a novel parameterization based on two types of Householder transformations:\n        1.  **Householder Rotations**: Relations are modeled as high-dimensional rotations (k-dimensional, where k can be >4) using compositions of Householder reflections. This forms the basis of `HousE-r`.\n        2.  **Householder Projections**: To address RMPs, `HousE` modifies vanilla Householder reflections into \"Householder projections.\" These are invertible transformations that can flexibly adjust the relative distances between points.\n    *   **Novelty/Differentiation**:\n        *   **Unified Framework**: HousE is the first to combine high-dimensional rotations and invertible projections within a single framework to simultaneously model all crucial relation patterns and RMPs.\n        *   **High-Dimensional Rotations**: It leverages a theoretical proof that any k-dimensional rotation can be represented as a composition of `2 * floor(k/2)` Householder reflections, allowing for rotations in arbitrary high-dimensional spaces, unlike previous fixed-low-dimensional approaches.\n        *   **Invertible Projections**: The proposed Householder projections are invertible, which is crucial for maintaining the ability to model inversion and composition patterns, a limitation of prior projection-based methods.\n        *   **Generalization**: HousE is a generalization of existing rotation-based models (RotatE, Rotate3D, QuatE) by extending rotations to k-dimensional spaces.\n        *   **Efficient Computation**: Matrix-vector multiplications for Householder transformations are optimized into vector operations, reducing time complexity from O(2nk^2) to O(2nk) for rotations and similar for projections.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**:\n        *   Introduction of **Householder parameterization** for KGE, utilizing Householder reflections and projections.\n        *   **HousE-r**: A model for high-dimensional (k-dimensional) relational rotations based on compositions of Householder reflections, theoretically capable of modeling symmetry, antisymmetry, inversion, and composition.\n        *   **Householder Projections**: A novel type of invertible projection, derived from modified Householder matrices, designed to flexibly adjust distances and handle RMPs without sacrificing pattern modeling.\n        *   **HousE**: A unified framework combining Householder rotations and Householder projections to model all relation patterns and RMPs simultaneously.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**:\n        *   Proof that any k-dimensional rotation can be represented as `2 * floor(k/2)` Householder reflections (Theorem 3.1).\n        *   Theoretical claims demonstrating HousE's capability to model symmetry, antisymmetry, inversion, composition, and RMPs (Claims 3.2-3.5).\n        *   Analysis of the invertibility of Householder projections.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Link prediction tasks.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**: Mean Rank (MR), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Hits@1 (H@1), Hits@3 (H@3), Hits@10 (H@10).\n    *   **Comparison Results**: HousE consistently achieves new state-of-the-art performance across five benchmark datasets, including WN18 and FB15k, outperforming strong baselines like TransE, DistMult, ComplEx, ConvE, RotatE, Rotate3D, and QuatE. For example, on WN18, HousE achieves MRR of 0.952 and H@10 of 0.962, surpassing RotatE (0.949 MRR, 0.959 H@10) and QuatE (0.949 MRR, 0.959 H@10). On FB15k, HousE achieves MRR of 0.801 and H@10 of 0.889, outperforming RotatE (0.797 MRR, 0.884 H@10).\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**:\n        *   While HousE-r (pure Householder rotations) initially suffered from the limitation of not being able to model RMPs due to its distance-preserving nature, the full HousE framework explicitly addresses and overcomes this by integrating Householder projections.\n        *   The paper does not explicitly state new limitations of the *final* HousE model, but rather positions it as a comprehensive solution to previous limitations.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: Primarily focused on knowledge graph embedding for link prediction tasks. The framework's generalizability to other KG-related tasks (e.g., KG completion, entity classification) is implied but not explicitly demonstrated beyond link prediction.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: HousE significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in KGE by providing a powerful and general framework capable of simultaneously modeling all crucial relation patterns and RMPs, a challenge that previous models could only partially address. Its ability to perform high-dimensional rotations offers superior modeling capacity.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n        *   Provides a new paradigm for KGE by leveraging Householder parameterization, potentially inspiring further research into geometric transformations for representation learning.\n        *   The generalization of rotation-based models to arbitrary high dimensions opens avenues for exploring optimal embedding dimensions for different KGs.\n        *   The concept of invertible projections for RMPs could be adapted to other domains requiring flexible distance adjustments while preserving structural properties.\n        *   The theoretical proofs and efficient computation methods contribute to a deeper understanding and practical application of advanced linear algebra in machine learning.",

Typically, TKGs contain complex geometric structures, with various geometric structures interwoven. However, existing Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion (TKGC) methods either model TKGs in a single space or neglect the heterogeneity of different curvature spaces, thus constraining their capacity to capture these intricate geometric structures. In this paper, we propose a novel Integrating Multi-curvature shared and specific Embedding (IME) model for TKGC tasks. Concretely, IME models TKGs into multi-curvature spaces, including hyperspherical, hyperbolic, and Euclidean spaces. Subsequently, IME incorporates two key properties, namely space-shared property and space-specific property. The space-shared property facilitates the learning of commonalities across different curvature spaces and alleviates the spatial gap caused by the heterogeneous nature of multi-curvature spaces, while the space-specific property captures characteristic features. Meanwhile, IME proposes an Adjustable Multi-curvature Pooling (AMP) approach to effectively retain important information. Furthermore, IME innovatively designs similarity, difference, and structure loss functions to attain the stated objective. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the superior performance of IME over existing state-of-the-art TKGC models.",

However, existing FKGE methods only focus on reducing communication rounds by conducting multiple rounds of local training in each communication round, and ignore reducing the size of parameters transmitted within each communication round. To tackle the problem, we first find that universal reduction in embedding precision across all entities during compression can significantly impede convergence speed, underscoring the importance of maintaining embedding precision. We then propose bidirectional communication-efficient FedS based on Entity-Wise Top-K Sparsification strategy. During upload, clients dynamically identify and upload only the Top-K entity embeddings with the greater changes to the server. During download, the server first performs personalized embedding aggregation for each client. It then identifies and transmits the Top-K aggregated embeddings to each client. Besides, an Intermittent Synchronization Mechanism is used by FedS to mitigate negative effect of embedding inconsistency among shared entities of clients caused by heterogeneity of Federated Knowledge Graph. Extensive experiments across three datasets showcase that FedS significantly enhances communication efficiency with negligible (even no) performance degradation.",

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper by \\cite{zhang2024} for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Federated Knowledge Graph Embedding (FKGE) learning faces significant challenges in communication efficiency due to the considerable size of parameters (entity embeddings) and the extensive number of communication rounds required for training.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: High communication overhead impedes the training process, especially with numerous clients, large KGs, and high embedding dimensions, conflicting with bandwidth-constrained wireless edge networks and costly data plans. Existing FKGE methods only address reducing communication *rounds* (e.g., via more local iterations) but fail to reduce the *size of parameters transmitted within each round*, leading to a sustained high communication load.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: Existing FKGE methods (e.g., FedE \\cite{zhang2024}, FedEC \\cite{zhang2024}, FedLu \\cite{zhang2024}, FedR \\cite{zhang2024}) primarily focus on improving the quality of learned embeddings or reducing communication *rounds*. They are based on client-server or peer-to-peer architectures.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   They do not address the problem of reducing the *size of transmitted parameters* per communication round.\n        *   Initial attempts by the authors to integrate model compression techniques like Knowledge Distillation (KD) and Low-Rank Approximation (LRA) into FKGE proved ineffective. These methods universally reduce embedding precision across *all* entities, significantly slowing convergence and increasing total communication costs, even at low compression ratios. This highlights the critical importance of maintaining embedding precision for effective FKGE.\n        *   Traditional sparsification methods in Federated Learning operate parameter-wise, which can corrupt the semantic integrity of entity embeddings in FKGE due to the inherent coherence of multiple parameters forming an embedding.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes **FedS**, a bidirectional communication-efficient framework based on an **Entity-Wise Top-K Sparsification strategy** and an **Intermittent Synchronization Mechanism**.\n        *   **Upstream Entity-Wise Top-K Sparsification**: Clients dynamically identify and upload only the Top-K entity embeddings that exhibit the *greatest changes* (quantified by Cosine Similarity between current and history embeddings) to the server. This preserves the original precision of the selected entities.\n        *   **Downstream Personalized Entity-Wise Top-K Sparsification**: The server first performs personalized embedding aggregation for each client. Then, it identifies and transmits the Top-K aggregated embeddings back to each client, selecting based on *entity upload frequency* (rather than changes, due to FKG heterogeneity).\n        *   **Intermittent Synchronization Mechanism**: To mitigate negative effects of embedding inconsistency among shared entities caused by the heterogeneity of Federated Knowledge Graphs, FedS periodically (at fixed intervals) transmits *all* parameters between clients and the server.\n    *   **Novelty**:\n        *   First attempt to mitigate FKGE communication overhead by reducing the *size of transmitted parameters per communication round*.\n        *   Introduces a novel **Entity-Wise Top-K Sparsification strategy** that operates on entire entity embeddings, preserving their semantic integrity, unlike previous parameter-wise sparsification methods.\n        *   The bidirectional sparsification (upstream and downstream) combined with personalized aggregation and the intermittent synchronization mechanism specifically addresses the unique challenges of FKGE heterogeneity.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Theoretical Insight/Finding**: Demonstrated through extensive experiments that universal reduction in embedding precision (e.g., via KD or LRA) across all entities significantly impedes convergence speed in FKGE, underscoring the importance of maintaining embedding precision for critical entities.\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**:\n        *   **FedS framework**: A novel communication-efficient FKGE method.\n        *   **Entity-Wise Top-K Sparsification**: A new sparsification strategy tailored for FKGE, applied bidirectionally (upstream and downstream).\n        *   **Intermittent Synchronization Mechanism**: A mechanism to handle embedding inconsistency due to FKG heterogeneity.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: Integration of these components into a federated learning architecture for FKGE, compatible with existing FKGE methods as a constituent.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Extensive experiments were conducted across three datasets (FB15k-237-R10, FB15k-237-R5, FB15k-237-R3) and evaluated with three different knowledge graph embedding methods (TransE, RotatE, and presumably a third, though only two are explicitly mentioned in Table I).\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results**: The primary metric is communication efficiency (total transmitted parameter size, scaled by FedE's baseline) and performance degradation (convergence accuracy). Results show that FedS significantly enhances communication efficiency with negligible (even no) performance degradation, outperforming baseline FedE and the failed KD/SVD/SVD+ attempts in terms of total transmitted parameter size to reach comparable convergence accuracy.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The paper implicitly acknowledges the challenge of embedding inconsistency due to FKG heterogeneity, which necessitates the Intermittent Synchronization Mechanism. The effectiveness of Top-K selection relies on the assumption that changes in entity embeddings correlate with their importance for communication.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: FedS is designed for Federated Knowledge Graph Embedding learning, particularly in scenarios where communication bandwidth is a bottleneck. It is presented as a constituent that can be integrated into existing FKGE methods.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: This work significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in communication-efficient federated learning for knowledge graphs by being the first to effectively reduce the *size of transmitted parameters per communication round* without compromising model performance. It provides a crucial insight into the pitfalls of universal precision reduction in FKGE.\n    *   **Potential Impact**: FedS has the potential to enable more practical and scalable deployment of FKGE in resource-constrained environments (e.g., wireless edge networks), making collaborative KG learning more feasible for a wider range of applications. It opens new avenues for research into entity-aware communication strategies in federated learning.",

Despite the superior performance of KGE models in practice, we discover a deficiency in the expressiveness of some popular existing KGE models called Z-paradox. Motivated by the existence of Z-paradox, we propose a new KGE model called MQuinE that does not suffer from Z-paradox while preserves strong expressiveness to model various relation patterns including symmetric/asymmetric, inverse, 1-N/N-1/N-N, and composition relations with theoretical justification. Experiments on real-world knowledge bases indicate that Z-paradox indeed degrades the performance of existing KGE models, and can cause more than 20% accuracy drop on some challenging test samples.

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper identifies a fundamental deficiency in the expressiveness of many popular Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models, termed \"Z-paradox.\" This paradox causes KGE models to incorrectly infer relationships based on a specific graph pattern, leading to false positives.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: The Z-paradox is a serious issue, affecting a significant portion of test facts in standard KG benchmark datasets (e.g., ~35% in FB15k-237). It can lead to substantial accuracy drops (over 20% for models like TransE and RotatE on affected samples), degrading the practical performance and reliability of KGE models in applications like link prediction and information retrieval.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: The work builds upon and critically analyzes existing KGE models, particularly translation-based methods (e.g., TransE, RotatE, OTE, MQuadE) and bilinear semantic matching methods (e.g., DisMult, ComplEX, TuckER).\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: The paper theoretically proves that a wide range of existing KGE models, including all translation-based models and many bilinear models under certain conditions, suffer from the Z-paradox. This inherent limitation restricts their expressiveness and ability to accurately model complex relational data.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes MQuinE (Matrix Quin tuple Embedding), a new KGE model designed to circumvent the Z-paradox while maintaining strong expressiveness for various relation patterns.\n    *   **Score Function**: MQuinE measures the plausibility of a fact triplet `(h, r, t)` using the score function `s(h, r, t) = ||H R_h - R_t T + H R_c T||_F^2`. Here, `H` and `T` are symmetric matrix embeddings for head and tail entities, respectively, and `\u27e8R_h, R_t, R_c\u27e9` is a matrix triplet representing the relation `r`.\n    *   **Novelty**: The key innovation lies in the introduction of the `H R_c T` cross-term in the score function. This term is theoretically shown to be central to MQuinE's ability to avoid the Z-paradox, a property lacking in previous distance-based models. Additionally, the paper introduces **Z-sampling**, a novel negative sampling technique that explicitly collects and utilizes Z-patterns during training to mitigate their negative impact.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**:\n        *   Formal definition and characterization of the \"Z-paradox\" as a fundamental expressiveness bottleneck in KGE models \\cite{liu2024}.\n        *   Introduction of MQuinE, a novel matrix-based KGE model that inherently avoids the Z-paradox \\cite{liu2024}.\n        *   Development of Z-sampling, a specialized negative sampling strategy to explicitly address Z-patterns during model training \\cite{liu2024}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**:\n        *   Theoretical proof that a broad class of existing KGE models (including all translation-based models) suffer from the Z-paradox \\cite{liu2024}.\n        *   Theoretical justification that MQuinE does not suffer from Z-paradox (Theorem 3.4) while preserving the ability to model complex relation patterns such as symmetric/asymmetric, inverse, 1-N/N-1/N-N, and Abelian/non-Abelian compositions (Theorems 3.2, 3.3) \\cite{liu2024}.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: MQuinE utilizes symmetric matrix embeddings for entities and a quin-tuple of matrices for relations, offering a richer representation space compared to vector-based or simpler matrix-based models.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Experiments were performed on standard knowledge graph benchmark datasets: FB15k-237, WN18, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10. The evaluation focused on the link prediction task.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   **Impact of Z-paradox**: Demonstrated that Z-patterns negatively affect a significant portion of test facts (e.g., 35% in FB15k-237), causing over 20% accuracy drop for models like TransE and RotatE on these specific samples.\n        *   **MQuinE Performance**:\n            *   Successfully mitigates the negative impact of Z-paradox.\n            *   Achieved a 10% improvement in Hit@10 on test facts negatively impacted by Z-patterns on the FB15k-237 dataset \\cite{liu2024}.\n            *   Attained overall improvements of 7% in Hit@1 and 4% in Hit@10 on all test facts on FB15k-237 \\cite{liu2024}.\n            *   Outperformed existing KGE methods by a visible margin on most benchmark datasets \\cite{liu2024}.\n            *   The effectiveness of the proposed Z-sampling technique was empirically validated.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The paper primarily focuses on overcoming the Z-paradox and does not explicitly detail new limitations introduced by MQuinE. The model assumes entity embeddings are symmetric matrices. The increased complexity of matrix embeddings compared to vector embeddings might imply higher computational costs, though this is not highlighted as a limitation in the provided text.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: MQuinE is designed for general KGE tasks, particularly link prediction and information retrieval, where capturing complex relational patterns and avoiding spurious inferences are crucial.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: MQuinE significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art by identifying and providing a robust solution to the previously unaddressed \"Z-paradox\" expressiveness bottleneck in KGE models \\cite{liu2024}. It is presented as the first KGE model that is free from Z-paradox while preserving the ability to capture all major relation patterns.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: This work introduces a new criterion for evaluating KGE model expressiveness. Future KGE models will need to consider and ideally circumvent the Z-paradox. The Z-sampling technique could be adopted or adapted by other KGE models or graph neural network frameworks (e.g., NBFNet) to improve their robustness and accuracy.",

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \"Highly Efficient Knowledge Graph Embedding Learning with Orthogonal Procrustes Analysis\" \\cite{peng2021} for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   Existing Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) studies primarily focus on improving model performance, often overlooking the significant computational cost in terms of execution time and environmental impact (carbon footprint).\n    *   This problem is critical due to the widespread application of KGEs in NLP tasks (e.g., question answering, search engines) and the increasing energy requirements of modern AI models, necessitating more computationally cheap and eco-friendly approaches.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   Previous efforts to reduce computational cost in KGEs often focused on reducing model parameters (e.g., using quaternions).\n    *   Existing neural KGE frameworks typically rely on random mini-batches, which are difficult to parallelize efficiently due to potential synchronization errors when updating relation embeddings.\n    *   Orthogonal constraints in KGEs (e.g., RotatE, OTE) either limit modeling capacity (RotatE's 2D relations) or are computationally expensive due to gradient descent and iterative orthogonalization (OTE's Gram-Schmidt).\n    *   Most KGE methods employ negative sampling, which, while reducing training time for gradient-based updates, can become a bandwidth bottleneck when gradient computation is no longer the primary constraint.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **PROCRUSTES** is a lightweight, fast, and eco-friendly KGE training technique built upon three core innovations:\n        *   **Full Batch Learning via Relational Matrices**: Instead of random batches, tuples are grouped by their relations. This transforms tuple-level computation into matrix-level arithmetic, ensures each relation embedding is accessed by only one process (avoiding data corruption), and enables robust parallelization of KGE training. The objective function is formulated as `L = sum(i=1 to m) sum(j=1 to d/ds) ||H_i,j R_i,j - T_i,j||^2`.\n        *   **Closed-Form Orthogonal Procrustes Analysis for KGEs**: To minimize the Euclidean distance between head and tail entity matrices while enforcing orthogonality on relation matrices (`R_i,j`), \\cite{peng2021} leverages a closed-form solution derived from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Specifically, `R*_i,j = UV^T` where `SVD(H_i,j^T T_i,j) = U S V^T`. This allows for instant, globally optimal updates of relation embeddings in each iteration, drastically speeding up training compared to gradient-descent methods.\n        *   **Non-Negative-Sampling Training**: With the closed-form solution making gradient computation no longer a bottleneck, the paper identifies negative sampling as a new bandwidth bottleneck. PROCRUSTES eliminates negative sampling, updating all embeddings with positive samples only, further optimizing training speed.\n    *   **Segmented Embeddings**: The model is built upon segmented embeddings, where entity representation space is divided into multiple independent sub-spaces, allowing parallel processing and enhancing expressiveness.\n    *   **Spherisation Constraints**: To prevent the model from collapsing into a trivial optimum (all zeros), two spherisation steps are applied per epoch: centring (column-wise sum of matrices becomes zero) and length normalization (row-wise Euclidean norm of entity sub-vectors is one).\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**: Introduction of a KGE framework that integrates full batch learning based on relational matrices, a closed-form solution for Orthogonal Procrustes Analysis, and non-negative-sampling training.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: A parallelizable KGE training architecture where computation is decomposed into `m * (d/ds)` independent processes, significantly enhancing training speed and stability.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights**: Demonstrates that by restructuring the KGE optimization problem, a computationally expensive gradient-descent task can be transformed into an instantly solvable closed-form problem, leading to orders-of-magnitude efficiency gains.\n    *   **Semantic Richness**: For the first time, entity embeddings are shown to encode full relation information, allowing direct restoration of relation embeddings and leading to highly interpretable and semantically rich entity representations.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments**: Conducted multi-relational link prediction experiments on two standard benchmark datasets: WN18RR and FB15k-237.\n    *   **Baselines**: Compared against 13 strong baselines, including classical methods (TransE, DistMult, ComplEx) and recent state-of-the-art approaches (RotatE, OTE, SACN, TuckER).\n    *   **Performance Metrics**: Evaluated using Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit Ratio (H1, H3, H10).\n    *   **Efficiency Metrics**: Measured training time (minutes) and carbon dioxide production (grams).\n    *   **Key Results**:\n        *   **Effectiveness**: PROCRUSTES achieves competitive performance, often matching or exceeding state-of-the-art models. On WN18RR, it outperforms RotatE and OTE in MRR. Ablation studies show that variants with negative sampling and traditional batching can achieve even higher performance, sometimes reaching SOTA, albeit with increased computational cost.\n        *   **Efficiency**: PROCRUSTES significantly reduces training time (e.g., 14 minutes for WN18RR, 9 minutes for FB15k-237) by up to 98.4% compared to baselines. It also drastically lowers the carbon footprint (e.g., 37g CO2 for WN18RR, 42g for FB15k-237), representing up to a 99.3% reduction.\n        *   **Interpretability**: Visualizations demonstrate that PROCRUSTES's entity embeddings cluster semantically related entities, confirming their richer information content and interpretability.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   The base PROCRUSTES model, while highly efficient, might not always achieve the absolute highest performance compared to *all* SOTA models, especially on FB15k-237, where its variants with negative sampling and traditional batching perform better but are less efficient. This suggests a potential trade-off between extreme efficiency and peak performance in some scenarios.\n    *   The model requires specific spherisation constraints (centring and length normalization) to prevent collapse to a trivial optimum, indicating a potential instability without these safeguards.\n    *   The scope of applicability is primarily KGEs for link prediction, particularly in scenarios where computational resources and environmental impact are critical considerations.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   \\cite{peng2021} significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in KGE training by providing an algorithmically efficient framework that drastically reduces computational cost and environmental impact without sacrificing competitive performance.\n    *   It introduces a novel paradigm for KGE optimization by leveraging closed-form solutions and rethinking batching strategies, offering a blueprint for \"green AI\" in KGEs.\n    *   The ability to encode full relation information within entity embeddings and achieve high interpretability opens new avenues for understanding and utilizing KGEs.\n    *   This work has the potential to impact future research by encouraging the development of more sustainable and efficient AI models, particularly in resource-constrained environments or for large-scale knowledge graphs.",

        "summary": "This paper by \\cite{li2022} introduces a novel approach to operationalize and measure knowledge proximity within the US Patent Database using knowledge graphs and embedding techniques.\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific technical problem**: The paper addresses the challenge of measuring \"knowledge proximity\" \u2013 the strength of association between entities in a knowledge base \u2013 particularly for heterogeneous pairs of entities (e.g., inventor-domain, patent-assignee) within the complex US Patent Database.\n    *   **Importance and challenge**: Existing quantitative measures for knowledge proximity are often limited to homogeneous entity pairs (e.g., inventor-inventor, patent-patent) and capture only specific, isolated aspects of the patent database through individual relations (e.g., <patent, cite, patent>). This lack of interoperability across different entity types makes it difficult to gain a holistic understanding of knowledge relationships and innovation dynamics. A unified structural form that embodies all types of entities and relations is needed.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing approaches**:\n        *   **Homogeneous Proximity Measures**: Previous work measured proximity for patent-patent (e.g., shared citations, Euclidean distance on classification digits, LSA/SVD cosine similarity), assignee-assignee (e.g., overlapping patent classes, vector representations from patent distribution), and domain-domain (e.g., co-occurrence, citation distribution cosine similarity).\n        *   **Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) Techniques**: Reviewed translational distance models (TransE, TransR, RotateE) and semantic matching models (RESCAL, DistMult, ComplEx), which learn low-rank vector representations of entities and relations.\n    *   **Limitations of previous solutions**:\n        *   The reviewed proximity measures lack interoperability across different entity types, making them unsuitable for associating heterogeneous pairs (e.g., patent-inventor).\n        *   They capture only limited aspects of the patent database through individual relations.\n        *   Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), while powerful, are largely applicable to homogeneous graphs, whereas this work requires embedding a heterogeneous knowledge graph.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core technical method**:\n        *   **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Built a heterogeneous knowledge graph called 'PatNet' from the US Patent Database (1976-2020). PatNet comprises 10,273,843 entities (patents, inventors, assignees, groups, subsections) and 106,882,276 links, representing five types of relations: <patent, cite, patent>, <inventor, write, patent>, <assignee, own, patent>, <group, contain, patent>, and <subsection, comprise, groups>.\n        *   **Knowledge Graph Embedding**: Trained various graph embedding models (TransE_l1, TransE_l2, TransR, RESCAL, DistMult, ComplEx, RotateE) on PatNet to obtain low-dimensional vector embeddings for all entities and relations.\n        *   **Knowledge Proximity Measurement**: Defined knowledge proximity as the cosine similarity between the corresponding (or transformed) embeddings of entities.\n    *   **Novelty or difference**:\n        *   The primary innovation is the creation of a unified, comprehensive knowledge graph (PatNet) that integrates diverse patent metadata and relations into a single structural form.\n        *   This allows for the application of state-of-the-art knowledge graph embedding techniques to learn rich, interoperable representations for all entities, enabling the measurement of knowledge proximity for both homogeneous and, crucially, heterogeneous entity pairs in a consistent manner.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: Development of 'PatNet', a large-scale, heterogeneous knowledge graph specifically designed for patent metadata, integrating five distinct entity types and five relation types from the USPTO database.\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**: Application and comparative assessment of a suite of established knowledge graph embedding models (TransE, TransR, RESCAL, DistMult, ComplEx, RotateE) on the complex PatNet structure to derive meaningful entity and relation embeddings.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: Demonstrated that knowledge graph embeddings can effectively operationalize knowledge proximity for both homogeneous and heterogeneous entity pairs, overcoming the limitations of prior, siloed proximity measures.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments conducted**:\n        *   **Predicting Target Entities (Link Prediction)**: Evaluated the embedding models on their ability to predict missing entities in triples (e.g., identifying a missing patent, inventor, or domain) using a 10% test set of PatNet triples.\n        *   **Assessing Domain Expansion Profiles**: Examined how well the knowledge proximity measure (derived from embeddings) explains the historical domain expansion of 76,326 inventors and 15,283 assignees, based on the premise that agents tend to explore technologically \"less distant\" domains.\n    *   **Key performance metrics and comparison results**:\n        *   **Link Prediction**: Models were evaluated using Mean Rank (MR), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and Hits@k (k=1, 3, 10). RESCAL, ComplEx, DistMult, and TransE_l2 showed the best performance, with RESCAL achieving the highest MRR (0.928) and Hits@10 (0.958).\n        *   **Domain Expansion**: Models were evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the cumulative distribution of proximity percentiles and \"explainability\" (proportion of agents for whom a model exhibits higher AUC). TransE_l2 significantly outperformed other models, exhibiting the highest AUC for the combined expansion profiles of both assignees and inventors, and the highest explainability (highest AUC for nearly 70% of agents).\n        *   **Overall**: TransE_l2 was identified as the best-preferred model, demonstrating strong performance in both capturing the structure and semantics of PatNet (link prediction) and forming meaningful associations that explain real-world phenomena (domain expansion).\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical limitations**:\n        *   The study focused on a specific set of knowledge graph embedding models; other advanced models, particularly those designed for heterogeneous graphs or GNNs, were not extensively explored.\n        *   The embedding dimension was set to 500 due to hardware and time constraints, though it falls within a generally accepted range.\n        *   PatNet, by design, does not include cycles or two-way relations due to the unidirectional nature of the captured facts.\n    *   **Scope of applicability**: The methodology is primarily applied to the US Patent Database (1976-2020). While the approach is generalizable, the specific PatNet construction and empirical validation are tied to this dataset.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances the technical state-of-the-art**: This work provides a robust and unified framework for measuring knowledge proximity across diverse, heterogeneous entities within a complex knowledge base like patent data. It overcomes the limitations of previous siloed approaches by integrating all relevant metadata into a single knowledge graph and leveraging advanced embedding techniques.\n    *   **Potential impact on future research**:\n        *   Enables more comprehensive and nuanced analysis of innovation dynamics, technological evolution, and strategic decision-making in R&D.\n        *   Facilitates applications such as identifying emerging technologies, predicting technological trajectories, and recommending collaborations between inventors or assignees.\n        *   Offers a generalizable methodology for operationalizing knowledge proximity in other domains with rich, heterogeneous relational data, extending beyond patent analysis.",

Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** Existing embedding-based entity alignment approaches are significantly challenged by the scarcity of sufficient prior alignment (labeled training data), which leads to low precision in alignment results. Furthermore, alignment-oriented Knowledge Graph (KG) embedding remains largely unexplored.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge:** Knowledge Graphs are crucial for AI applications, but integrating heterogeneous KGs via entity alignment is essential to overcome the limitations of single KGs. While embedding-based methods offer advantages by exploiting inherent semantics independent of KG heterogeneity, their reliance on limited prior alignment hinders their effectiveness and accuracy.\n\n*   **2.

The problem is framed as a classification task aiming to maximize alignment likelihood under a one-to-one constraint.\n    *   **Novelty and Differentiation:**\n        *   **Alignment-Oriented KG Embedding:** Introduces a **limit-based objective function** that explicitly enforces positive triples to have absolutely low scores and negative triples to have high scores, reducing embedding drift and better capturing common semantics.\n        *   **\u03b5-Truncated Uniform Negative Sampling:** Generates more challenging negative triples by limiting the sampling scope to `s`-nearest neighbors in the embedding space, rather than arbitrary entities, forcing the model to learn finer distinctions.\n        *   **Parameter Swapping:** Leverages prior alignment by swapping aligned entities in their triples to calibrate embeddings of different KGs into a unified space.\n        *   **Bootstrapping Process with Global Optimization:** Unlike conventional bootstrapping methods that rely on local confidence thresholds, \\cite{sun2018} labels likely alignment by solving a **max-weighted matching problem on bipartite graphs**. This ensures a global optimal goal for labeling and adheres to the one-to-one alignment constraint, enhancing accuracy.\n        *   **Alignment Editing:** Allows entities to be relabeled or become unlabeled across iterations to resolve conflicts and reduce error propagation, improving the quality of the iteratively labeled data.\n        *   **Holistic Learning:** Combines the KG semantics objective with the alignment likelihood objective into a joint function for comprehensive embedding learning.\n\n*   **4. Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods:**\n        *   A **limit-based objective function** for learning alignment-oriented KG embeddings that explicitly controls the absolute scores of positive and negative triples.\n        *   **\u03b5-truncated uniform negative sampling** for generating more informative negative triples.\n        *   A **bootstrapping process** that iteratively expands training data by labeling likely alignments.\n        *   A **global optimal labeling strategy** based on max-weighted matching to ensure accurate and one-to-one alignment.\n        *   An **alignment editing method** to reduce error accumulation and resolve conflicts in the iteratively labeled data.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations:** Integration of a robust KG embedding model with a semi-supervised bootstrapping framework, jointly optimizing for KG semantics and alignment likelihood.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis:** The insight that explicitly controlling absolute scores of triples can improve common semantics capture for alignment, and that global optimization for iterative labeling is more robust than local confidence measures.\n\n*   **5. Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** Evaluated the proposed approach (BootEA) on three cross-lingual datasets (DBP15K: ZH-EN, JA-EN, FR-EN) and two large-scale datasets (DWY100K: DBP-WD, DBP-YG). Compared performance against state-of-the-art embedding-based methods: MTransE \\cite{chen2017}, IPTransE \\cite{zhu2017}, and JAPE \\cite{sun2017}. Ablation studies were performed to analyze the contributions of individual components (bootstrapping, negative sampling, labeling, editing).\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results:**\n        *   The proposed BootEA \"significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art embedding-based ones for entity alignment.\"\n        *   The bootstrapping process alone led to a \"13%\u201318% improvement on precision.\"\n        *   Experimental analysis confirmed that the alignment-oriented KG embedding, the bootstrapping process, and the alignment editing method all contributed positively to the overall performance improvement.\n\n*   **6. Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The approach assumes a one-to-one entity alignment scenario. Its effectiveness relies on the quality of initial embeddings for the \u03b5-truncated negative sampling. The choice of hyperparameters is crucial.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** Primarily designed for embedding-based entity alignment between different KGs, particularly effective in scenarios with limited initial prior alignment. Applicable to both cross-lingual and large-scale KG datasets.\n\n*   **7. Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advance State-of-the-Art:** \\cite{sun2018} significantly advances the state-of-the-art in embedding-based entity alignment by effectively addressing the critical challenge of limited prior alignment. It introduces robust mechanisms for iterative self-training and error mitigation, leading to substantial performance gains.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:** This work provides a strong foundation for future research in semi-supervised and low-resource entity alignment. The novel techniques for alignment-oriented embedding, adaptive negative sampling, and robust iterative labeling (especially the global optimization and editing methods) could inspire similar advancements in other knowledge graph completion and integration tasks.",

In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge graph embedding model named TransET, which takes advantage of entity types to learn more semantic features. More specifically, circle convolution based on the embeddings of entity and entity types is utilized to map head entity and tail entity to type-specific representations, then translation-based score function is used to learn the presentation triples.

However, complex relations such as N-to-1, 1-to-N and N-to-N still remain challenging to predict. In this work, we propose a novel distance-based approach for knowledge graph link prediction. First, we extend the RotatE from 2D complex domain to high dimensional space with orthogonal transforms to model relations. The orthogonal transform embedding for relations keeps the capability for modeling symmetric/anti-symmetric, inverse and compositional relations while achieves better modeling capacity. Second, the graph context is integrated into distance scoring functions directly. Specifically, graph context is explicitly modeled via two directed context representations. Each node embedding in knowledge graph is augmented with two context representations, which are computed from the neighboring outgoing and incoming nodes/edges respectively. The proposed approach improves prediction accuracy on the difficult N-to-1, 1-to-N and N-to-N cases.

Existing distance-based knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models, including the state-of-the-art RotatE \\cite{tang2019}, struggle with these relation types.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** Knowledge graphs are crucial for many AI applications (e.g., recommendation, question answering), but they are often incomplete and require periodic updates. Link prediction is vital for knowledge graph completion. Complex relations are challenging because a single entity-relation pair can map to multiple different entities, leading to ambiguity and reduced prediction accuracy \\cite{tang2019}. RotatE's limitation to 2D complex domain restricts its modeling capacity, and it does not explicitly consider graph context, which is beneficial for these complex relation types \\cite{tang2019}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** \\cite{tang2019} builds upon distance-based KGE models, particularly RotatE \\cite{tang2019}, which models relations as 2D rotations and naturally handles symmetric/anti-symmetric, inverse, and compositional relation patterns.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n        *   **RotatE \\cite{tang2019}:** Limited to 2D complex domain, restricting its overall modeling capacity. It also does not incorporate graph context, which is crucial for resolving ambiguities in complex relations.\n        *   **General KGE methods:** Many traditional KGE methods (e.g., TransE, DistMult, ComplEx) focus on modeling individual triples and often ignore the broader knowledge graph structure and context from neighboring nodes and edges \\cite{tang2019}.\n        *   **GNN-based context modeling:** While some approaches use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in an encoder-decoder framework to capture graph structure \\cite{tang2019}, this paper takes a different approach by integrating graph context directly into the distance scoring function.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The proposed approach, **Orthogonal Transform Embedding (OTE) with Graph Context (GC-OTE)**, combines two main innovations:\n        1.  **Orthogonal Transform Embedding (OTE):** Extends RotatE's 2D complex rotations to high-dimensional orthogonal transforms for relations. Entity embeddings are divided into *K* sub-embeddings, and each relation is represented by *K* orthogonal matrices, each operating on a sub-embedding. The Gram-Schmidt process is used to ensure the orthogonality of these relation matrices during training, with gradients handled by PyTorch's autograd \\cite{tang2019}.\n        2.  **Directed Graph Context Modeling:** Integrates explicit graph context directly into the distance scoring function. For each entity, two directed context representations are computed:\n            *   **Head-Relation Pair Context:** For a tail entity *t*, it's the average of representations of (head, relation) pairs where *t* is the tail.\n            *   **Relation-Tail Pair Context:** For a head entity *h*, it's the average of representations of (relation, tail) pairs where *h* is the head.\n            These context representations are then used as part of the distance scoring function \\cite{tang2019}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:**\n        *   **High-dimensional relation modeling:** Unlike RotatE's 2D rotations, OTE uses high-dimensional orthogonal transforms, significantly increasing modeling capacity while retaining the ability to model symmetric/anti-symmetric, inverse, and compositional relation patterns \\cite{tang2019}.\n        *   **Direct context integration:** Instead of using GNNs as a separate encoder, \\cite{tang2019} directly incorporates directed graph context into the distance scoring function, making it an integral part of the plausibility measurement.\n        *   **Ensemble-like scoring:** The final scoring function combines four distance scores (head-to-tail projection, tail-to-head projection, head-relation context, relation-tail context) across *K* sub-embeddings, effectively acting as an ensemble of *K* local GC-OTE models \\cite{tang2019}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods:**\n        *   **Orthogonal Transform Embedding (OTE):** A new method that extends RotatE's relation modeling from 2D complex space to high-dimensional orthogonal transforms, enhancing modeling capacity while preserving key relation properties (symmetry/antisymmetry, inversion, composition) \\cite{tang2019}.\n        *   **Directed Graph Context Modeling:** A novel approach to explicitly model and integrate graph context (neighboring entities and relations) directly into the distance scoring function for KGE, specifically designed to address complex relation types \\cite{tang2019}.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations:** The integration of orthogonal transforms with a sub-embedding group structure and the direct incorporation of directed graph context into a unified scoring function (GC-OTE) represents a novel architectural design for distance-based KGE \\cite{tang2019}.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis:** The paper proves that OTE retains the ability to model symmetry/antisymmetry, inversion, and compositional relation patterns, similar to RotatE \\cite{tang2019}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** Link prediction experiments were performed on two standard benchmark datasets \\cite{tang2019}.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics:** Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hits@k (k=1, 3, 10) were used to evaluate performance \\cite{tang2019}.\n    *   **Comparison Results:**\n        *   GC-OTE consistently outperformed RotatE \\cite{tang2019}, the previous state-of-the-art distance-based model, on both FB15k-237 and WN18RR datasets.\n        *   Achieved state-of-the-art results on FB15k-237, particularly noted for its effectiveness on datasets with many high in-degree nodes (implying better handling of complex relations) \\cite{tang2019}.\n        *   Achieved new state-of-the-art performance on the WN18RR dataset \\cite{tang2019}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:**\n        *   The context modeling relies on averaging neighboring entity-relation representations, which might be a relatively simple aggregation compared to more advanced GNN aggregation schemes \\cite{tang2019}.\n        *   The Gram-Schmidt process is applied during each forward pass to ensure orthogonality, which, while stable with autograd, might introduce some computational overhead compared to models without such constraints \\cite{tang2019}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** The method is primarily applicable to knowledge graph link prediction tasks, especially those involving complex N-to-1, 1-to-N, and N-to-N relations. It is designed for distance-based embedding models and could potentially be adapted to other translational embedding algorithms \\cite{tang2019}.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** \\cite{tang2019} significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in distance-based knowledge graph embedding by overcoming the modeling capacity limitations of RotatE and effectively integrating graph context. It provides new state-of-the-art results on prominent benchmarks \\cite{tang2019}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:**\n        *   **Improved handling of complex relations:** The explicit modeling of directed graph context and high-dimensional orthogonal transforms offers a robust framework for addressing challenging N-to-N type relations, which can inspire future research in this area.\n        *   **Hybrid KGE models:** The direct integration of context into the scoring function, rather than a separate encoder, presents an alternative paradigm for leveraging graph structure, potentially leading to more tightly coupled and efficient hybrid KGE models.\n        *   **Orthogonal transforms in KGE:** The successful application of orthogonal transforms via Gram-Schmidt and autograd could encourage further exploration of orthogonal constraints for relation modeling in other KGE architectures \\cite{tang2019}.",

They fail to properly handle the multiple heterogeneous embeddings (e.g., structural and visual) associated with entities in MMKGs.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge**:\n        *   Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) is a critical task due to the inherent incompleteness of real-world KGs, and KGE models trained with effective NS are key to addressing it.\n        *   MMKGE models leverage rich modal information, but current NS methods perform \"entity-level\" replacement, treating all embeddings of an entity as a single unit. This implicitly assumes modality alignment, hindering the model's ability to explicitly learn and align distinct modal embeddings (e.g., structural and visual).\n        *   Many existing NS methods are computationally expensive due to complex designs (e.g., GANs, large caches, clustering), making them inefficient for MMKGE training.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: The work builds upon general KGE methods (e.g., TransE \\cite{7}, DistMult \\cite{9}) and existing MMKGE frameworks (e.g., IKRL \\cite{11}, TransAE \\cite{13}) by specifically innovating the negative sampling component.

This fine-grained approach directly addresses the challenge of modality alignment.\n        *   **Combined Strategies \\cite{zhang2023}**: MANS integrates MANS-V with normal NS through structured approaches:\n            *   **MANS-T**: Divides training into two stages: an initial phase for modality alignment using MANS-V, followed by a phase for plausibility discrimination using normal NS.\n            *   **MANS-H**: Blends MANS-V and normal NS within each training epoch using a fixed, tunable proportion.\n            *   **MANS-A**: Adaptively determines the proportion of MANS-V based on the relative scores of unimodal and multi-modal components of the score function, thereby reducing the need for manual hyper-parameter tuning.\n        *   **Lightweight Design**: MANS avoids complex auxiliary modules, aiming for computational efficiency while improving the quality of negative samples for MMKGE.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**:\n        *   **Modality-Aware Negative Sampling (MANS) \\cite{zhang2023}**: The first negative sampling strategy specifically designed for multi-modal knowledge graph embedding.\n        *   **Visual Negative Sampling (MANS-V) \\cite{zhang2023}**: A novel modal-level sampling technique that samples only negative visual embeddings to explicitly achieve modality alignment between structural and visual features.\n        *   **Combined Sampling Strategies \\cite{zhang2023}**: Introduction of MANS-T, MANS-H, and MANS-A, which systematically integrate modal-level and entity-level negative sampling for comprehensive training.\n        *   **Adaptive Sampling Mechanism \\cite{zhang2023}**: MANS-A introduces an adaptive proportion for MANS-V based on the comparison of unimodal and multi-modal scores, eliminating the need for manual tuning of this hyper-parameter.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: MANS-V provides a mechanism to guide the model to identify visual features corresponding to each entity, thereby strengthening the alignment between different modal embeddings.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**:\n        *   Evaluated on two core Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) tasks: link prediction and triple classification.\n        *   Compared MANS \\cite{zhang2023} variants against normal NS and several state-of-the-art NS methods (No-Samp \\cite{17}, NSCaching \\cite{15}, SANS \\cite{16}, CAKE \\cite{18}, EANS \\cite{19}).\n        *   Further analysis explored the impact of sampling proportions, the effectiveness and trend of adaptive sampling, efficiency, and the quality of learned embeddings.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results**:\n        *   **Datasets**: Two well-known MMKG datasets: FB15K and DB15K (augmented with entity images).\n        *   **Link Prediction Metrics**: Mean Rank (MR), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and Hit@K (K=1, 3, 10), using a filtered setting.\n        *   **Triple Classification Metrics**: Accuracy (Acc), Precision (P), Recall (R), and F1-score (F1).\n        *   **Results**: Empirical results demonstrate that MANS \\cite{zhang2023} consistently outperforms existing NS baseline methods across various tasks and datasets, confirming its effectiveness in MMKGE. The paper also provides further explorations to substantiate MANS's efficiency and its ability to learn better, more semantically rich embeddings.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**:\n        *   Primarily focuses on the visual modality for modal-level negative sampling; explicit extension to other modalities (e.g., text) within the sampling mechanism is not detailed.\n        *   The underlying MMKGE model used for evaluation (IKRL \\cite{11}) employs a TransE-based score function, which might influence the generalizability of the adaptive sampling logic to other scoring functions.\n        *   Relies on pre-trained models (VGG-16 \\cite{27}) for visual feature extraction.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**:\n        *   Specifically designed for Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Embedding (MMKGE) models that utilize distinct embeddings for different modalities (e.g., structural and visual).\n        *   Applicable to KGC tasks such as link prediction and triple classification.\n        *   The \"lightweight\" design suggests applicability in scenarios where computational efficiency during training is a significant concern.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**:\n        *   MANS \\cite{zhang2023} is the first dedicated negative sampling strategy for MMKGE, addressing a critical gap in the field.\n        *   It introduces a novel modal-level sampling paradigm that explicitly tackles the challenge of aligning heterogeneous modal embeddings, a crucial aspect overlooked by previous entity-level NS methods.\n        *   Offers a lightweight and efficient alternative to complex, computationally expensive NS methods, making MMKGE training more practical.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n        *   Provides a foundational NS strategy that can potentially improve the performance and robustness of future MMKGE models.\n        *   The concept of modal-aware sampling could be extended to other multi-modal learning tasks beyond KGE.\n        *   The adaptive sampling mechanism could inspire further research into self-tuning or context-aware training strategies in complex embedding scenarios.\n        *   Encourages deeper investigation into the interplay between negative sampling strategies and modality alignment in multi-modal representation learning.",

It specifically aims to develop more expressive and effective Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models for this task.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge:** KGs are crucial for various AI applications (knowledge management, recommendation, chatbots). Existing distance-based KGE models, while effective, often rely on single 2D geometric transformations (e.g., translation, rotation, scaling) or limited 2D compound transformations, which may not fully capture the rich and complex underlying characteristics of diverse relations in KGs. Modeling non-commutative relations and achieving better parameterization are also challenges.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** This work builds upon and extends previous geometric transformation-based KGE models:\n        *   **TransE \\cite{ge2023}, RotatE \\cite{ge2023}, PairRE \\cite{ge2023}:** These models use single 2D geometric transformations (translation, rotation, scaling, respectively). \\cite{ge2023} positions them as degenerate cases of more complex compound models.\n        *   **CompoundE \\cite{ge2023}:** This model exploited the cascade of multiple 2D geometric transformations (translation, rotation, scaling). \\cite{ge2023} extends CompoundE by moving to 3D transformations and including more affine operations.\n        *   **Rotate3D \\cite{ge2023}:** This model leveraged 3D rotation for KGE, demonstrating better modeling power for non-commutative relations than 2D rotation (RotatE). \\cite{ge2023} is inspired by Rotate3D's use of 3D space.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n        *   Single 2D transformations are often insufficient to model the diversity and complexity of relations in KGs.\n        *   CompoundE, while powerful, was limited to 2D transformations and a specific set of operations.\n        *   Previous approaches lacked a systematic way to explore and combine a wider range of geometric transformations, especially in 3D, or to effectively ensemble multiple model variants.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** \\cite{ge2023} proposes **CompoundE3D**, a family of KGE models that leverage 3D compound geometric transformations to model relations between entities.\n        *   It incorporates five 3D affine operations: **Translation (T), Scaling (S), Rotation (R), Reflection (F), and Shear (H)**. These operations are represented as 4x4 matrices in homogeneous coordinates and can be cascaded.\n        *   Relations are modeled by applying these compound operators to head entities, tail entities, or both, leading to three scoring functions: `CompoundE3D-Head`, `CompoundE3D-Tail`, and `CompoundE3D-Complete`.\n        *   A high-dimensional relation operator is represented as a block diagonal matrix of these compound operators.\n    *   **Novelty/Differentiation:**\n        *   **Expanded Transformation Space:** It extends beyond 2D transformations and the limited set of operations in CompoundE by including Reflection and Shear in 3D space, significantly enlarging the design space for relation representations.\n        *   **Adapted Beam Search Algorithm:** To navigate the \"huge search space\" of possible CompoundE3D variants (combinations of operations and their application points), \\cite{ge2023} introduces an adapted beam search algorithm. This algorithm gradually builds more complex scoring functions from simpler ones, optimizing for performance while managing complexity.\n        *   **Model Ensemble Strategies:** To further boost performance and mitigate errors from individual variants, \\cite{ge2023} explores two ensemble strategies:\n            *   **Weighted-Distances-Sum (WDS):** Combines scores from top-k variants using uniform, geometric, or learnable weights.\n            *   **Rank Fusion:** Applies unsupervised rank aggregation functions to unify rank predictions from individual model variants.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods:**\n        *   Introduction of 3D affine operations (Translation, Scaling, Rotation, Reflection, Shear) for KGE, allowing for more versatile relation representations.\n        *   Development of the CompoundE3D framework, which systematically combines these 3D operations.\n        *   An adapted beam search algorithm for efficient discovery of optimal CompoundE3D model variants, balancing complexity and performance.\n        *   Exploration and application of two ensemble strategies (Weighted-Distances-Sum and Rank Fusion) to aggregate decisions from multiple CompoundE3D variants.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis:** Analysis of the properties of each geometric operation and its advantages in modeling different relation types, backed by empirical results.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** The effectiveness and flexibility of CompoundE3D were experimentally verified through link prediction tasks.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Results:** Experiments were conducted on four popular link prediction datasets. The paper claims that CompoundE3D, especially with ensemble strategies, yields \"superior performance\" and that its effectiveness is \"experimentally verified.\" (Specific metrics like MRR, Hits@N are implied for link prediction, though not detailed in the provided abstract/intro).\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:**\n        *   The inherent complexity of the search space for optimal compound operations is a significant challenge, which the beam search algorithm aims to address but doesn't eliminate.\n        *   The choice of the total number of stages for compounding operations is a user-selected hyper-parameter.\n        *   The effectiveness of ensemble methods relies on the diversity and quality of the individual variants.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** Primarily focused on distance-based KGE models for link prediction in general KGs.

However, high-dimensional KGEs pose huge challenges to storage and computing resources and are not suitable for resource-limited or time-constrained applications, for which faster and cheaper reasoning is necessary. To address this problem, we propose DualDE, a knowledge distillation method to build low-dimensional student KGE from pre-trained high-dimensional teacher KGE. DualDE considers the dual-influence between the teacher and the student. In DualDE, we propose a soft label evaluation mechanism to adaptively assign different soft label and hard label weights to different triples, and a two-stage distillation approach to improve the student's acceptance of the teacher. Our DualDE is general enough to be applied to various KGEs. Experimental results show that our method can successfully reduce the embedding parameters of a high-dimensional KGE by 7\u00d7 - 15\u00d7 and increase the inference speed by 2\u00d7 - 6\u00d7 while retaining a high performance. We also experimentally prove the effectiveness of our soft label evaluation mechanism and two-stage distillation approach via ablation study.",

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \\cite{zhu2020} for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: High-dimensional Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) offer superior reasoning capabilities but demand substantial storage and computing resources, making them unsuitable for resource-limited or time-constrained applications. Directly training low-dimensional KGEs typically results in poor performance.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: There is a critical need for faster and cheaper KGE reasoning, especially for deployment on edge devices, mobile platforms, or in real-time online prediction systems. The challenge lies in reducing KGE dimensionality and resource consumption while preserving high reasoning accuracy.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: The work builds upon Knowledge Distillation (KD) techniques, which transfer knowledge from a large \"teacher\" model to a smaller \"student\" model.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   **KGE Compression**: Prior methods like quantization (e.g., \\cite{zhu2020} [23]) reduce size but do not improve inference speed and can complicate model convergence.\n        *   **Knowledge Distillation for KGEs**: MulDE \\cite{zhu2020} [13] was an early attempt but required pre-training multiple teacher models.\n        *   **General KD**: Many existing KD methods treat all soft labels from the teacher equally, failing to account for their varying quality, and do not sufficiently explore the student's influence on the teacher's learning process.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: DualDE is a novel knowledge distillation framework that constructs a low-dimensional student KGE from a pre-trained high-dimensional teacher KGE. It considers the \"dual-influence\" between the teacher and the student.\n    *   **Novelty**:\n        *   **Soft Label Evaluation Mechanism**: Adaptively assigns different soft and hard label weights to triples based on the perceived quality (reliability) of the teacher's soft labels. This prevents negative impacts from unreliable teacher scores.\n        *   **Two-Stage Distillation Approach**: Improves the student's acceptance of the teacher. In the first stage, the teacher is static. In the second stage, the teacher is unfrozen and adjusted by learning from the student's output, making the teacher more \"acceptable\" and aligned with the student's learning state.\n        *   **Distillation Objective**: The student learns both the \"credibility\" (score difference) and the \"embedding structure\" (length ratio and angle between entity embeddings) of triples from the teacher.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**:\n        *   Introduction of a soft label evaluation mechanism that dynamically weights distillation loss components based on the teacher's confidence in its predictions for individual triples.\n        *   A two-stage distillation strategy where the teacher model is adaptively refined in the second stage based on the student's learning progress.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: A general framework for KGE distillation that is applicable to various KGE models (e.g., TransE, ComplEx, RotatE, SimplE).\n    *   **Theoretical Insights**: Proposes and validates the concept of \"dual-influence\" in knowledge distillation, emphasizing that both teacher-to-student and student-to-teacher interactions are crucial for optimal distillation.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Evaluated DualDE on standard KG datasets (WN18RR, FB15k-237) using several typical KGE models (ComplEx, RotatE, TransE, SimplE). Ablation studies were performed to confirm the effectiveness of the soft label evaluation mechanism and the two-stage distillation approach.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   Successfully reduced embedding parameters by 7x-15x.\n        *   Increased inference speed by 2x-6x.\n        *   Maintained high performance, showing only a little or no loss of accuracy compared to the original high-dimensional teacher KGEs.\n        *   Significantly outperformed low-dimensional KGEs trained directly from scratch.\n        *   Ablation studies confirmed that both the soft label evaluation mechanism and the two-stage distillation approach contribute positively to the distillation results.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The paper focuses on distilling from an *already pre-trained* high-dimensional KGE. The quality of the initial teacher model is assumed to be high.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: Primarily targets KGEs for faster and cheaper reasoning in scenarios with limited computing resources (e.g., edge computing, mobile devices) or strict time constraints (e.g., online financial predictions).\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: DualDE significantly advances the practical applicability of KGEs by providing an effective method to compress models and accelerate inference without substantial performance degradation. It introduces novel, adaptive mechanisms for knowledge distillation.\n    *   **Potential Impact**: This work enables the widespread deployment of KGEs in real-world, resource-constrained environments, broadening their utility beyond high-performance computing settings. The proposed dual-influence perspective and adaptive distillation mechanisms could inspire future research in model compression and knowledge transfer across various AI domains.",

Deriving new and reliable knowledge from existing knowledge by KG embedding technology is a cutting-edge method. Some add a variety of additional information to aid reasoning, namely multimodal reasoning. However, few works based on the existing biomedical KGs are focused on specific diseases. Results This work develops a construction and multimodal reasoning process of Specific Disease Knowledge Graphs (SDKGs). We construct SDKG-11, a SDKG set including five cancers, six non-cancer diseases, a combined Cancer5 and a combined Diseases11, aiming to discover new reliable knowledge and provide universal pre-trained knowledge for that specific disease field. SDKG-11 is obtained through original triplet extraction, standard entity set construction, entity linking and relation linking. We implement multimodal reasoning by reverse-hyperplane projection for SDKGs based on structure, category and description embeddings. Multimodal reasoning improves pre-existing models on all SDKGs using entity prediction task as the evaluation protocol. We verify the model\u2019s reliability in discovering new knowledge by manually proofreading predicted drug\u2013gene, gene\u2013disease and disease\u2013drug pairs. Using embedding results as initialization parameters for the biomolecular interaction classification, we demonstrate the universality of embedding models.

TransE is a promising method proposed recently, which is very efficient while achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance. We discuss some mapping properties of relations which should be considered in embedding, such as reflexive, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many. We note that TransE does not do well in dealing with these properties. Some complex models are capable of preserving these mapping properties but sacrifice efficiency in the process. To make a good trade-off between model capacity and efficiency, in this paper we propose TransH which models a relation as a hyperplane together with a translation operation on it. In this way, we can well preserve the above mapping properties of relations with almost the same model complexity of TransE. Additionally, as a practical knowledge graph is often far from completed, how to construct negative examples to reduce false negative labels in training is very important. Utilizing the one-to-many/many-to-one mapping property of a relation, we propose a simple trick to reduce the possibility of false negative labeling. We conduct extensive experiments on link prediction, triplet classification and fact extraction on benchmark datasets like WordNet and Freebase. Experiments show TransH delivers significant improvements over TransE on predictive accuracy with comparable capability to scale up.\n \n",

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \"Knowledge Graph Embedding by Translating on Hyperplanes\" \\cite{wang2014} for a literature review:\n\n### Technical Paper Analysis: Knowledge Graph Embedding by Translating on Hyperplanes \\cite{wang2014}\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** The paper addresses the challenge of embedding large-scale knowledge graphs (composed of entities and relations) into a continuous vector space, specifically focusing on the limitations of existing efficient models like TransE \\cite{wang2014} in handling complex relation mapping properties. TransE \\cite{wang2014} struggles with reflexive, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many relations because it assumes a single, fixed representation for an entity regardless of the relation it participates in.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge:** Knowledge graphs are vital for AI applications (e.g., web search, Q&A). Key challenges include bridging symbolic/logical systems with numerical computing and aggregating global knowledge. While TransE \\cite{wang2014} is efficient and performs well on many tasks, its inability to model complex relation types accurately limits its applicability. More complex models can handle these properties but sacrifice efficiency and often overall predictive performance. The challenge is to achieve a good trade-off between model capacity (handling complex relations) and computational efficiency.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** This work builds directly upon translation-based embedding models, particularly TransE \\cite{wang2014}, which represents relations as translation vectors. It positions itself as an improvement over TransE \\cite{wang2014} by addressing its specific flaws while retaining its efficiency. The paper also briefly compares against other embedding models like Unstructured, Distant Model, Bilinear Model, Single Layer Model, and NTN, highlighting their varying complexities and performance.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n        *   **TransE \\cite{wang2014}:** While efficient and achieving state-of-the-art performance in many scenarios, TransE \\cite{wang2014} fails to adequately model relations with mapping properties such as reflexive, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many. This is because it enforces a single representation for an entity across all relations, leading to problematic consequences (e.g., `h=t` for reflexive relations, or `h_0=...=h_m` for many-to-one relations in an ideal error-free embedding).\n        *   **More Complex Models (e.g., NTN):** These models are capable of preserving complex mapping properties but incur significantly higher model complexity and running time, often resulting in worse overall predictive performance compared to TransE \\cite{wang2014}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper proposes **TransH (Translation on Hyperplanes)**. In TransH, a relation `r` is modeled by two components: a relation-specific hyperplane (defined by its normal vector `w_r`) and a translation vector `d_r` that lies *within* this hyperplane.\n        *   For a given triplet `(h, r, t)`, the entity embeddings `h` and `t` are first projected onto the relation-specific hyperplane `w_r`. These projections are denoted as `h_perp` and `t_perp`.\n        *   The scoring function `f_r(h,t)` measures the plausibility of the triplet by calculating the squared L2-norm of the difference between `h_perp + d_r` and `t_perp`: `f_r(h,t) = ||(h - w_r^T h w_r) + d_r - (t - w_r^T t w_r)||_2^2`. A lower score indicates higher plausibility.\n        *   Constraints are applied during training: `||w_r||_2 = 1` (unit normal vector) and `w_r^T d_r = 0` (ensuring `d_r` is orthogonal to `w_r`, thus lying in the hyperplane).\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:**\n        *   **Distributed Entity Representations:** By projecting entities onto relation-specific hyperplanes, TransH \\cite{wang2014} implicitly allows an entity to have different \"roles\" or distributed representations depending on the relation it is involved in. This directly addresses the core limitation of TransE \\cite{wang2014}.\n        *   **Efficiency and Capacity Trade-off:** TransH \\cite{wang2014} achieves this enhanced modeling capacity with almost the same model complexity as TransE \\cite{wang2014} (O(nek + 2nrk) vs. O(nek + nrk)), offering a better balance than previous complex models.\n        *   **Improved Negative Sampling:** Introduces a novel strategy for constructing negative examples during training. It uses a Bernoulli distribution to decide whether to corrupt the head or tail entity, with probabilities based on the relation's `tph` (tails per head) and `hpt` (heads per tail) statistics. This reduces the likelihood of generating false negative labels, which is crucial for incomplete knowledge graphs.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **TransH Model:** A novel knowledge graph embedding model that represents relations as hyperplanes with translation vectors on them, enabling relation-specific entity representations.\n    *   **Scoring Function:** A new scoring function `f_r(h,t)` that incorporates entity projections onto relation-specific hyperplanes before applying translation.\n    *   **Orthogonality Constraint:** The introduction of a constraint `w_r^T d_r = 0` to ensure the translation vector `d_r` lies within the relation's hyperplane.\n    *   **Bernoulli Negative Sampling:** A practical and effective method for constructing negative training examples that leverages relation mapping properties to reduce false negative labels.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** Extensive experiments were performed on three tasks: link prediction, triplet classification, and fact extraction.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results:**\n        *   **Datasets:** WN18 (a subset of WordNet) and FB15k (a dense subgraph of Freebase).\n        *   **Metrics (Link Prediction):** Mean rank (lower is better) and Hits@10 (proportion of correct entities ranked in the top 10, higher is better). Both \"raw\" and \"filt\" (filtered out existing valid triplets) settings were used.\n        *   **Results:**\n            *   TransH \\cite{wang2014} consistently and significantly outperforms TransE \\cite{wang2014} on predictive accuracy, especially on the larger and more complex FB15k dataset.\n            *   Detailed analysis on FB15k shows TransH \\cite{wang2014} brings substantial improvements to TransE \\cite{wang2014} for one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many relations, and surprisingly, also significantly improves performance on one-to-one relations (>60% improvement).\n            *   TransH \\cite{wang2014} demonstrates comparable running time and scalability to TransE \\cite{wang2014}.\n            *   The proposed Bernoulli negative sampling strategy (\"bern.\") consistently yields better performance than uniform sampling (\"unif\").\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The model still operates within a translation-based geometric framework. While it addresses TransE's \\cite{wang2014} specific limitations, it doesn't explore fundamentally different embedding paradigms. The effectiveness is demonstrated on specific benchmark datasets, and its performance on highly sparse or different types of knowledge graphs might vary.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** Primarily focused on knowledge graph embedding for tasks like link prediction, triplet classification, and fact extraction on large-scale, multi-relational graphs.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** TransH \\cite{wang2014} significantly advances the state-of-the-art in knowledge graph embedding by providing a more expressive and robust model that effectively handles complex relation mapping properties (reflexive, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many) which were problematic for previous efficient models like TransE \\cite{wang2014}. It achieves this improved capacity with almost the same model complexity and efficiency as TransE \\cite{wang2014}, offering a superior trade-off between model capacity and computational cost.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:** This work highlights the critical importance of considering relation mapping properties and sophisticated negative sampling strategies in knowledge graph embedding. It provides a strong, efficient, and highly performant baseline for future research, encouraging the development of models that can capture richer relational semantics without sacrificing scalability. It paves the way for more accurate and reliable knowledge graph completion and reasoning in various AI applications.",

Recently, embedding methods have been used for entity alignment tasks, that learn a vector-space representation of entities which preserves their similarity in the original KGs. A wide variety of supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised methods have been proposed that exploit both factual (attribute based) and structural information (relation based) of entities in the KGs. Still, a quantitative assessment of their strengths and weaknesses in real-world KGs according to different performance metrics and KG characteristics is missing from the literature. In this work, we conduct the first meta-level analysis of popular embedding methods for entity alignment, based on a statistically sound methodology. Our analysis reveals statistically significant correlations of different embedding methods with various meta-features extracted by KGs and rank them in a statistically significant way according to their effectiveness across all real-world KGs of our testbed. Finally, we study interesting trade-offs in terms of methods\u2019 effectiveness and efficiency.",

However, the recent availability of temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) that contain time information for each fact created the need for reasoning over time in such TKGs. In this regard, we present a new approach of TKG embedding, TeRo, which defines the temporal evolution of entity embedding as a rotation from the initial time to the current time in the complex vector space. Specially, for facts involving time intervals, each relation is represented as a pair of dual complex embeddings to handle the beginning and the end of the relation, respectively. We show our proposed model overcomes the limitations of the existing KG embedding models and TKG embedding models and has the ability of learning and inferring various relation patterns over time. Experimental results on three different TKGs show that TeRo significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art models for link prediction. In addition, we analyze the effect of time granularity on link prediction over TKGs, which as far as we know has not been investigated in previous literature.",

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \"TeRo: A Time-aware Knowledge Graph Embedding via Temporal Rotation\" by Xu et al. \\cite{xu2020} for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Traditional Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models disregard time information, making them ineffective for Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) which contain time-aware facts (quadruples `(s, r, o, t)`). Existing TKG embedding (TKGE) models, often extensions of TransE or DistMult, inherit limitations of their base models, struggling to capture various complex relation patterns (e.g., temporary, asymmetric, reflexive relations) over time. Furthermore, many existing TKGE models do not robustly handle diverse time annotations, such as time intervals.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: The increasing availability of TKGs necessitates models that can effectively characterize and reason over their complex temporal dynamics and multi-relational nature. Accurately modeling temporal evolution and diverse relation patterns is crucial for tasks like link prediction, where time-awareness can significantly refine predictions (e.g., `(Barack Obama, visits, ?, 2014-07-08)`). The challenge lies in developing a unified framework that is expressive enough to capture temporal dynamics, various relation patterns, and different forms of time annotations without excessive complexity.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: The work builds upon KGE models, particularly distance-based models like RotatE, which uses rotations in complex space. It positions itself as an advancement over existing TKGE models that are primarily temporal extensions of TransE (e.g., TTransE, HyTE, ATiSE) and DistMult (e.g., Know-Evolve, TDistMult).\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   **Static KGEs**: Cannot model temporary relations (e.g., `visits` being valid at `t1` but not `t2`).\n        *   **TransE-based TKGEs**: Struggle with multiple reflexive relations (e.g., `equalTo`, `subsetOf`) as they tend to enforce relation embeddings to zero for such cases.\n        *   **DistMult-based TKGEs**: Cannot capture asymmetric relations (e.g., `parentOf`) because their scoring functions are symmetric (`score(s,r,o,t) = score(o,r,s,t)`).\n        *   **DE-SimplE**: While capable of modeling various patterns, it focuses only on event-based TKGs and cannot model facts involving time intervals.\n        *   **General TKGEs**: Many previous works use fixed or specific time granularities, and the effect of time granularity on performance has not been thoroughly investigated.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: TeRo defines the temporal evolution of an entity embedding as an element-wise rotation from its initial, time-independent state to its current time-specific state in a complex vector space.\n        *   For a quadruple `(s, r, o, t)`, time-specific entity embeddings `s_t` and `o_t` are derived from time-independent `s` and `o` by `s_t = s * phi_t` and `o_t = o * phi_t`, where `phi_t` is a complex vector representing the rotation for time `t`. Each element of `phi_t` has a modulus of 1, acting as a rotation in the complex plane.\n        *   The plausibility score for a fact `(s, r, o, t)` is `f_TeRo(s,r,o,t) = ||s_t + r - o_t||`, where `r` is the relation embedding.\n    *   **Novelty/Differentiation**:\n        *   **Temporal Rotation**: The core innovation is modeling temporal evolution via rotation in complex space, inspired by Euler's identity, which allows for dynamic changes in entity embeddings over time while preserving their underlying structure.\n        *   **Handling Time Intervals**: For facts with time intervals `[t_b, t_e]`, TeRo introduces a pair of dual complex relation embeddings (`r_b` for beginning, `r_e` for end). The score is the mean of scores for `(s, r_b, o, t_b)` and `(s, r_e, o, t_e)`. This allows TeRo to adapt to various time annotations: time points, beginning/end times, and full intervals.\n        *   **Expressiveness for Relation Patterns**: By leveraging complex embeddings and temporal rotations, TeRo inherently supports temporary, asymmetric, and reflexive relations, overcoming the limitations of TransE and DistMult extensions.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithm**: Introduction of TeRo, a novel TKG embedding model that uses temporal rotation in complex vector space to capture time-aware entity evolution.\n    *   **Method for Time Intervals**: A unique approach to model facts with time intervals by employing dual relation embeddings (`r_b`, `r_e`), enabling robust handling of diverse temporal annotations.\n    *   **Enhanced Expressiveness**: Demonstrated capability to learn and infer temporary, asymmetric, and reflexive relation patterns, which are challenging for many existing TKGE models.\n    *   **Empirical Analysis of Time Granularity**: First investigation into the effect of time granularity (length of time steps) on link prediction performance over TKGs, providing insights into dataset-specific temporal modeling.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Link prediction tasks were performed on four diverse TKGs. An additional analysis was conducted on the effect of time granularity.\n    *   **Datasets**:\n        *   ICEWS14, ICEWS05-15: Event-based datasets with time points.\n        *   YAGO11k, Wikidata12k: Datasets with mixed time annotations, including time points, beginning/end times, and time intervals.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**: Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hits@k (Hits@1, Hits@3, Hits@10) under a time-wise filtered setting.\n    *   **Comparison Results**: TeRo significantly outperformed several state-of-the-art KGE models (TransE, DistMult, ComplEx-N3, RotatE, QuatE) and existing TKGE models (TTransE, TA-TransE, TA-DistMult, DE-SimplE, ATiSE) across all four datasets for link prediction.\n    *   **Time Granularity Analysis**: Experiments showed that tuning time granularity (e.g., `u` days for ICEWS, `thre` minimum triples per interval for YAGO/Wikidata) impacts performance, suggesting optimal granularities exist for different datasets.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The space complexity of TeRo is `O(ned + nrd + n_phi * d)`, where `n_phi` is the number of time steps. While this can be managed by tuning time granularity (`n_phi < ne`), a very fine granularity could increase memory requirements. The model assumes that temporal evolution can be effectively modeled as a rotation in complex space.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: TeRo is applicable to TKGs with various forms of time annotations, including discrete time points and continuous time intervals. It is particularly well-suited for datasets where relations exhibit temporary, asymmetric, or reflexive properties.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: TeRo advances the technical state-of-the-art in TKGEs by introducing a more expressive and robust model that effectively captures temporal dynamics and diverse relation patterns, overcoming key limitations of previous TransE/DistMult-based approaches.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n        *   Provides a strong baseline and a novel perspective (temporal rotation) for future TKGE research.\n        *   The dual relation embedding mechanism for time intervals offers a valuable technique for handling complex temporal annotations.\n        *   The investigation into time granularity highlights a critical, yet underexplored, aspect of TKG modeling, opening avenues for research into adaptive or learned time granularity.\n        *   Its ability to model various relation patterns makes it a versatile tool for reasoning over complex real-world TKGs.",

TKGs typically contain complex geometric structures, such as hierarchical, ring, and chain structures, which can often be mixed together. However, embedding TKGs into Euclidean space, as is typically done with TKG completion (TKGC) models, presents a challenge when dealing with high-dimensional nonlinear data and complex geometric structures. To address this issue, we propose a novel TKGC model called multicurvature adaptive embedding (MADE). MADE models TKGs in multicurvature spaces, including flat Euclidean space (zero curvature), hyperbolic space (negative curvature), and hyperspherical space (positive curvature), to handle multiple geometric structures. We assign different weights to different curvature spaces in a data-driven manner to strengthen the ideal curvature spaces for modeling and weaken the inappropriate ones. Additionally, we introduce the quadruplet distributor (QD) to assist the information interaction in each geometric space. Ultimately, we develop an innovative temporal regularization to enhance the smoothness of timestamp embeddings by strengthening the correlation of neighboring timestamps. Experimental results show that MADE outperforms the existing state-of-the-art TKGC models.",

        "abstract": "The task of link prediction for knowledge graphs is to predict missing relationships between entities. Knowledge graph embedding, which aims to represent entities and relations of a knowledge graph as low dimensional vectors in a continuous vector space, has achieved promising predictive performance. If an embedding model can cover different types of connectivity patterns and mapping properties of relations as many as possible, it will potentially bring more benefits for link prediction tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel embedding model, namely LineaRE, which is capable of modeling four connectivity patterns (i.e., symmetry, antisymmetry, inversion, and composition) and four mapping properties (i.e., one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many) of relations. Specifically, we regard knowledge graph embedding as a simple linear regression task, where a relation is modeled as a linear function of two low-dimensional vector-presented entities with two weight vectors and a bias vector. Since the vectors are defined in a real number space and the scoring function of the model is linear, our model is simple and scalable to large knowledge graphs. Experimental results on multiple widely used real-world datasets show that the proposed LineaRE model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art models for link prediction tasks.",

KGs often suffer from incompleteness.\n    *   **Motivation**: Traditional symbolic representation algorithms for KGs have high computational complexity and lack scalability. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models address this by representing entities and relations as low-dimensional vectors. The effectiveness of KGE models is significantly enhanced if they can comprehensively capture diverse connectivity patterns (e.g., symmetry, antisymmetry, inversion, composition) and mapping properties (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many) of relations, which many existing models struggle with.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches**: KGE models are broadly categorized into translational distance models (e.g., TransE, TransH, TransR, TransD, RotatE) and semantic matching models (e.g., DistMult, ComplEx, ConvE).\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   **Translational Models**: TransE struggles with symmetric relations and complex mapping properties (1-to-N, N-to-1, N-to-N). Its variants (TransH, TransR, TransD) improve on complex mapping but often fail to model inversion and composition patterns. RotatE can model all connectivity patterns but does not address complex mapping properties.\n        *   **Semantic Matching Models**: DistMult can only handle symmetric relations. ComplEx addresses antisymmetry but not composition, and increases complexity with complex-valued embeddings. RESCAL is prone to overfitting and not scalable. Neural network-based models like ConvE offer good performance but can be more complex.\n    *   **Positioning**: \\cite{peng2020} proposes LineaRE as a simple, scalable model that uniquely combines the ability to model *all* four connectivity patterns and *all* four mapping properties, outperforming existing models that typically specialize in one aspect while sacrificing others.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: \\cite{peng2020} proposes LineaRE (Linear Regression Embedding), which interprets knowledge graph embedding as a simple linear regression task. For a given triplet `(h, r, t)`, the model expects the equation `w1_r * h + br = w2_r * t` to hold, where `h` and `t` are low-dimensional real-valued entity vectors, and `w1_r`, `w2_r`, and `br` are relation-specific real-valued weight and bias vectors. The `*` denotes the Hadamard (element-wise) product.\n    *   **Scoring Function**: The plausibility of a triplet `(h, r, t)` is measured by `f_r(h,t) = ||w1_r * h + br - w2_r * t||_1`, where a lower score indicates higher plausibility.\n    *   **Innovation**:\n        *   **Comprehensive Modeling**: The core innovation lies in demonstrating that this simple linear regression framework can mathematically model all four connectivity patterns (symmetry, antisymmetry, inversion, composition) and all four complex mapping properties (1-to-1, 1-to-N, N-to-1, N-to-N).\n        *   **Simplicity and Scalability**: By defining all vectors in a real number space and using a linear scoring function, LineaRE is inherently simple and scalable to large knowledge graphs, contrasting with more complex models involving matrices, projections, or complex numbers.\n        *   **Generalization of TransE**: \\cite{peng2020} formally proves that TransE is a special case of LineaRE where `w1_r = w2_r`.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithm**: Introduction of LineaRE, a novel knowledge graph embedding model based on a linear regression interpretation of relations.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights**: Formal mathematical proofs demonstrating LineaRE's capability to model all four connectivity patterns (symmetry, antisymmetry, inversion, composition) and all four mapping properties (1-to-1, 1-to-N, N-to-1, N-to-N).\n    *   **Architectural Simplicity**: A simple and scalable model architecture using real-valued vectors and element-wise products, avoiding complex operations or higher-dimensional spaces.\n    *   **Unified Framework**: Provides a unified framework that encompasses and generalizes simpler models like TransE, while addressing their limitations.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: \\cite{peng2020} conducted extensive link prediction experiments.\n    *   **Datasets**: Evaluated on four widely used benchmark datasets: FB15k, WN18, FB15k-237, and WN18RR.\n    *   **Baselines**: Compared against state-of-the-art models including TransE, TransH, TransR, TransD, DistMult, ComplEx, ConvE, and RotatE.\n    *   **Performance Metrics**: Mean Rank (MR), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and Hits@k (for k=1, 3, 10) in the filtered setting.\n    *   **Key Results**:\n        *   LineaRE consistently and significantly outperformed all baseline models across all datasets and metrics.\n        *   The improvements were particularly notable on more challenging datasets like FB15k-237 and WN18RR.\n        *   **Ablation studies** confirmed the critical importance of all components of the relation representation (`w1_r`, `w2_r`, and `br`), showing significant performance drops when these components were constrained (e.g., `w1_r = w2_r` or `br = 0`).\n        *   **Case studies** provided empirical evidence of LineaRE's ability to correctly handle complex mapping properties (1-to-N, N-to-1, N-to-N) in real-world scenarios.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The paper does not explicitly state technical limitations. The model assumes that relations can be effectively approximated by linear functions in the embedding space. While powerful, this linearity might have theoretical limits in capturing extremely complex, non-linear semantic interactions if they exist beyond what the model can approximate.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: LineaRE is designed for link prediction in knowledge graphs. Its simplicity and scalability make it suitable for large-scale KGs. The model's effectiveness is demonstrated on general-purpose KGs (Freebase, WordNet subsets).\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: \\cite{peng2020} significantly advances the state-of-the-art in knowledge graph embedding for link prediction by introducing a model that is both simple and comprehensively capable of modeling diverse relation patterns and mapping properties.\n    *   **Challenging Complexity**: It demonstrates that high predictive performance and comprehensive modeling capabilities do not necessarily require complex neural architectures or complex-valued embeddings, offering a powerful and efficient alternative.\n    *   **Practical Impact**: The simplicity and scalability of LineaRE make it highly practical for real-world applications involving large and incomplete knowledge graphs, where computational efficiency is crucial.\n    *   **Future Research**: The work opens avenues for further exploration into the expressive power of linear models and their variants for knowledge graph reasoning and completion tasks.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding, which projects symbolic entities and relations into continuous vector spaces, is gaining increasing attention. Previous methods allow a single static embedding for each entity or relation, ignoring their intrinsic contextual nature, i.e., entities and relations may appear in different graph contexts, and accordingly, exhibit different properties. This work presents Contextualized Knowledge Graph Embedding (CoKE), a novel paradigm that takes into account such contextual nature, and learns dynamic, flexible, and fully contextualized entity and relation embeddings. Two types of graph contexts are studied: edges and paths, both formulated as sequences of entities and relations. CoKE takes a sequence as input and uses a Transformer encoder to obtain contextualized representations. These representations are hence naturally adaptive to the input, capturing contextual meanings of entities and relations therein. Evaluation on a wide variety of public benchmarks verifies the superiority of CoKE in link prediction and path query answering. It performs consistently better than, or at least equally well as current state-of-the-art in almost every case, in particular offering an absolute improvement of 19.7% in H@10 on path query answering.

For instance, \"Barack Obama\" has distinct political and family roles, and the relation \"HasPart\" can imply composition or location. Learning dynamic representations that capture these context-dependent meanings is a significant and challenging problem for KGE.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches:**\n        *   **Traditional KGE:** Most models learn static, global representations solely from individual subject-relation-object triples (e.g., TransE, ComplEx).\n        *   **Beyond Triples:** Some methods incorporate richer graph structures like multi-hop paths or k-degree neighborhoods, but *still learn static global representations* for entities/relations.\n        *   **Previous Notions of Context:** Earlier work touched upon related phenomena, such as relation-specific entity projections (to handle 1-to-N relations) or polysemous relations (modeled as mixtures of Gaussians).\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n        *   They fail to learn *dynamic, fully contextualized* representations where an entity's or relation's embedding adapts to its specific input graph context.\n        *   Previous \"contextual\" approaches were limited (e.g., relation-specific projections are static per relation, not dynamic per instance) and lacked a formal discussion of the intrinsic contextual nature of KGs.\n        *   While inspired by contextualized word embeddings, most graph embedding methods drawing from NLP still produce static embeddings.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** CoKE models entity and relation representations as a function of their *individual graph context*. It unifies graph contexts (edges and paths) as sequences of entities and relations. A stack of Transformer encoder blocks is then used to process these sequences.\n        *   Input representations for each element (`x_i`) in a sequence are formed by summing an element embedding (`x_ele_i`) and a position embedding (`x_pos_i`).\n        *   The Transformer's multi-head self-attention mechanism allows each element to attend to all other elements in the sequence, effectively capturing contextual dependencies.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:**\n        *   **Dynamic, Contextualized Embeddings:** Unlike static embeddings, CoKE's representations are naturally adaptive to the input sequence, capturing the specific contextual meanings of entities and relations within that sequence.\n        *   **Sequence-based Context Modeling:** Formulating edges and paths as sequences allows leveraging powerful sequence modeling architectures like Transformer, inspired by advancements in contextualized word embeddings.\n        *   **Unified Training Task:** The model is trained via an entity prediction task (predicting a masked entity in an edge or path sequence), which directly aligns with downstream tasks like link prediction and path query answering, avoiding training-test discrepancy.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Paradigm:** Introduction of the concept of \"contextualized Knowledge Graph Embedding\" to explicitly address the dynamic, context-dependent nature of entities and relations in KGs \\cite{wang2019}.\n    *   **Algorithmic Innovation:** Devising CoKE, which leverages Transformer encoders to learn dynamic, flexible, and fully contextualized embeddings by treating graph contexts (edges and paths) as input sequences \\cite{wang2019}.\n    *   **System Design:** A unified framework that processes both single-hop (edges) and multi-hop (paths) contexts as sequences, enabling a consistent training and evaluation methodology for various KG tasks \\cite{wang2019}.\n    *   **Training Strategy:** An entity prediction task that directly mirrors downstream applications, ensuring learned representations are highly relevant and effective for tasks like link prediction and path query answering \\cite{wang2019}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:**\n        *   **Link Prediction:** Completing missing entities in triples (`?!r!o` or `s!r!?`).\n        *   **Path Query Answering:** Answering multi-hop queries (`s!r1!...!rk!?`).\n        *   **Parameter Efficiency Analysis:** Comparison of parameter counts with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.\n        *   **Visualization:** Demonstrating CoKE's ability to discern fine-grained contextual meanings.\n    *   **Datasets:** Four widely used benchmarks: FB15k, WN18, FB15k-237, and WN18RR.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics:** Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hits@n (H@1, H@3, H@10) in a filtered setting.\n    *   **Comparison Results:**\n        *   **Link Prediction:** CoKE consistently outperforms or performs equally well as current SOTA methods (e.g., RotatE, TuckER, ConvR) on three out of four datasets (FB15k, FB15k-237, WN18RR) across almost all metrics, and achieves near-best results on WN18. It demonstrates superior stability compared to baselines.\n        *   **Path Query Answering:** Achieves a significant absolute improvement of up to 21.0% in H@10, highlighting its superior capability for multi-hop reasoning.\n        *   **Parameter Efficiency:** CoKE is parameter-efficient, achieving better or comparable results with fewer parameters than SOTA models like RotatE and TuckER, partly due to its ability to work well with a smaller embedding size (D=256).\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations:**\n        *   The current path formulation excludes intermediate entities from the path components, focusing on relations between the start and end entities. This simplifies the relationship to Horn clauses but might limit the richness of path contexts.\n        *   The model's maximum sequence length `K` for paths is a hyperparameter, which might limit the length of paths it can effectively model without increased computational cost.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:**\n        *   Primarily focused on structured graph contexts (edges and paths).\n        *   Applicable to tasks that can be framed as entity prediction within a sequence, such as link prediction and path query answering.\n        *   The approach is generalizable to other sequence-based graph contexts, but the paper specifically investigates edges and paths.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art:** CoKE establishes new state-of-the-art results in link prediction on several benchmarks and significantly improves performance in multi-hop path query answering, demonstrating superior reasoning capabilities.\n    *   **Paradigm Shift:** Introduces a novel paradigm for KG embedding by explicitly modeling the contextual nature of entities and relations, moving beyond static representations. This aligns KG embedding more closely with advancements in contextualized representations in NLP.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:**\n        *   Opens avenues for exploring more complex graph contexts (e.g., subgraphs, temporal contexts) using sequence-based or other context-aware neural architectures.\n        *   Encourages the development of KG embedding models that are more sensitive to the nuanced meanings of entities and relations in different scenarios.\n        *   The parameter efficiency of CoKE, despite using a Transformer, suggests that powerful contextual models can be developed without excessive computational overhead, making them practical for large KGs.\n        *   The success in path query answering highlights its potential for advanced knowledge graph reasoning and question answering systems.",

Despite such efforts, it is well known that even the largest KGs suffer from incompleteness; Link Prediction (LP) techniques address this issue by identifying missing facts among entities already in the KG. Among the recent LP techniques, those based on KG embeddings have achieved very promising performance in some benchmarks. Despite the fast-growing literature on the subject, insufficient attention has been paid to the effect of the design choices in those methods. Moreover, the standard practice in this area is to report accuracy by aggregating over a large number of test facts in which some entities are vastly more represented than others; this allows LP methods to exhibit good results by just attending to structural properties that include such entities, while ignoring the remaining majority of the KG. This analysis provides a comprehensive comparison of embedding-based LP methods, extending the dimensions of analysis beyond what is commonly available in the literature. We experimentally compare the effectiveness and efficiency of 18 state-of-the-art methods, consider a rule-based baseline, and report detailed analysis over the most popular benchmarks in the literature.",

Unlike other existing designs, the system operates on multiple embedding spaces, which use various embedding methods and queries the embedding spaces in parallel. With the answers returned from multiple embedding spaces, the system leverages a score alignment model to adjust the answer scores and rerank the answers. Further, the system implements an algorithm to derive implicit multihop relations to handle the complexities of deep ontologies and improve multihop question answering. The system also implements a BERT-based bidirectional entity-linking model to enhance the robustness and accuracy of the entity-linking module. The system uses a joint numerical embedding model to efficiently handle numerical filtering questions. Further, it can invoke semantic agents to perform dynamic calculations autonomously. Finally, the KGQA system handles numerous chemical reaction mechanisms using semantic parsing supported by a Linked Data Fragment server.

In this regard, we propose ATiSE, a temporal KG embedding model which incorporates time information into entity/relation representations by using Additive Time Series decomposition. Moreover, considering the temporal uncertainty during the evolution of entity/relation representations over time, we map the representations of temporal KGs into the space of multi-dimensional Gaussian distributions. The mean of each entity/relation embedding at a time step shows the current expected position, whereas its covariance (which is temporally stationary) represents its temporal uncertainty.

This leads to limitations in reasoning over Temporal KGs (TKGs).\n    *   **Importance & Challenge**: Temporal information is crucial for accurate KG reasoning (e.g., distinguishing `(Obama, presidentOf, USA)` in 2010 vs. 2020). Existing temporal KGE models often represent time as a simple vector, which cannot capture properties like time interval length or the inherent *uncertainty* in how entity/relation representations evolve over time (e.g., sudden, unpredictable changes).\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**:\n        *   **Static KGEs (e.g., TransE, DistMult, ComplEx, RotatE, QuatE)**: These models ignore time, treating `(s,p,o,t1)` and `(s,p,o,t2)` identically, which is problematic for temporal facts.\n        *   **Previous Temporal KGEs (e.g., TTransE, HyTE, TA-TransE, TA-DistMult, DE-SimplE, Know-Evolve)**: These models attempt to incorporate time, often by embedding time as a vector or using RNNs.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   Most existing TKGEs fail to capture complex temporal properties like the length of time intervals or the order of time points.\n        *   A critical limitation is their ignorance of *temporal uncertainty* during the evolution of entity/relation representations, assuming deterministic changes.\n        *   Some models (e.g., TA-TransE, TA-DistMult, DE-SimplE) cannot effectively model facts involving time intervals `[ts, te]`.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**:\n        *   **Additive Time Series Decomposition**: \\cite{xu2019} proposes ATiSE (Additive Time Series Embedding), which models the evolution of each entity and relation representation as a multi-dimensional additive time series: `Yt = Tt + St + Rt` (Trend + Seasonal + Random components).\n        *   **Gaussian Distribution Embeddings**: Each entity and relation is represented as a *multi-dimensional Gaussian distribution* at each time step `t`.\n            *   The *mean vector* (`es,t`, `rp,t`, `eo,t`) captures the expected position, derived from an initial representation, a linear trend component, and a sine-based seasonal component.\n            *   The *covariance matrix* (`\u03a3s`, `\u03a3r`, `\u03a3o`) explicitly represents the *temporal uncertainty* during evolution, modeled as a constant diagonal matrix for computational efficiency.\n        *   **Score Function**: A *symmetric KL-divergence* is used to measure the similarity between the relation's Gaussian distribution (`Pr,t`) and the entity-transformed Gaussian distribution (`Pe,t = N(es,t - eo,t, \u03a3s + \u03a3o)`) to score a fact `(s,p,o,t)`.\n    *   **Novelty or Difference**:\n        *   **First to use Additive Time Series Decomposition**: This is a novel application of time series analysis to model the dynamic evolution of KG embeddings, establishing a new connection between relational processes and time series.\n        *   **Explicit Modeling of Temporal Uncertainty**: By representing entities/relations as Gaussian distributions, ATiSE explicitly accounts for the inherent randomness and uncertainty in their temporal evolution, a significant departure from deterministic approaches.\n        *   **Efficient Gaussian Embedding**: The use of constant diagonal covariance matrices and a symmetric KL-divergence allows for efficient computation while still capturing uncertainty.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**:\n        *   Introduction of ATiSE, a temporal KG embedding model based on additive time series decomposition for entity and relation representations.\n        *   Modeling of entity and relation embeddings as multi-dimensional Gaussian distributions to capture temporal uncertainty, with means evolving via trend and seasonal components.\n        *   Development of a symmetric KL-divergence-based score function for facts in this Gaussian embedding space.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: Established a novel connection between relational processes in KGs and time series analysis, opening new avenues for research in temporal reasoning.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: \\cite{xu2019} compared ATiSE against several state-of-the-art static KGE models (TransE, DistMult, ComplEx, RotatE, QuatE) and existing temporal KGE models (TTransE, HyTE, TA-TransE, TA-DistMult, DE-SimplE) on the task of link prediction. An ablation study was also performed to analyze component effects.\n    *   **Datasets**: Experiments were conducted on four temporal KG datasets: ICEWS14, ICEWS05-15, YAGO11k, and Wikidata12k.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results**: ATiSE \"significantly outperforms\" all compared state-of-the-art KGE models and existing temporal KGE models on link prediction across all four temporal KG datasets \\cite{xu2019}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The model assumes diagonal and temporally stationary (constant) covariance matrices for computational efficiency, which might simplify the true complexity of uncertainty.

        "abstract": "Embedding knowledge graphs into low-dimensional spaces is a popular method for applying approaches, such as link prediction or node classification, to these databases. This embedding process is very costly in terms of both computational time and space. Part of the reason for this is the optimisation of hyperparameters, which involves repeatedly sampling, by random, guided, or brute-force selection, from a large hyperparameter space and testing the resulting embeddings for their quality. However, not all hyperparameters in this search space will be equally important. In fact, with prior knowledge of the relative importance of the hyperparameters, some could be eliminated from the search altogether without significantly impacting the overall quality of the outputted embeddings. To this end, we ran a Sobol sensitivity analysis to evaluate the effects of tuning different hyperparameters on the variance of embedding quality. This was achieved by performing thousands of embedding trials, each time measuring the quality of embeddings produced by different hyperparameter configurations. We regressed the embedding quality on those hyperparameter configurations, using this model to generate Sobol sensitivity indices for each of the hyperparameters. By evaluating the correlation between Sobol indices, we find substantial variability in the hyperparameter sensitivities between knowledge graphs with differing dataset characteristics as the probable cause of these inconsistencies. As an additional contribution of this work we identify several relations in the UMLS knowledge graph that may cause data leakage via inverse relations, and derive and present UMLS-43, a leakage-robust variant of that graph.",

        "summary": "Here is a focused summary of the empirical study by \\cite{lloyd2022} for a literature review:\n\n1.  **Research Questions & Hypotheses**\n    This study empirically investigates the relative importance of hyperparameters in knowledge graph embedding (KGE) quality. It aims to determine how tuning different hyperparameters affects the variance of embedding quality and if this importance varies across different knowledge graphs. The implicit hypothesis is that not all hyperparameters contribute equally to embedding quality, and their impact is dataset-dependent.\n\n2.  **Study Design & Methodology**\n    The study employed an experimental design involving tens of thousands of KGE trials across various datasets and methods. Data collection involved running 13,450 embedding trials with hyperparameter values chosen by Sobol sequence. A Sobol sensitivity analysis was then performed on linear regression models, which regressed embedding quality (measured by MRR) on hyperparameter configurations.\n\n3.  **Data & Participants**\n    The study utilized three well-known benchmark knowledge graphs: FB15k-237, UMLS, and WN18RR, which vary in node count, edge count, density, and other structural characteristics. A total of 13,450 embedding trials were successfully completed across 167 valid jobs, using various KGE methods available in the LibKGE library.\n\n4.  **Key Empirical Findings**\n    *   There is substantial variability in hyperparameter sensitivities between knowledge graphs, suggesting that optimal tuning strategies are dataset-specific.\n    *   Differing dataset characteristics, such as graph density and node degree distribution, are identified as probable causes for these inconsistencies in hyperparameter importance.\n    *   The UMLS dataset consistently yielded higher Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) scores compared to FB15k-237 and WN18RR, indicating it presents an \"easier\" link prediction problem.\n    *   The authors identified several inverse relations in the UMLS knowledge graph (e.g., 'degree_of', 'precedes', 'derivative_of') that could cause data leakage, leading to the derivation of UMLS-43, a leakage-robust variant.\n\n5.  **Statistical Analysis**\n    For each knowledge graph, the top 5% of trials by embedding quality had their MRR scores regressed on corresponding hyperparameter configurations using linear regression. A Sobol sensitivity analysis was then applied to these models to calculate first-order, second-order, and total-order Sobol indices, indicating the proportion of output variance attributable to individual inputs or their interactions. Pairwise Pearson's correlation was used to quantify agreement between sensitivities across datasets.\n\n6.  **Validity & Limitations**\n    A limitation is that the MRR metric used for embedding quality does not allow for direct comparisons of quality *between* different knowledge graphs, only within them. Additionally, some KGE methods (e.g., RotatE, TransH) failed to complete trials on larger datasets, potentially due to computational demands or implementation inefficiencies.\n\n7.  **Empirical Contribution**\n    This study provides novel empirical evidence on the varying importance of KGE hyperparameters across diverse knowledge graphs, which can inform more efficient and targeted hyperparameter tuning strategies. It also contributes UMLS-43, a new leakage-robust variant of the UMLS knowledge graph, enhancing its utility for future research.",

Meanwhile, knowledge embedded into vector space can imply more meanings. Much real-world information, however, is often uncertain and dynamic. Existing KG embedding (KGE) models are insufficient to deal with uncertain dynamic knowledge in vector spaces. To overcome this drawback, this article concentrates on an embedding module for the distributed representation of uncertain dynamic knowledge and proposes a strongly adaptive fuzzy spatiotemporal RDF embedding model (FSTRE). Specifically, we first propose a fine-grained fuzzy spatiotemporal RDF model, which provides the underlying representation framework for FSTRE. Then, within the complex vector space, spatial and temporal information is embedded by projection and rotation, respectively. Fine-grained fuzziness penetrates each element of the spatiotemporal five-tuples by a modal length of the anisotropic vectors. By using geometric operations as its transformation operator, FSTRE can capture the rich interaction between crisp and static knowledge and fuzzy spatiotemporal knowledge. We performed an experimental evaluation of FSTRE based on the built fuzzy spatiotemporal KG. It was shown that our FSTRE model is superior to state-of-the-art methods and can handle complex fuzzy spatiotemporal knowledge.",

Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and graph attention networks (GATs) have been widely used in KGC tasks by capturing neighbor information of entities. However, Both GCNs and GATs based KGC models have their limitations, and the best method is to analyze the neighbors of each entity (pre-validating), while this process is prohibitively expensive. Furthermore, the representation quality of the embeddings can affect the aggregation of neighbor information (message passing). To address the above limitations, we propose a novel knowledge graph completion model with mixed geometry message and trainable convolutional attention network named MGTCA. Concretely, the mixed geometry message function generates rich neighbor message by integrating spatially information in the hyperbolic space, hypersphere space and Euclidean space jointly. To complete the autonomous switching of graph neural networks (GNNs) and eliminate the necessity of pre-validating the local structure of KGs, a trainable convolutional attention network is proposed by comprising three types of GNNs in one trainable formulation. Furthermore, a mixed geometry scoring function is proposed, which calculates scores of triples by novel prediction function and similarity function based on different geometric spaces.

Using the self-attention (SA) mechanism in Transformer to model the subject-relation-object triples in KGs suffers from training inconsistency as SA is invariant to the order of input tokens. As a result, it is unable to distinguish a (real) relation triple from its shuffled (fake) variants (e.g., object-relation-subject) and, thus, fails to capture the correct semantics. To cope with this issue, we propose a novel Transformer architecture, namely, Knowformer, for KG embedding. It incorporates relational compositions in entity representations to explicitly inject semantics and capture the role of an entity based on its position (subject or object) in a relation triple. The relational composition for a subject (or object) entity of a relation triple refers to an operator on the relation and the object (or subject). We borrow ideas from the typical translational and semantic-matching embedding techniques to design relational compositions. We carefully design a residual block to integrate relational compositions into SA and efficiently propagate the composed relational semantics layer by layer. We formally prove that the SA with relational compositions is able to distinguish the entity roles in different positions and correctly capture relational semantics. Extensive experiments and analyses on six benchmark datasets show that Knowformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on both link prediction and entity alignment.",

The conventional shallow models are limited to their expressiveness. ConvE (Dettmers et al., 2018) takes advantage of CNN and improves the expressive power with parameter efficient operators by increasing the interactions between head and relation embeddings. However, there is no structural information in the embedding space of ConvE, and the performance is still limited by the number of interactions. The recent KBGAT (Nathani et al., 2019) provides another way to learn embeddings by adaptively utilizing structural information. In this paper, we take the benefits of ConvE and KBGAT together and propose a Relation-aware Inception network with joint local-global structural information for knowledge graph Embedding (ReInceptionE). Specifically, we first explore the Inception network to learn query embedding, which aims to further increase the interactions between head and relation embeddings. Then, we propose to use a relation-aware attention mechanism to enrich the query embedding with the local neighborhood and global entity information. Experimental results on both WN18RR and FB15k-237 datasets demonstrate that ReInceptionE achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

Related Work & Positioning**\n*   **Existing Approaches**:\n    *   **Conventional shallow models**: Identified as having limited expressiveness.\n    *   **ConvE (Dettmers et al., 2018)**: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to increase interactions between head and relation embeddings, offering parameter-efficient expressiveness.\n    *   **KBGAT (Nathani et al., 2019)**: Learns embeddings by adaptively leveraging structural information within the knowledge graph.\n*   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n    *   ConvE lacks structural information in its embedding space, and its performance is limited by the number of interactions it can capture.\n    *   Shallow models are inherently limited in their expressive power.\n\n**3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n*   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes ReInceptionE \\cite{xie2020}, a novel model that integrates the benefits of ConvE (enhanced interaction) and KBGAT (structural information).\n    *   **Inception Network for Query Embedding**: An Inception network is employed to learn query embeddings, specifically designed to further increase the interactions between head and relation embeddings.\n    *   **Relation-aware Attention Mechanism**: A novel attention mechanism is introduced to enrich the query embedding by incorporating both local neighborhood and global entity information from the knowledge graph structure.\n*   **Novelty**: ReInceptionE \\cite{xie2020} is novel in its synergistic combination of an Inception network for deep interaction learning and a relation-aware attention mechanism for integrating comprehensive structural context (local and global) into KGE.\n\n**4. Key Technical Contributions**\n*   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**:\n    *   The application of an Inception network architecture to enhance the learning of interactions between head and relation embeddings for KGE.\n    *   The development of a relation-aware attention mechanism that effectively enriches query embeddings with both local neighborhood and global entity structural information.\n*   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: A unified architecture, ReInceptionE \\cite{xie2020}, that combines these two distinct mechanisms to overcome the limitations of prior KGE models by simultaneously improving interaction learning and structural awareness.\n\n**5. Experimental Validation**\n*   **Experiments Conducted**: The proposed ReInceptionE \\cite{xie2020} model was evaluated against state-of-the-art methods.\n*   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results**: Experiments were conducted on two widely used benchmark datasets: WN18RR and FB15k-237. The results demonstrate that ReInceptionE \\cite{xie2020} achieves competitive performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.\n\n**6. Limitations & Scope**\n*   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The provided abstract does not explicitly state specific technical limitations or assumptions of ReInceptionE \\cite{xie2020}.\n*   **Scope of Applicability**: The model is primarily applicable to knowledge graph embedding tasks, particularly for scenarios requiring highly expressive embeddings that capture both intricate interactions and rich structural context.\n\n**7. Technical Significance**\n*   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: ReInceptionE \\cite{xie2020} advances the technical state-of-the-art in KGE by providing a more comprehensive and powerful framework that addresses the shortcomings of previous models, specifically by integrating enhanced interaction learning with explicit structural information.\n*   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: This work highlights the benefits of combining advanced neural network architectures (like Inception) with attention mechanisms for structural awareness in KGE. It could inspire future research into hybrid models that leverage diverse architectural strengths to learn richer and more robust knowledge graph representations, potentially improving performance in downstream tasks such as link prediction, knowledge graph completion, and question answering.",

These mathematically-inspired models are not only highly scalable for inference in large KGs, but also have many explainable advantages in modeling different relation patterns that can be validated through both formal proofs and empirical results. In this paper, we make a comprehensive overview of the current state of research in KG completion. In particular, we focus on two main branches of KG embedding (KGE) design: 1) distance-based methods and 2) semantic matching-based methods. We discover the connections between recently proposed models and present an underlying trend that might help researchers invent novel and more effective models. Next, we delve into CompoundE and CompoundE3D, which draw inspiration from 2D and 3D affine operations, respectively. They encompass a broad spectrum of techniques including distance-based and semantic-based methods. We will also discuss an emerging approach for KG completion which leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) and textual descriptions of entities and relations and offer insights into the integration of KGE embedding methods with PLMs for KG completion.",

Since they store many facts, they are regarded as core resources for many natural language processing tasks. Nevertheless, they are not normally complete and have many missing facts. Such missing facts keep them from being used in diverse applications in spite of their usefulness. Therefore, it is significant to complete knowledge bases. Knowledge graph embedding is one of the promising approaches to completing a knowledge base and thus many variants of knowledge graph embedding have been proposed. It maps all entities and relations in knowledge base onto a low dimensional vector space. Then, candidate facts that are plausible in the space are determined as missing facts. However, any single knowledge graph embedding is insufficient to complete a knowledge base. As a solution to this problem, this paper defines knowledge base completion as a ranking task and proposes a committee-based knowledge graph embedding model for improving the performance of knowledge base completion. Since each knowledge graph embedding has its own idiosyncrasy, we make up a committee of various knowledge graph embeddings to reflect various perspectives. After ranking all candidate facts according to their plausibility computed by the committee, the top-k facts are chosen as missing facts. Our experimental results on two data sets show that the proposed model achieves higher performance than any single knowledge graph embedding and shows robust performances regardless of k. These results prove that the proposed model considers various perspectives in measuring the plausibility of candidate facts.",

        "abstract": "Question answering over knowledge graph (QA-KG) aims to use facts in the knowledge graph (KG) to answer natural language questions. It helps end users more efficiently and more easily access the substantial and valuable knowledge in the KG, without knowing its data structures. QA-KG is a nontrivial problem since capturing the semantic meaning of natural language is difficult for a machine. Meanwhile, many knowledge graph embedding methods have been proposed. The key idea is to represent each predicate/entity as a low-dimensional vector, such that the relation information in the KG could be preserved. The learned vectors could benefit various applications such as KG completion and recommender systems. In this paper, we explore to use them to handle the QA-KG problem. However, this remains a challenging task since a predicate could be expressed in different ways in natural language questions. Also, the ambiguity of entity names and partial names makes the number of possible answers large. To bridge the gap, we propose an effective Knowledge Embedding based Question Answering (KEQA) framework. We focus on answering the most common types of questions, i.e., simple questions, in which each question could be answered by the machine straightforwardly if its single head entity and single predicate are correctly identified. To answer a simple question, instead of inferring its head entity and predicate directly, KEQA targets at jointly recovering the question's head entity, predicate, and tail entity representations in the KG embedding spaces. Based on a carefully-designed joint distance metric, the three learned vectors' closest fact in the KG is returned as the answer. Experiments on a widely-adopted benchmark demonstrate that the proposed KEQA outperforms the state-of-the-art QA-KG methods.",

This paper proposes an innovative Convolutional Neural Network-based Entity-specific Common Feature Aggregation strategy named CNN-ECFA. Besides, a new universal framework based on the CNN-ECFA strategy is introduced for knowledge graph embedding learning. Experiments are conducted on publicly-available standard datasets for a link prediction task including WN18RR, YAGO3-10 and NELL-995. Results show that the CNN-ECFA strategy outperforms the state-of-the-art feature projection strategies with average improvements of 0.6% and 0.7% of MRR and Hits@1 on all the datasets, demonstrating our CNN-ECFA strategy is more effective for knowledge graph embedding learning. In addition, our universal framework significantly outperforms a generalized relation learning framework on WN18RR and NELL-995 with average improvements of 1.7% and 1.9% on MRR and Hits@1.

However, performing multihop query modeling on incomplete fuzzy spatiotemporal knowledge graphs (KGs) poses significant challenges. Recently, embedding-based multihop KG querying approaches have gained attention. Yet, these approaches often overlook KG uncertainty and spatiotemporal sensitivity, resulting in the neglect of fuzzy spatiotemporal information during multihop path reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose an embedding-based multihop query model for fuzzy spatiotemporal KG. We use quaternion to jointly embed spatiotemporal entities, and relations are represented as rotations from spatiotemporal subject to object. We incorporate uncertainty by the scoring function's bias factor, allowing for relaxation embedding. This approach facilitates the learning of a richer representation of fuzzy spatiotemporal KGs in vector space. By exploiting the inherent noncommutative compositional pattern of quaternions, we construct more accurate multihop paths within fuzzy spatiotemporal KGs, thus improving path reasoning performance. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct experiments on two fuzzy spatiotemporal KG datasets, focusing on link prediction and path query answering. Results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines in terms of performance metrics.",

        "abstract": "Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding (CKGE) aims to efficiently learn new knowledge and simultaneously preserve old knowledge. Dominant approaches primarily focus on alleviating catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge but neglect efficient learning for the emergence of new knowledge. However, in real-world scenarios, knowledge graphs (KGs) are continuously growing, which brings a significant challenge to fine-tuning KGE models efficiently. To address this issue, we propose a fast CKGE framework (FastKGE), incorporating an incremental low-rank adapter (IncLoRA) mechanism to efficiently acquire new knowledge while preserving old knowledge. Specifically, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, FastKGE isolates and allocates new knowledge to specific layers based on the fine-grained influence between old and new KGs. Subsequently, to accelerate fine-tuning, FastKGE devises an efficient IncLoRA mechanism, which embeds the specific layers into incremental low-rank adapters with fewer training parameters. Moreover, IncLoRA introduces adaptive rank allocation, which makes the LoRA aware of the importance of entities and adjusts its rank scale adaptively. We conduct experiments on four public datasets and two new datasets with a larger initial scale. Experimental results demonstrate that FastKGE can reduce training time by 34%-49% while still achieving competitive link prediction performance against state-of-the-art models on four public datasets (average MRR score of 21.0% vs. 21.1%). Meanwhile, on two newly constructed datasets, FastKGE saves 51%-68% training time and improves link prediction performance by 1.5%.",

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \"Fast and Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding via Incremental LoRA\" by Liu et al. for a literature review:\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of \"Fast and Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding via Incremental LoRA\" \\cite{liu2024}\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the challenge of Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding (CKGE), which involves efficiently learning new knowledge in evolving Knowledge Graphs (KGs) while simultaneously preserving previously learned old knowledge.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: Real-world KGs are continuously growing (e.g., Wikidata), making traditional KGE methods that require retraining the entire KG prohibitively expensive. Existing CKGE approaches primarily focus on mitigating catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge but often neglect the efficiency of learning new knowledge, leading to significant training costs, especially with large-scale KGs.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**:\n        *   **Full-parameter fine-tuning methods**: These approaches (e.g., replay-based like GEM, EMR, DiCGRL, or regularization-based like SI, EWC, LKGE) effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting but incur high training costs due to updating all parameters or replaying old data.\n        *   **Incremental-parameter fine-tuning methods**: These methods (e.g., PNN, CWR) adapt architectural properties to accommodate new information with fewer parameters but can still lead to unacceptable increases in parameters and training time due to straightforward alignment of new and old parameter dimensions.\n        *   **Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA) in LLMs**: `\\cite{liu2024}` is inspired by LoRA's success in efficiently fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) by injecting trainable low-rank decomposition matrices.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Prior CKGE methods largely overlook training efficiency when KGs evolve. While LoRA has been used in LLMs and for general continual learning to alleviate forgetting, its application to the specific challenges of CKGE (especially efficient learning of new KG knowledge) is novel.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: `\\cite{liu2024}` proposes **FastKGE**, a fast CKGE framework that incorporates an **Incremental Low-Rank Adapter (IncLoRA)** mechanism. The framework operates in three stages:\n        1.  **Graph Layering**: New entities and relations are divided into distinct layers based on their importance, determined by their distance from the old KG (using BFS) and degree centrality within the new triples. This isolates new knowledge to specific layers.\n        2.  **IncLoRA Learning**: Embeddings for entities and relations in each layer are represented by incremental low-rank adapters (Ak, Bk). This significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters.\n        3.  **Link Predicting**: All learned LoRA groups from current and previous snapshots are concatenated with original embeddings for inference, with no additional time consumption during prediction.\n    *   **Novelty/Differentiation**:\n        *   **First to introduce LoRA to CKGE**: `\\cite{liu2024}` innovatively adapts low-rank adapters to store new KG knowledge, reducing training costs and preserving old knowledge.\n        *   **Fine-grained knowledge isolation**: New knowledge is isolated and allocated to specific layers based on the fine-grained influence between old and new KGs (distance from old graph, degree centrality).\n        *   **Adaptive Rank Allocation**: IncLoRA introduces an adaptive rank allocation strategy. Instead of a fixed rank, more important entities (those with higher degree centrality) are assigned higher ranks in their respective LoRAs, allowing for more information preservation.\n        *   **Focus on efficiency for *new* knowledge**: While mitigating forgetting, the primary innovation lies in accelerating the acquisition of new knowledge in growing KGs.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**:\n        *   Introduction of the **IncLoRA mechanism** for Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding, enabling efficient learning and storage of new knowledge.\n        *   **Graph Layering strategy** that sorts and divides new entities into layers based on distance from the old graph and degree centrality.\n        *   **Adaptive Rank Allocation** within IncLoRA, which dynamically adjusts the rank scale of adapters based on the importance (degree centrality) of entities.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: The **FastKGE framework** integrates graph layering, incremental low-rank decomposition, and adaptive rank allocation into a cohesive system for efficient CKGE.\n    *   **New Datasets**: Construction and release of two new, larger-scale CKGE datasets, **FB-CKGE** and **WN-CKGE**, addressing the deficiency of small initial KG sizes in existing benchmarks.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Experiments were performed on four traditional CKGE datasets (ENTITY, RELATION, FACT, HYBRID) and two newly constructed datasets (FB-CKGE, WN-CKGE) with larger initial KGs. The task evaluated was link prediction.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**: Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10 were used to measure link prediction performance. Total training time across all snapshots was measured for efficiency.\n    *   **Comparison Results**:\n        *   On **four public datasets**: FastKGE reduced training time by **34%-49%** while achieving competitive link prediction performance against state-of-the-art models (average MRR score of 21.0% for FastKGE vs. 21.1% for SOTAs).\n        *   On **two newly constructed datasets (FB-CKGE, WN-CKGE)**: FastKGE saved **51%-68%** training time and *improved* link prediction performance by **1.5%** in MRR on average.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**:\n        *   The layering strategy primarily focuses on entities, with all new relations placed in a single layer, assuming entity growth is more significant.\n        *   The base KGE model used for experiments is TransE, and the generalizability to other KGE models is implied but not explicitly demonstrated for all.\n        *   The hyper-parameter `N` for the number of entity layers needs to be tuned.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: FastKGE is designed for dynamic KGs where new knowledge continuously emerges. Its primary benefit is in scenarios requiring efficient updates to KGE models without full retraining, especially for KGs with a substantial foundational graph.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: `\\cite{liu2024}` significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in CKGE by introducing a novel, parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm based on low-rank adapters. It effectively addresses the often-neglected aspect of efficient learning for new knowledge while maintaining competitive performance in mitigating catastrophic forgetting.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: This work opens new avenues for research in efficient continual learning for structured data like KGs, potentially inspiring similar low-rank adaptation techniques for other dynamic graph-based tasks. The release of larger-scale CKGE datasets also provides a more realistic benchmark for future research in this domain.",

Our approach initializes entity embeddings using \u2018in\u2019 and \u2018out\u2019 relationship matrices and refines them through a hybrid graph neural network (GNN) framework, which includes a GNN layer for local information and a hypergraph neural network (HGNN) layer for potential global information. The meta-learning strategy embedded in MetaHG effectively transfers meta-knowledge for the accurate representation of emerging entities. Extensive experiments are conducted on a self-collected clothing industry service dataset and two publicly available open-source KG datasets. By comparing with several baselines, experiment results demonstrate the superior performance of MetaHG in generating high-quality embeddings for emerging entities and dynamically updating service knowledge.",

With a large KG, the embeddings consume a large amount of storage and memory. This is problematic and prohibits the deployment of these techniques in many real world settings. Thus, we propose an approach that compresses the KG embedding layer by representing each entity in the KG as a vector of discrete codes and then composes the embeddings from these codes. The approach can be trained end-to-end with simple modifications to any existing KG embedding technique. We evaluate the approach on various standard KG embedding evaluations and show that it achieves 50-1000x compression of embeddings with a minor loss in performance. The compressed embeddings also retain the ability to perform various reasoning tasks such as KG inference.",

Recently, with the rapid development of enterprise management information systems, many research efforts and industrial practices have been devoted to building personalized employee training course recommender systems. Nevertheless, a widespread challenge is how to provide explainable recommendations with the consideration of different learning motivations from talents. To this end, we propose CKGE, a contextualized knowledge graph (KG) embedding approach for developing an explainable training course recommender system. A novel perspective of CKGE is to integrate both the contextualized neighbor semantics and high-order connections as motivation-aware information for learning effective representations of talents and courses. Specifically, in CKGE, for each entity pair (i.e., the talent-course pair), we first construct a meta-graph, including the neighbors of each entity and the meta-paths between entities as motivation-aware information. Then, we develop a novel KG-based Transformer, which can serialize entities and paths in the meta-graph as a sequential input, with the specially designed relational attention and structural encoding mechanisms to better model the global dependence of KG structured data. Meanwhile, the local path mask prediction can effectively reveal the importance of different paths. As a result, CKGE not only can make precise predictions but also can discriminate the saliencies of meta-paths in characterizing corresponding preferences. Extensive experiments on real-world and public datasets clearly validate the effectiveness and interpretability of CKGE compared with state-of-the-art baselines.",

A vast array of entity features remains unexplored or not equally treated, which impairs the accuracy and robustness of alignment \\cite{zhang2019}.\n        *   **Challenge 2 (Seed Alignment Dependency):** Existing methods heavily rely on abundant, costly seed entity alignment for training. Furthermore, they often assume the easy availability of seed relation and attribute alignment, which is not always practical \\cite{zhang2019}.\n\n*   **2. Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:**\n        *   Builds upon KG embedding techniques (e.g., TransE, DistMult, ConvE) but extends them from single-KG link prediction to cross-KG entity alignment \\cite{zhang2019}.\n        *   Relates to existing embedding-based entity alignment methods like MTransE, IPTransE, BootEA, and GCN-Align, which primarily use relational features \\cite{zhang2019}.\n        *   Compares to methods that incorporate additional features (e.g., JAPE, KDCoE, AttrE) but notes their limited scope \\cite{zhang2019}.\n        *   Leverages principles from multi-view representation learning, adapting them for KG embedding \\cite{zhang2019}.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n        *   Existing embedding-based entity alignment methods exploit only one or two types of entity features, failing to capture the full spectrum of entity characteristics and being \"incapable of incorporating new features\" \\cite{zhang2019}.\n        *   They are overly reliant on abundant and costly seed entity alignment, and often make unrealistic assumptions about the availability of seed relation and attribute alignment \\cite{zhang2019}.\n\n*   **3. Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper proposes **MultiKE**, a novel framework that unifies multiple views of entities to learn comprehensive embeddings for entity alignment \\cite{zhang2019}.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:**\n        *   **Multi-view Embedding:** MultiKE explicitly divides various KG features into complementary \"views\" (name, relation, attribute) and learns view-specific embeddings, which are then jointly optimized \\cite{zhang2019}.

Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations or Assumptions:**\n        *   The literal embedding component truncates long literals (max 5 tokens) and pads short ones \\cite{zhang2019}.\n        *   Negative sampling was not employed for the attribute view embedding, as it did not yield noticeable improvement \\cite{zhang2019}.\n        *   The \"soft alignment\" method relies on a similarity threshold `\\theta` for identifying relation/attribute alignment \\cite{zhang2019}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** Primarily focused on entity alignment between KGs where entity names, relational structures, and attribute-value pairs are available. It is particularly beneficial in scenarios with limited seed entity alignment \\cite{zhang2019}.\n\n*   **7. Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advance the Technical State-of-the-Art:** MultiKE significantly advances the state-of-the-art in embedding-based entity alignment by providing a robust framework that effectively integrates and jointly optimizes heterogeneous entity features from multiple views, outperforming prior methods \\cite{zhang2019}.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:**\n        *   Offers a flexible paradigm for incorporating diverse entity features, paving the way for more comprehensive and accurate KG embedding models.\n        *   The \"soft alignment\" mechanism for relations and attributes provides a valuable technique for reducing reliance on costly manual annotations, which could be extended to other alignment tasks.\n        *   Its success in unsupervised entity alignment suggests avenues for developing more autonomous KG integration systems.\n        *   The multi-view approach could inspire similar strategies for other KG-related tasks beyond entity alignment \\cite{zhang2019}.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs), which store an extensive number of relational facts (head, relation, tail), serve various applications. While many downstream tasks highly rely on the expressive modeling and predictive embedding of KGs, most of the current KG representation learning methods, where each entity is embedded as a vector in the Euclidean space and each relation is embedded as a transformation, follow an entity ranking protocol. On one hand, such an embedding design cannot capture many-to-many relations. On the other hand, in many retrieval cases, the users wish to get an exact set of answers without any ranking, especially when the results are expected to be precise, e.g., which genes cause an illness. Such scenarios are commonly referred to as \"set retrieval\". This work presents a pioneering study on the KG set retrieval problem. We show that the set retrieval highly depends on expressive modeling of many-to-many relations, and propose a new KG embedding model SpherE to address this problem. SpherE is based on rotational embedding methods, but each entity is embedded as a sphere instead of a vector. While inheriting the high interpretability of rotational-based models, our SpherE can more expressively model one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many relations. Through extensive experiments, we show that our SpherE can well address the set retrieval problem while still having a good predictive ability to infer missing facts.

This paper introduces and formulates the novel problem of \"Knowledge Graph Set Retrieval\" to address this gap.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:** The work builds upon rotational embedding methods like RotatE, RotatE3D, and HousE, which model relations as rotations and are known for handling symmetric and anti-symmetric relations.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n        *   **Translation-based methods (e.g., TransE, TransH):** Inexpressive for symmetric relations.\n        *   **Rotation-based methods (e.g., RotatE, QuatE):** While good for symmetry, they embed entities as vectors (points), making them inexpressive for one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many relations.\n        *   **Complex models (e.g., BoxE, HousE):** Achieve high expressiveness but often at the cost of interpretability due to their intricate modeling.\n        *   **All existing KGE methods:** Primarily focus on entity ranking, which is unsuitable for \"set retrieval\" tasks requiring precise, unranked sets of answers.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method:** The paper proposes SpherE, a novel KGE model that embeds each entity as a *sphere* (defined by a center vector and a radius) in a Euclidean space, while relations are modeled as *rotations*.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:**\n        *   **Sphere-based Entity Embedding:** Unlike traditional KGE models that embed entities as points (vectors), SpherE uses spheres. This allows for a natural representation of \"universality\" (how often an entity appears) through the sphere's radius.\n        *   **Set Retrieval Paradigm:** SpherE directly addresses the set retrieval problem by defining a triple `(h, r, t)` as true if the sphere of the transformed head entity `f_r(c_h)` *overlaps* (is non-disjoint) with the sphere of the tail entity `c_t`. This inherently supports multiple correct answers without requiring a ranking threshold.\n        *   **Expressiveness for Many-to-Many Relations:** The sphere-based modeling naturally captures one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many relations, as a single transformed head sphere can overlap with multiple tail spheres.\n        *   **Interpretability:** SpherE inherits the interpretability of rotational models, and the entity radius provides an intuitive measure of an entity's \"universality\" or prevalence in the KG.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Problem Formulation:** First to introduce and formally define the \"Knowledge Graph Set Retrieval\" problem.\n    *   **Novel Embedding Model (SpherE):** Proposes embedding entities as spheres and relations as rotations, enabling direct set retrieval.\n    *   **Theoretical Expressiveness:** Provides theoretical proofs (Theorems 3.1, 3.2, 3.3) demonstrating SpherE's ability to model various inference patterns, including symmetry, anti-symmetry, inversion, composition, non-commutative composition (for k>=3D), multiplicity (for k>=3D), and all relation mapping properties (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many).\n    *   **Interpretable Radius:** The entity radius is shown to correlate with the entity's occurrence frequency in the KG, providing a clear interpretation of its learned parameter.\n    *   **Specialized Loss Function:** Designs a sigmoid-based loss function that encourages sphere intersection for positive triples and disjointness for negative triples, incorporating hyperparameters `alpha` and `beta` to fine-tune intersection behavior.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** Evaluated SpherE on two widely-used KGE benchmark datasets: FB15K237 and WN18RR.\n    *   **Baselines:** Compared against state-of-the-art rotational KGE methods (RotatE, RotatE3D, HousE-kD) adapted for set retrieval by truncating their ranked lists at various `top-l` cutoffs (l=1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 100).\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics:**\n        *   **F1 Score:** Measures the accuracy of the retrieved set against the ground truth set (Head F1, Tail F1).\n        *   **Retrieve Rate (RR):** Probability that the actual correct entity for a test triple is included in the retrieved set, indicating link prediction ability (Head RR, Tail RR).\n        *   **n-to-n F1:** F1 score specifically for many-to-many relations.\n    *   **Comparison Results:**\n        *   SpherE significantly *outperforms all baseline methods* in terms of Head F1, Tail F1, and especially n-to-n F1 on both datasets, demonstrating its superior ability for set retrieval and modeling many-to-many relations.\n        *   SpherE maintains a *comparable \"Retrieve Rate\"* (RR) to strong baselines (e.g., top-20 for FB15K237, top-3 for WN18RR), indicating it still has good predictive ability for inferring missing links.\n        *   The experiments empirically validate the interpretability of the radius, showing a positive correlation between an entity's radius and its occurrence count in the KG.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations:** The paper notes an observed performance drop in set retrieval tasks as the dimension of rotation (`k` in SpherE-kD) increases, suggesting an area for future investigation.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** SpherE is primarily designed for knowledge graph set retrieval tasks where precise, unranked sets of answers are required. While it also shows good link prediction capabilities, its core innovation lies in the set retrieval paradigm.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** \\cite{li2024} makes a pioneering contribution by formally introducing and addressing the Knowledge Graph Set Retrieval problem, shifting the paradigm from entity ranking to direct set prediction.\n    *   **Potential Impact:**\n        *   **Enhanced KG Utility:** Enables more precise and user-friendly information retrieval from KGs, particularly in domains like bioinformatics, legal research, or any application requiring exact sets of related entities.\n        *   **New Research Direction:** Opens up a new avenue for KGE research focused on set-based predictions rather than solely ranking, potentially leading to more expressive and application-specific embedding models.\n        *   **Interpretable Models:** The sphere-based entity representation with an interpretable radius offers a more intuitive understanding of entity properties within the embedding space.",

It also draws inspiration from disentangled representation learning applied in other domains (e.g., text, images, homogeneous graphs).\n    *   **Limitations of previous solutions:**\n        *   Even GNN-based KGC models learn *static representations*, which inherently limit their flexibility and expressiveness when dealing with complex relation types.\n        *   While some methods (e.g., relation-specific projections, Transformers) attempt to capture dynamic representations, there has been little formal discussion or dedicated work on *disentangled representation learning* specifically for investigating latent factors within knowledge graphs.\n        *   Previous disentangled graph learning efforts (e.g., DisenGCN) often focused on homogeneous networks and sometimes lacked explicit mechanisms for *macro-separability* (ensuring independence between learned components), which is crucial for complex KGs.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core technical method:** DisenKGAT (Disentangled Knowledge Graph Attention Network) is an end-to-end deep model designed to learn disentangled entity representations by incorporating both *micro-disentanglement* and *macro-disentanglement* \\cite{wu2021}.\n    *   **Micro-disentanglement:** Achieved through a novel *relation-aware aggregation* mechanism. For each entity and its `k`-th component, the model dynamically identifies and aggregates information from relevant neighbors based on the specific relation. This involves component-level interaction (`phi` operator, which can be subtraction, multiplication, cross interaction, or circular-correlation) and a relation-aware attention mechanism to weigh neighbor contributions.\n    *   **Macro-disentanglement:** Ensured by introducing *mutual information (MI) regularization*. This regularization term is applied to enhance the independence between different learned components of an entity, preventing them from becoming entangled.\n    *   **Adaptive Scoring:** The final prediction for KGC adaptively combines the results from each disentangled component based on the given relation (scenario), allowing for context-specific predictions.\n    *   **Novelty:** DisenKGAT represents the first attempt to explicitly leverage disentangled representation learning in the context of knowledge graph completion, providing adaptive, robust, and interpretable entity embeddings \\cite{wu2021}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods:**\n        *   Proposed DisenKGAT, a novel Disentangled Knowledge Graph Attention Network, for learning disentangled embeddings in KGs, designed to be generalizable to various score functions \\cite{wu2021}.\n        *   Introduced a *relation-aware aggregation mechanism* for micro-disentanglement, which semantically aggregates neighborhood information while maintaining consistency with the adaptive scoring part of the model.\n        *   Developed a *mutual information-based regularization* technique for macro-disentanglement, effectively reducing intra-component correlation and promoting independence among components.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations:** The overall architecture integrates disentangled transformation, relation-aware aggregation, independence constraints, and adaptive scoring into a cohesive framework.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis:** Formalizes the application of micro- and macro-disentanglement concepts to knowledge graphs, addressing the multi-faceted nature of entities and the context-dependency of relations in KGC.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments conducted:** Extensive experiments were performed on public benchmark datasets to evaluate the model's effectiveness \\cite{wu2021}.\n    *   **Key performance metrics and comparison results:** DisenKGAT demonstrated superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both *accuracy* and *explainability*. The experiments also validated the model's strong *robustness*.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical limitations/assumptions:** The model assumes that entities can be effectively decomposed into a predefined number of `K` independent components. The effectiveness of the mutual information regularization relies on its ability to accurately enforce this independence. The choice of `K` is a hyperparameter that needs tuning.\n    *   **Scope of applicability:** The primary focus is on Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), specifically predicting missing entities in `(h, r, ?)` triplets. The proposed encoder model is designed with flexibility to be potentially generalized to work with various existing score functions.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of state-of-the-art:** DisenKGAT significantly advances the state-of-the-art in KGC by moving beyond static entity representations to adaptive, disentangled ones. This approach better captures the complex, multi-faceted nature of entities and the context-dependency of relations, leading to more accurate and nuanced predictions \\cite{wu2021}.\n    *   **Potential impact on future research:** This work opens new avenues for research into disentangled representation learning within complex, heterogeneous graph structures like KGs. It provides a strong foundation for developing more interpretable, robust, and context-aware KGC models, and could inspire similar dynamic embedding approaches for other graph-based tasks.",

However, with the explosion of network volume, the problem of data sparsity that causes large-scale KG systems to calculate and manage difficultly has become more significant. For alleviating the issue, knowledge graph embedding is proposed to embed entities and relations in a KG to a low-, dense and continuous feature space, and endow the yield model with abilities of knowledge inference and fusion. In recent years, many researchers have poured much attention in this approach, and we will systematically introduce the existing state-of-the-art approaches and a variety of applications that benefit from these methods in this paper. In addition, we discuss future prospects for the development of techniques and application trends. Specifically, we first introduce the embedding models that only leverage the information of observed triplets in the KG. We illustrate the overall framework and specific idea and compare the advantages and disadvantages of such approaches. Next, we introduce the advanced models that utilize additional semantic information to improve the performance of the original methods. We divide the additional information into two categories, including textual descriptions and relation paths. The extension approaches in each category are described, following the same classification criteria as those defined for the triplet fact-based models.

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \\cite{ge2022} for a literature review:\n\n### Technical Paper Analysis: CompoundE: Knowledge Graph Embedding with Translation, Rotation and Scaling Compound Operations \\cite{ge2022}\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the challenge of effectively modeling complex relation types (e.g., 1-N, N-1, N-N, symmetric, antisymmetric, transitive, non-commutative, sub-relations) in Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models, especially in low-dimensional settings and for large-scale KGs.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: Real-world KGs contain a vast number of entities and complex relations, making it difficult for existing KGE models to achieve high performance without high-dimensional embeddings or to handle diverse relation patterns. Many existing models (like TransE, RotatE) are limited to a single geometric operation, which restricts their expressive power and ability to distinguish complex relation compositions.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: CompoundE builds upon distance-based KGE models like TransE (translation) and RotatE (rotation) by integrating a broader set of geometric operations. It positions itself as a generalization of several distance-based models, including TransE, RotatE, PairRE, and LinearRE, by showing they can be derived as special cases of CompoundE.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   TransE struggles with 1-N, N-1, N-N, and symmetric relations.\n        *   Models based on single operations (translation, rotation, scaling) lack the expressive power to capture the full complexity of relations, particularly non-commutative compositions or hierarchical structures.\n        *   Many models may require high-dimensional embeddings, leading to memory constraints and computational costs, especially for large KGs.\n        *   Existing models often have specific strengths but also weaknesses, and a unified approach leveraging multiple strengths is lacking.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: CompoundE proposes a novel KGE model that leverages a cascade of three fundamental geometric manipulation operations: translation, rotation, and scaling. These operations are applied to entity embeddings to model relations.\n        *   It defines three forms of scoring functions: CompoundE-Head (applies compound operation to head entity), CompoundE-Tail (applies to tail entity), and CompoundE-Full (applies to both).\n        *   The constituent operators (translation, rotation, scaling) are relation-specific and can be cascaded in any order or subset, offering significant design flexibility.\n        *   The model uses a self-adversarial negative sampling loss function, similar to RotatE.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   **Compound Operations**: It is the first KGE model to systematically combine all three geometric operations (translation, rotation, scaling) into a \"compound operation,\" inspired by their successful use in image processing.\n        *   **Affine Group Framework**: CompoundE is formally cast within the framework of the affine group, demonstrating its mathematical properties and showing that it is a more general transformation than those restricted to the Special Euclidean Group (which includes only translation and rotation). This mathematical foundation explains its enhanced capability to model complex relations.\n        *   **Generalization**: It mathematically proves that several existing distance-based KGE models are special cases of CompoundE, providing a unifying perspective.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**: Introduction of CompoundE, a novel KGE model that integrates translation, rotation, and scaling operations in a cascaded, relation-specific manner.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: Mathematical proof that CompoundE belongs to the affine group, which is a more general group than the Special Euclidean Group, enabling it to model a richer set of complex relation types (e.g., symmetric/antisymmetric, inversion, transitive, commutative/non-commutative, sub-relations).\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: The flexible design allows for various permutations and subsets of the three operations, enabling adaptation to different dataset characteristics.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Extensive link prediction experiments were conducted on three popular KG completion datasets.\n    *   **Datasets**: ogbl-wikikg2 (large-scale, challenging for scalability), FB15k-237, and WN18RR (challenging for modeling symmetry/antisymmetry and composition relation patterns).\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics**: Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hits@k (Hits@1, Hits@3, Hits@10) using filtered ranking protocol.\n    *   **Comparison Results**:\n        *   CompoundE consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance across all three datasets, outperforming numerous benchmarking models including TransE, DistMult, ComplEx, RotatE, TuckER, AutoSF, PairRE, and GIE.\n        *   On the large-scale ogbl-wikikg2 dataset, CompoundE significantly outperformed previous KGE models with *fewer parameters* and *lower embedding dimensions*, implying reduced computation and memory costs while achieving higher accuracy.\n        *   The results confirm that cascading geometric transformations is an effective strategy, as CompoundE showed significant improvement over models using single operations.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The paper primarily focuses on distance-based scoring functions and does not explicitly discuss limitations of CompoundE itself, but rather highlights its advantages over previous models. The detailed proofs for modeling various relation types are stated to be in the appendix (Section 6.3), which is not provided in the excerpt.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The model is primarily validated for the link prediction (KG completion) task. Its applicability to other downstream tasks (e.g., multi-hop reasoning, entity classification) is implied but not directly demonstrated in the provided text.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: CompoundE significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in KGE by introducing a more powerful and generalized geometric transformation framework. It demonstrates that combining translation, rotation, and scaling operations is highly effective for modeling complex relations and achieving superior performance.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n        *   Offers a unifying perspective for many existing distance-based KGE models, potentially guiding the design of future models.\n        *   Its ability to handle complex relations and scale efficiently to large KGs with fewer parameters opens avenues for developing more robust and resource-efficient KGE solutions.\n        *   The affine group theoretical foundation provides a strong mathematical basis for further exploration of geometric transformations in KGE.",

Previous work such as TransE, TransH and TransR/CTransR regard a relation as translation from head entity to tail entity and the CTransR achieves state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we propose a more fine-grained model named TransD, which is an improvement of TransR/CTransR. In TransD, we use two vectors to represent a named symbol object (entity and relation). The first one represents the meaning of a(n) entity (relation), the other one is used to construct mapping matrix dynamically. Compared with TransR/CTransR, TransD not only considers the diversity of relations, but also entities. TransD has less parameters and has no matrix-vector multiplication operations, which makes it can be applied on large scale graphs. In Experiments, we evaluate our model on two typical tasks including triplets classification and link prediction. Evaluation results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

Therefore, this paper focuses on multi-domain item-item (I2I) recommendation based on cross-domain knowledge graph embedding by analyzing the association between items of the same domain and the interaction between items of diverse domains with the aid of knowledge graph that contains rich information. First, a cross-domain knowledge graph chiasmal embedding approach is proposed to efficiently interact all items in multiple domains. To help achieve both homo-domain embedding and hetero-domain embedding of items, a binding rule is put forward. Second, a multi-domain I2I recommendation method is presented to efficiently recommend items in multiple domains, which is a recommendation method based on link prediction of knowledge graph. Finally, the proposed methods are compared and analyzed with some benchmark methods using two datasets.

Among them, composition patterns are particularly important, as they involve nearly all relations in KGs. However, prior KGE approaches often consider relations to be compositional only if they are well-represented in the training data. Consequently, it can lead to performance degradation, especially for under-represented composition patterns. To this end, we propose HolmE, a general form of KGE with its relation embedding space closed under composition, namely that the composition of any two given relation embeddings remains within the embedding space. This property ensures that every relation embedding can compose, or be composed by other relation embeddings. It enhances HolmE\u2019s capability to model under-represented (also called long-tail) composition patterns with limited learning instances. To our best knowledge, our work is pioneering in discussing KGE with this property of being closed under composition. We provide detailed theoretical proof and extensive experiments to demonstrate the notable advantages of HolmE in modelling composition patterns, particularly for long-tail patterns. Our results also highlight HolmE\u2019s effectiveness in extrapolating to unseen relations through composition and its state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.",

It also acknowledges neural network-based KGEs (e.g., R-GCN, ConvE) and few-shot KGEs for long-tail entities/relations \\cite{zheng2024}.\n    *   **Limitations of previous solutions:** Previous KGEs often model relations as compositional only if well-represented in training data, which is a restrictive assumption that contradicts the nature of real-world relations \\cite{zheng2024}. This leads to poor performance on under-represented composition patterns and limits their ability to adapt to new compositional relationships \\cite{zheng2024}. The paper explicitly states it differs from typical few-shot learning KGEs by focusing on *composition patterns* with minimal representation, rather than long-tail entities or relations themselves \\cite{zheng2024}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core technical method or algorithm:** The paper proposes **HolmE**, a general form of Riemannian KGE. The core idea is to design a relation embedding space that is **closed under composition**, meaning the composition of any two given relation embeddings remains within the same embedding space \\cite{zheng2024}. HolmE leverages Riemannian geometry, specifically hyperbolic space, and extends M\u00f6bius addition to product spaces for computational efficiency \\cite{zheng2024}.\n    *   **What makes this approach novel or different:** HolmE is pioneering in discussing KGE with the property of being closed under composition \\cite{zheng2024}. This property ensures that every relation embedding can compose or be composed by other relation embeddings, aligning with the theoretical nature of real-world relations and enabling robust modeling of composition patterns regardless of their representation in training data \\cite{zheng2024}.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel algorithms, methods, or techniques:**\n        *   Introduction and formal definition of the property of KGE models being \"closed under composition\" \\cite{zheng2024}.\n        *   Proposal of **HolmE**, a novel Riemannian KGE model designed to satisfy this closure property \\cite{zheng2024}.\n        *   Extension of M\u00f6bius addition to product spaces of hyperbolic spaces for efficient computation \\cite{zheng2024}.\n    *   **Theoretical insights or analysis:**\n        *   Detailed theoretical proof and empirical evaluation demonstrating the property of being closed under composition for HolmE \\cite{zheng2024}.\n        *   Theoretical proof that prominent KGE models like TransE \\cite{bordes2013} and RotatE \\cite{sun2019} are special cases of HolmE, providing a unifying framework \\cite{zheng2024}.\n        *   In-depth analysis and quantification of composition patterns within KG data using \"triple count\" and \"representing ratio\" metrics \\cite{zheng2024}.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments conducted:** Extensive experiments were conducted on benchmark datasets (and extra datasets in the journal extension) to evaluate HolmE's performance \\cite{zheng2024}. These experiments specifically focused on demonstrating HolmE's advantages in modeling composition patterns, particularly in long-tail scenarios with restricted learning instances, and its ability to extrapolate to unseen relations \\cite{zheng2024}. Three research hypotheses regarding HolmE's superior properties in capturing composition patterns were verified \\cite{zheng2024}.\n    *   **Key performance metrics and comparison results:** The results highlight HolmE's notable advantages in modeling composition patterns, especially for long-tail patterns \\cite{zheng2024}. It demonstrated effectiveness in extrapolating to unseen relations through composition and achieved state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets \\cite{zheng2024}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical limitations or assumptions:** The paper primarily focuses on the mathematical properties inherent in traditional KGEs that explicitly capture relation patterns \\cite{zheng2024}. It explicitly omits discussion on neural network-based models \\cite{zheng2024}. The approach specifically targets composition patterns with minimal representation in training data, rather than general few-shot learning for entities or relations themselves \\cite{zheng2024}.\n    *   **Scope of applicability:** HolmE is applicable to scenarios where robust modeling of diverse relation patterns, especially composition, is critical, and where long-tail composition patterns are prevalent. Its theoretical elegance and ability to extrapolate make it suitable for evolving KGs and knowledge discovery tasks.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **How does this advance the technical state-of-the-art:** HolmE advances the state-of-the-art by introducing and formalizing the crucial property of \"closure under composition\" for KGE models, which was previously underexplored \\cite{zheng2024}. This property fundamentally enhances KGEs' capability to model complex, under-represented composition patterns and extrapolate to unseen relations, overcoming a significant limitation of prior work \\cite{zheng2024}. Its theoretical unification of existing models like TransE and RotatE also provides a deeper understanding of KGE architectures \\cite{zheng2024}.\n    *   **Potential impact on future research:** This work opens new avenues for KGE research by emphasizing the importance of algebraic properties in embedding spaces. It could inspire the development of other KGE models with strong theoretical guarantees for various relation patterns, leading to more robust, interpretable, and generalizable knowledge graph reasoning systems. The focus on long-tail composition patterns has implications for improving knowledge graph completion in real-world, incomplete KGs \\cite{zheng2024}.",

It consists of three main stages:\n        1.  **Constellation Partitioning (CPa):**\n            *   Utilizes Louvain clustering \\cite{blondel2008} (or Leiden algorithm for comparison) to partition the KG into topological clusters based on edge density, without relying on node/edge attributes.\n            *   Constructs a symmetric weighted adjacency matrix from KG triples.\n            *   Employs a hierarchical merging strategy with multiple thresholds (\u03b4, \u03a6=\u03b3\u00d7\u03b2\u00d7\u03b4, \u03c3) to merge small outlier clusters with larger, denser \"nearest linked neighbors\" (NLN) while capping cluster size to avoid entity explosion. This ensures a relatively similar number of entities per cluster and preserves overall graph modularity.\n        2.  **Weighted Aggregation Composition (WAC) Convolution:**\n            *   An improved compositional message-passing GCN algorithm.\n            *   Harnesses graph attention layers \\cite{liu2021} and two distinct composition functions (Eq. 2 & 3) for message aggregation, incorporating entity, relation, and learnable weight vectors.\n            *   Uses GELU activation function and an attention layer (\u0393) after normalizing messages with the degree matrix (G).\n            *   Updates relation embeddings with a separate learnable weight vector (Eq. 5).\n            *   Decodes embeddings using a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) with a multiplication operation similar to SimplE \\cite{kazemi2018}, followed by batch normalization.\n        3.  **Global Decoder (GD) Framework:**\n            *   A separate framework for global-level inference after cluster-specific embeddings are learned.\n            *   Concatenates upscaled feature vectors for all nodes and relations (e.g., `ec_u` from dimension `1xs` to `1xCs` with zero padding for other clusters).\n            *   These features are projected to lower dimensions using trainable weight matrices (We, Wr) and fed into a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).\n            *   Trained end-to-end using a multiclass Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss for link prediction.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:**\n        *   Introduces a dedicated, topology-preserving KG partitioning algorithm (CPa) that does not require node/edge features and minimizes cross-cluster links through hierarchical merging and NLN strategy.\n        *   Proposes an enhanced compositional GCN (WAC) that integrates attention mechanisms and a 1D-CNN for robust embedding learning.\n        *   Develops a novel Global Decoder framework to effectively combine embeddings from independently trained partitions for global inference, overcoming a major challenge in partitioned KGE.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions** \\cite{modak2024}\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods:**\n        *   **CPa (Constellation Partitioning):** A novel KG partitioning algorithm utilizing fast Louvain clustering and a hierarchical merging strategy to create topological clusters while minimizing lost links between them.\n        *   **WAC (Weighted Aggregation Composition) Convolution:** An improved compositional-GCN algorithm that couples a multiplication operation with a 1D convolutional network, leveraging feature, entity, and relation-specific weights for effective embedding learning.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations:**\n        *   A modular, three-stage architecture (CPa, WAC, GD) that enables scalable KGE by decoupling partitioning, local embedding learning, and global inference.\n        *   **Global Decoder Framework:** A unique framework designed to aggregate and utilize node and relationship embeddings from different clusters to achieve global-level inference, addressing the challenge of combining partitioned results.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis:**\n        *   Empirical verification that partitioning can speed up KGE without destroying the KG structure or jumbling inference logic, building on the idea that semantic features are locally contained \\cite{jain2021}.\n        *   Comparison and empirical verification of Louvain vs. Leiden algorithms for KG partitioning.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation** \\cite{modak2024}\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:**\n        *   Training and evaluation of CPa-WAC on standard KGE benchmarks.\n        *   Comparison of CPa-WAC against several state-of-the-art KGE methods.\n        *   Analysis of the impact of partitioning on training time and prediction accuracy.\n        *   Empirical comparison of Louvain and Leiden algorithms for partitioning.\n    *   **Datasets:** WN18, WN18RR (Wordnet), FB15K, FB15K-237 (Freebase).\n    *   **Hardware:** I7-13700, 32 GB RAM, NVIDIA RTX A2000 12 GB GPU.\n    *   **Optimizer:** AdamW.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics:** Prediction accuracy (implied by \"similar performance\" and \"outperforms\"), training time.\n    *   **Comparison Results:**\n        *   **Training Time:** CPa-WAC reduces training time by up to five times compared to training a GCN on the whole KG.\n        *   **Prediction Accuracy:** Achieves similar prediction performance to training a GCN on the entire KG, demonstrating that meaningful partitioning can retain accuracy.\n        *   **State-of-the-Art Comparison:** CPa-WAC outperforms several other state-of-the-art KGE methods in terms of prediction accuracy.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope** \\cite{modak2024}\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:**\n        *   The Louvain clustering algorithm, while effective, has limitations in directly partitioning heterogeneous directed graphs, necessitating the hierarchical merging strategy.\n        *   Assumes that semantic features are primarily contained locally within graph partitions, allowing for effective partitioning without significant loss of global semantic information \\cite{jain2021}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:**\n        *   Primarily focused on scalable KGE for link prediction, node classification, and reasoning tasks.\n        *   The CPa partitioning method is particularly suited for KGs without explicit node or edge attributes, as it relies on graph topology and edge density.\n\n7.

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific technical problem**: The paper addresses the long-standing issue of incompleteness in Knowledge Graphs (KGs) by focusing on Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), which involves predicting missing entities or relations in factual triplets \\cite{shen2022}.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: KGs are vital resources for various applications (e.g., question answering, web search), but their incompleteness hinders wider adoption. The challenge lies in effectively leveraging both structural patterns (e.g., composition of relations) and semantic relatedness (e.g., meanings of entities and relations) for KGC, as existing methods typically rely on one or the other \\cite{shen2022}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to existing approaches**: Previous KGC approaches fall into two main categories: structure-based methods (using graph embedding) and semantic-based methods (encoding text descriptions via language models) \\cite{shen2022}.\n    *   **Limitations of previous solutions**: Existing methods struggle to jointly process and integrate both structural and semantic information effectively, leading to suboptimal performance, especially in data-scarce scenarios \\cite{shen2022}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core technical method**: The paper proposes LASS (Joint Language Semantic and Structure Embedding), a method that jointly embeds the semantics from natural language descriptions of knowledge triplets with their structural information \\cite{shen2022}. LASS fine-tunes pre-trained language models (LMs) using a probabilistic structured loss.\n    *   **Novelty**: LASS's innovation lies in its unified approach: the forward pass of the LM captures semantics from textual descriptions, while a structured loss function, optimized via LM backpropagation, reconstructs KG structures. This allows for simultaneous learning of both types of information within a single framework \\cite{shen2022}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel algorithms, methods, or techniques**: LASS integrates structural and semantic information for KGC by fine-tuning pre-trained LMs with a structured loss. Semantic embedding is achieved by mean pooling over LM outputs for concatenated textual descriptions of head, relation, and tail entities. Structure embedding is performed by optimizing a probabilistic structured loss, inspired by TransE, which models relationships as translations between entity embeddings \\cite{shen2022}.\n    *   **System design or architectural innovations**: The method constructs input sequences as `[B]Th[S]Tr[S]Tt[S]` for LMs, where `Th, Tr, Tt` are token sequences for head, relation, and tail descriptions. A probabilistic model `Pr(h|r,t)` is defined based on a score function `f(h,r,t) = -1/2 ||h+r-t||^2_2`, and negative sampling is used for efficient optimization of the negative log-likelihood loss \\cite{shen2022}.\n    *   **Theoretical insights or analysis**: LASS demonstrates how deep language representations can be effectively connected with KG structures, providing a mechanism to transfer rich semantic knowledge from LMs to structural patterns in KGs \\cite{shen2022}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments conducted**: LASS was evaluated on two KGC tasks: link prediction and triplet classification, and its performance was also assessed in low-resource settings \\cite{shen2022}.\n    *   **Key performance metrics and comparison results**:\n        *   **Datasets**: FB15K-237, WN18RR, UMLS (link prediction); WN11, FB13 (triplet classification, low-resource) \\cite{shen2022}.\n        *   **LMs used**: BERT (BASE/LARGE) and RoBERTa (BASE/LARGE) \\cite{shen2022}.\n        *   **Triplet Classification**: LASS consistently achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy on WN11 and FB13, outperforming KG-BERT and various structure-based methods. LASS-BERT variants generally showed slightly better results than LASS-RoBERTa \\cite{shen2022}.\n        *   **Low-Resource Settings**: LASS-BERT LARGE significantly outperformed KG-BERT and other baselines when trained with limited data (e.g., 5-30% of training data), demonstrating superior data efficiency and improved knowledge transfer \\cite{shen2022}.\n        *   **Link Prediction**: LASS achieved SOTA Hits@10 and Mean Rank (MR) on WN18RR, and competitive performance on FB15k-237 and UMLS, surpassing many shallow and deep structure embedding methods, as well as other language semantic embedding approaches like KG-BERT and StAR \\cite{shen2022}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical limitations or assumptions**: The paper does not explicitly detail technical limitations of LASS itself. However, its reliance on natural language descriptions for entities and relations implies that its performance might be affected by the quality and availability of such textual data. The TransE-inspired score function, while effective, might inherit some of TransE's known limitations in handling complex relation patterns (e.g., 1-N, N-1, N-N relations) \\cite{shen2022}.\n    *   **Scope of applicability**: LASS is primarily applicable to knowledge graph completion tasks (link prediction, triplet classification) where natural language descriptions for entities and relations are available \\cite{shen2022}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advance the technical state-of-the-art**: LASS significantly advances the state-of-the-art in KGC by providing a robust and effective method for jointly leveraging both structural and semantic information, leading to SOTA performance across various benchmarks \\cite{shen2022}.\n    *   **Potential impact on future research**: The work highlights the critical importance of integrating both semantics and structures for understanding KGs. Its strong performance in low-resource settings suggests a path for building more data-efficient KGC models. It also sheds light on the connections between KGs and deep language representation, opening avenues for future research at this intersection \\cite{shen2022}.",

        "abstract": "Recently, many promising embedding models have been proposed to embed knowledge graphs (KGs) and their more general forms, such as n-ary relational data (NRD) and hyper-relational KG (HKG). To promote the data adaptability and performance of embedding models, KG searching methods propose to search for suitable models for a given KG data set. But they are restricted to a single KG form, and the searched models are restricted to a single type of embedding model. To tackle such issues, we propose to build a search space for the message function in graph neural networks (GNNs). However, it is a non-trivial task. Existing message function designs fix the structures and operators, which makes them difficult to handle different KG forms and data sets. Therefore, we first design a novel message function space, which enables both structures and operators to be searched for the given KG form (including KG, NRD, and HKG) and data. The proposed space can flexibly take different KG forms as inputs and is expressive to search for different types of embedding models. Especially, some existing message function designs and some classic KG embedding models can be instantiated as special cases of our space. We empirically show that the searched message functions are data-dependent, and can achieve leading performance on benchmark KGs, NRD, and HKGs.",

However, poisoning attacks in FKGE, which lead to biased decisions by downstream applications, remain unexplored. This paper is the first work to systematize the risks of FKGE poisoning attacks, from which we develop a novel framework for poisoning attacks that force the victim client to predict specific false facts. Unlike centralized KGEs, FKGE maintains KGs locally, making direct injection of poisoned data challenging. Instead, attackers must create poisoned data without access to the victim's KG and inject it indirectly through FKGE aggregation. Specifically, to create poisoned data, the attacker first infers the targeted relations in the victim's local KG via a new KG component inference attack. Then, to accurately mislead the victim's embeddings via aggregation, the attacker locally trains a shadow model using the poisoned data and uses an optimized dynamic poisoning scheme to adjust the model and generate progressive poisoned updates. Our experimental results demonstrate the attack's effectiveness, achieving a remarkable success rate on various KGE models (e.g., 100% on TransE with WN18RR) while keeping the original task's performance nearly unchanged.",

Indeed, existing KGs suffer from the data imbalance issue, i.e., entities and relations conform to a long-tail distribution, only a small portion of entities and relations occur frequently, while the vast majority of entities and relations only have a few training samples. Existing KGE methods assign equal weights to each entity and relation during the training process. Under this setting, long-tail entities and relations are not fully trained during training, leading to unreliable representations. In this paper, we propose WeightE, which attends differentially to different entities and relations. Specifically, WeightE is able to endow lower weights to frequent entities and relations, and higher weights to infrequent ones. In such manner, WeightE is capable of increasing the weights of long-tail entities and relations, and learning better representations for them. In particular, WeightE tailors bilevel optimization for the KGE task, where the inner level aims to learn reliable entity and relation embeddings, and the outer level attempts to assign appropriate weights for each entity and relation. Moreover, it is worth noting that our technique of applying weights to different entities and relations is general and flexible, which can be applied to a number of existing KGE models. Finally, we extensively validate the superiority of WeightE against various state-of-the-art baselines.",

Such limitation stems from weak interactions between entities and their relation contexts, leading to low expressiveness in modeling complex structures and resulting in inaccurate predictions.

In specific, ConQuatE incorporates contextual cues from various connected relations to enrich the original entity representations. Notably, this is achieved through efficient vector transformations in quaternion space, without any extra information required other than original triples.

Conventional knowledge graph embedding methods map elements in a knowledge graph, including entities and relations, into continuous vector spaces by assigning them one or multiple specific embeddings (i.e., vector representations). Thus the number of embedding parameters increases linearly as the growth of knowledge graphs. In our proposed model, Entity-Agnostic Representation Learning (EARL), we only learn the embeddings for a small set of entities and refer to them as reserved entities. To obtain the embeddings for the full set of entities, we encode their distinguishable information from their connected relations, k-nearest reserved entities, and multi-hop neighbors. We learn universal and entity-agnostic encoders for transforming distinguishable information into entity embeddings. This approach allows our proposed EARL to have a static, efficient, and lower parameter count than conventional knowledge graph embedding methods. Experimental results show that EARL uses fewer parameters and performs better on link prediction tasks than baselines, reflecting its parameter efficiency.",

Instead of learning specific embeddings for *all* entities, EARL only learns embeddings for a small, pre-selected set of \"reserved entities\" ($E_{res}$). For all other entities, it employs universal, entity-agnostic encoders to transform their \"distinguishable information\" into embeddings.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   **Entity-Agnostic Encoding**: The model's components (encoders) are independent of the number of entities, ensuring a static and efficient parameter count that does not scale linearly with KG size.\n        *   **Three Types of Distinguishable Information**:\n            1.  **ConRel (Connected Relation Information)**: Captures an entity's semantics by its connected relations and their directions. A novel \"relational feature\" is introduced, representing the frequency of an entity being a head or tail for each relation. This feature is then encoded using a 2-layer MLP.\n            2.  **kNResEnt (k-Nearest Reserved Entity Information)**: Addresses the potential ambiguity of ConRel by incorporating information from similar reserved entities. It calculates cosine similarity between an entity's relational feature and those of reserved entities, then uses a weighted sum of the top-k nearest reserved entity embeddings.\n            3.  **MulHop (Multi-hop Neighbor Information)**: Integrates broader structural context by feeding the combined `ConRel` and `kNResEnt` encodings into a Graph Neural Network (GNN). The GNN aggregates multi-hop neighbor information to refine entity representations.\n        *   **Modular Design**: Combines these three information types sequentially: relational features -> ConRel encoding -> kNResEnt encoding -> GNN for MulHop encoding.\n        *   **Training**: Utilizes RotatE \\cite{chen2023} as the score function and a self-adversarial negative sampling loss for optimization.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions** \\cite{chen2023}\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**:\n        *   Introduction of the concept of \"entity-agnostic representation learning\" as a paradigm shift for KGEs to tackle parameter efficiency.\n        *   Development of EARL, a novel KGE method that encodes entity embeddings from their distinguishable information rather than direct lookup.\n        *   Design of \"relational features\" to effectively capture connected relation information for entities.\n        *   Integration of k-nearest reserved entities and multi-hop neighbor information for robust entity distinguishability.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: A unique architecture that combines a small set of trainable reserved entity embeddings with universal encoders for all other entities, enabling parameter efficiency.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: Demonstrates that rich entity representations can be learned compositionally from local context and structural information, rather than requiring unique, large-scale embedding vectors for every entity.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Extensive empirical evaluations were performed on various KG benchmarks with diverse characteristics. The primary task was link prediction.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   EARL \\cite{chen2023} consistently uses *fewer parameters* compared to conventional KGE baselines.\n        *   Despite using fewer parameters, EARL achieves *better or competitive performance* on link prediction tasks, demonstrating its parameter efficiency.\n        *   The results empirically validate the effectiveness of the entity-agnostic encoding approach.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The selection of reserved entities is random, and the impact of different selection strategies or the hyper-parameter `k` for nearest reserved entities is not fully explored in the provided text. The paper's primary focus is parameter efficiency, not necessarily outperforming all state-of-the-art KGE models in raw performance.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: Primarily applicable to knowledge graph embedding tasks, particularly link prediction. Its main benefit lies in enabling KGE deployment in resource-constrained environments (e.g., edge devices) and distributed learning settings (e.g., federated learning) where parameter count is a critical factor.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance** \\cite{chen2023}\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art**: EARL \\cite{chen2023} introduces a novel and highly effective approach to address the long-standing problem of parameter explosion in KGEs, shifting the paradigm from entity-specific embeddings to entity-agnostic encoding. It demonstrates that significant parameter reduction can be achieved without sacrificing performance.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n        *   Opens new avenues for research into compositional and generative entity representation learning in KGs.\n        *   Facilitates the practical deployment of KGE models in real-world, resource-limited scenarios.\n        *   Could inspire further exploration of different types of \"distinguishable information\" and more advanced entity-agnostic encoding architectures.\n        *   Contributes to the development of more scalable, sustainable, and efficient knowledge graph technologies.",

While most KG embedding algorithms hold the assumption that all triples are correct, considerable errors were inevitably injected during the construction process. It is urgent to develop effective error-aware KG embedding, since errors in KGs would lead to significant performance degradation in downstream applications. To this end, we propose a novel framework named Attributed Error-aware Knowledge Embedding (AEKE). It leverages the semantics contained in entity attributes to guide the KG embedding model learning against the impact of erroneous triples. We design two triple-level hypergraphs to model the topological structures of the KG and its attributes, respectively. The confidence score of each triple is jointly calculated based on self-contradictory within the triple, consistency between local and global structures, and homogeneity between structures and attributes. We leverage confidence scores to adaptively update the weighted aggregation in the multi-view graph learning framework and margin loss in KG embedding, such that potential errors will contribute little to KG learning. Experiments on three real-world KGs demonstrate that AEKE outperforms state-of-the-art KG embedding and error detection algorithms.",

Recently, transition-based KGE methods have achieved promising performance, where the single relation vector learns to translate head entity to tail entity. However, this scoring pattern is not suitable for complex scenarios where the same entity pair has different relations. Previous models usually focus on the improvement of entity representation for 1-to-N, N-to-1 and N-to-N relations, but ignore the single relation vector. In this paper, we propose a novel transition-based method, TranS, for knowledge graph embedding.

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \"TranS: Transition-based Knowledge Graph Embedding with Synthetic Relation Representation\" \\cite{zhang2022} for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Problem**: Traditional transition-based Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) methods, like TransE, use a single relation vector to translate a head entity to a tail entity. This scoring pattern is inadequate for complex scenarios, especially when the *same entity pair* can have *multiple different relations* (e.g., \"professor\" and \"employer\" between a person and a university, or multiple roles for a person in a film) \\cite{zhang2022}.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge**: Knowledge graphs often contain such complex relationships (one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many). Previous models (e.g., TransH/R/D) focused on improving entity representations for these complex relations but still relied on a single, static relation vector, which limits their ability to capture the nuances of multiple relationships between the same entities \\cite{zhang2022}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: The work is positioned within the family of transition-based KGE methods, which are popular due to their simplicity and effectiveness \\cite{zhang2022}. It builds upon the foundational idea of TransE (h + r \u2248 t).\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   TransE struggles with complex relations like one-to-many/many-to-one/many-to-many \\cite{zhang2022}.\n        *   Subsequent models (e.g., TransH, TransR, TransD) improved entity representations (e.g., using hyperplanes or multiple embedding spaces) to handle complex relation types, but critically, they *still used a single relation vector* (`r`) in their scoring patterns. This single vector cannot differentiate between multiple relationships for the same entity pair \\cite{zhang2022}.\n        *   Compared to InterHT, TranS uses a sum of multiple relation vectors for its relation part, rather than a single vector. Compared to TripleRE, TranS applies synthetic relation vectors *only* to the relation part of the scoring function, unlike TripleRE which applies three relations to three different parts (head, tail, relation) \\cite{zhang2022}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The proposed model, TranS, replaces the traditional single relation vector (`r`) with a \"synthetic relation representation\" \\cite{zhang2022}.\n    *   **Scoring Function**: The core scoring pattern is `||R_h - R_t + R_r||`, where `R_h` is the head representation, `R_t` is the tail representation, and `R_r` is the novel synthetic relation representation \\cite{zhang2022}.\n    *   **Synthetic Relation Representation**: `R_r` is defined as the sum of three distinct relation vectors: `~r \u2218 h + r + ^r \u2218 t`.\n        *   `r`: a main relation vector (similar to traditional models).\n        *   `~r \u2218 h`: an auxiliary relation vector dynamically combined with the head entity (`h`) using a Hadamard product (`\u2218`).\n        *   `^r \u2218 t`: an auxiliary relation vector dynamically combined with the tail entity (`t`) using a Hadamard product (`\u2218`).\n    *   **Context-Aware Entity Representations**: `R_h` and `R_t` are also made context-aware using Hadamard products: `R_h = h \u2218 ~t` and `R_t = t \u2218 ~h`, where `~h` and `~t` are auxiliary entity vectors \\cite{zhang2022}.\n    *   **OOV Handling**: Incorporates NodePiece \\cite{zhang2022} to learn a fixed-size entity vocabulary, addressing out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issues for large KGs.\n    *   **Loss Function**: Utilizes self-adversarial negative sampling loss during training \\cite{zhang2022}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Synthetic Relation Representation**: The primary innovation is the introduction of a dynamic, synthetic relation vector (`~r \u2218 h + r + ^r \u2218 t`) that adapts based on the specific head and tail entities, effectively addressing the limitation of single relation vectors for complex scenarios \\cite{zhang2022}.\n    *   **Contextualized Entity and Relation Embeddings**: The use of Hadamard products to create `R_h = h \u2218 ~t`, `R_t = t \u2218 ~h`, and the components of `R_r` allows for richer, context-dependent representations of entities and relations within a triplet \\cite{zhang2022}.\n    *   **Improved Handling of Complex Relations**: Provides a more robust mechanism for modeling multiple distinct relationships between the same entity pair, a significant challenge for previous transition-based models \\cite{zhang2022}.\n    *   **Parameter Efficiency**: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with a significantly reduced number of parameters compared to leading baselines \\cite{zhang2022}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Dataset**: Evaluated on the large-scale ogbl-wikikg2 dataset \\cite{zhang2022}, which contains 2.5 million entities, 535 relation types, and over 17 million edges. The dataset uses a time-based split to simulate realistic KG completion.\n    *   **Metrics**: Performance is measured using Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) with the standard filtered metric \\cite{zhang2022}.\n    *   **Key Results**:\n        *   TranS + NodePiece achieved state-of-the-art results with 0.6988 MRR on the validation set and 0.6882 MRR on the test set \\cite{zhang2022}.\n        *   It outperformed the previous best model, TripleREv3 + NodePiece (0.6955 val MRR, 0.6866 test MRR), while using approximately half the parameters (19.2M vs. 36.4M) \\cite{zhang2022}.\n        *   A larger TranS model (38.4M parameters) further improved performance to 0.7101 val MRR and 0.6992 test MRR \\cite{zhang2022}.\n    *   **Implementation**: Adam optimizer, learning rate 0.0005, batch size 512, dropout 0.1, negative sampling size 128, embedding dimension 200, 20k NodePiece anchors \\cite{zhang2022}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Focus on Transition-based Models**: The primary scope of the paper is to improve transition-based KGE models, and its direct comparison to other KGE paradigms (e.g., semantic matching, neural networks) is not extensively explored \\cite{zhang2022}.\n    *   **Dependency on NodePiece**: The reported state-of-the-art results are achieved in conjunction with NodePiece for entity representation, suggesting that the core TranS model benefits from this external component for large-scale KGs with OOV entities \\cite{zhang2022}.\n    *   **Lack of Ablation Study**: The paper does not include an ablation study to individually quantify the contribution of each component of the synthetic relation representation (`~r \u2218 h`, `r`, `^r \u2218 t`) or the Hadamard product for entity representations \\cite{zhang2022}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement in KGEs**: TranS significantly advances the state-of-the-art in transition-based KGEs by providing an effective solution to the long-standing problem of modeling complex relations, particularly when multiple relations exist between the same entity pair \\cite{zhang2022}.\n    *   **High Performance with Efficiency**: Achieves superior performance on a challenging large-scale benchmark while maintaining or improving parameter efficiency, which is crucial for practical applications \\cite{zhang2022}.\n    *   **Future Research Direction**: The concept of synthetic, context-aware relation representation opens new avenues for research into more dynamic and adaptive modeling of relationships in knowledge graphs and other graph-structured data \\cite{zhang2022}.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) are of great importance to many artificial intelligence applications, but they usually suffer from the incomplete problem. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE), which aims to represent entities and relations in low-dimensional continuous vector spaces, has been proved to be a promising approach for KG completion. Traditional KGE methods only concentrate on structured triples, while paying less attention to the type information of entities. In fact, incorporating entity types into embedding learning could further improve the performance of KG completion. To this end, we propose a universal Type-augmented Knowledge graph Embedding framework (TaKE) which could utilize type features to enhance any traditional KGE models. TaKE automatically captures type features under no explicit type information supervision. And by learning different type representations of each entity, TaKE could distinguish the diversity of types specific to distinct relations. We also design a new type-constrained negative sampling strategy to construct more effective negative samples for the training process. Extensive experiments on four datasets from three real-world KGs (Freebase, WordNet and YAGO) demonstrate the merits of our proposed framework. In particular, combining TaKE with the recent tensor factorization KGE model SimplE can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the KG completion task.",

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific technical problem**: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) suffer from incompleteness, limiting their utility in AI applications like question answering and recommendation systems \\cite{he2023}. Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) is a promising approach for KG completion, but traditional methods often neglect valuable entity type information.\n    *   **Importance and challenge**: Entity types provide crucial semantic context (e.g., \"painter\" for \"Da Vinci\" when linked by \"paint\") that can significantly improve KGE performance \\cite{he2023}. However, existing type-sensitive KGE models face challenges: they are often inflexible, tightly coupled to specific KGE architectures, require explicit type information (which is frequently incomplete or unavailable in real-world KGs like Freebase or WordNet), and fail to account for the diversity of entity types (an entity can have multiple types, and different relations highlight distinct type features) \\cite{he2023}.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to existing approaches**: The work builds upon traditional KGE models (e.g., TransE, DistMult, ComplEx, SimplE) that learn embeddings from structured triples \\cite{he2023}. It also relates to prior type-sensitive KGE models (e.g., TKRL, TransC, JOIE, TransT, TaRP, CAKE, TypeDM, TypeComplex) that attempt to incorporate type information \\cite{he2023}.\n    *   **Limitations of previous solutions**:\n        *   Traditional KGEs ignore entity type information, limiting their expressive power \\cite{he2023}.\n        *   Previous type-sensitive KGEs often require explicit type supervision, which is a significant limitation for many real-world KGs \\cite{he2023}.\n        *   Many existing type-sensitive models tightly encode type information into their objective functions, making them less flexible for integration with diverse KGE models \\cite{he2023}.\n        *   They often neglect the diversity of entity types, where an entity's relevant type can vary based on the specific relation it participates in \\cite{he2023}.\n        *   Existing negative sampling strategies (uniform, Bernoulli, or simple type-constrained) can introduce false negatives, hinder entity clustering, or also require explicit type information \\cite{he2023}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core technical method**: The paper proposes a universal **Type-augmented Knowledge graph Embedding framework (TaKE)**, designed to enhance any traditional KGE model by incorporating implicit type features \\cite{he2023}.\n    *   **Novelty**:\n        *   **Model-agnostic framework**: TaKE is designed to be combined with *any* traditional KGE model, making it highly flexible and universally applicable \\cite{he2023}.\n        *   **Automatic implicit type feature capture**: It learns type features automatically without requiring explicit type information supervision, addressing a major limitation of prior work \\cite{he2023}.\n        *   **Diversity of entity types**: TaKE models the diversity of entity types by employing a **relation-specific hyperplane mechanism**. This projects an entity's type representation onto different hyperplanes corresponding to its distinct connected relations, highlighting specific type features for each context \\cite{he2023}.\n        *   **Two-view representation**: The framework conceptually divides a type-aware KG into an \"entity-view\" (relation-entity triples) and a \"type-view\" (relation-type triples), mapping them into distinct vector spaces to capture specific and general features, respectively \\cite{he2023}.\n        *   **Type compatibility function**: A novel function is designed to model the type constraint between entities and their connected relations, facilitating the learning of implicit type features \\cite{he2023}.\n        *   **New type-constrained negative sampling strategy**: This strategy constructs more effective negative samples by dynamically sampling from both homogeneous and non-homogeneous candidate sets, leveraging type-constrained prior knowledge without explicit type information \\cite{he2023}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   A novel, model-agnostic **TaKE framework** that can augment any traditional KGE model to be type-sensitive, without requiring explicit type information \\cite{he2023}.\n    *   An innovative **relation-specific hyperplane mechanism** to capture and distinguish the diversity of entity types based on their associated relations \\cite{he2023}.\n    *   A **type compatibility function** for automatically learning implicit type features and modeling type constraints \\cite{he2023}.\n    *   A new **type-constrained negative sampling strategy** that generates high-quality negative samples efficiently, even without explicit type supervision \\cite{he2023}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments conducted**: Extensive experiments were performed on the knowledge graph completion (link prediction) task \\cite{he2023}.\n    *   **Datasets**: Four widely used benchmarks derived from three real-world KGs: Freebase, WordNet, and YAGO \\cite{he2023}.\n    *   **Key performance metrics and comparison results**:\n        *   TaKE-augmented KGE models consistently outperformed their corresponding base models across all experiments \\cite{he2023}.\n        *   Specifically, combining TaKE with SimplE (TaKE-SimplE) achieved state-of-the-art performance on the KG completion task compared to all baselines \\cite{he2023}.\n        *   Visualization of vectorial representations demonstrated that type embeddings learned by TaKE cluster more effectively than entity embeddings, confirming its ability to capture meaningful type features \\cite{he2023}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical limitations/assumptions**: The paper primarily focuses on addressing the limitations of *previous* KGE methods. While TaKE is presented as a universal framework, its performance is demonstrated within the scope of KG completion. The implicit assumption is that type information, even when not explicitly labeled, can be effectively inferred and leveraged from the existing graph structure.\n    *   **Scope of applicability**: TaKE is broadly applicable to various KGs, including those lacking explicit type information. It can be integrated with any traditional KGE model, enhancing its capabilities for downstream tasks like link prediction \\cite{he2023}.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances state-of-the-art**: TaKE significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in KG completion by providing a flexible and effective method to incorporate type information, achieving top performance when combined with strong base models like SimplE \\cite{he2023}.\n    *   **Potential impact on future research**: The model-agnostic nature of TaKE and its ability to learn implicit type features without explicit supervision offer a powerful paradigm for future KGE research. It opens avenues for enhancing a wide range of existing and novel KGE models, making them more robust and semantically aware, especially in scenarios where explicit type data is scarce \\cite{he2023}. The novel negative sampling strategy also provides a valuable contribution to improving training efficiency and quality in KGE.",

Although the previous graph neural networks (GNN) based models have achieved promising results, they cannot directly capture the interactions of multi-facts at different timestamps. To address the above limitation, we propose a time-aware relational graph attention model (TARGAT), which takes the multi-facts at different timestamps as a unified graph. First, we develop a relational generator to dynamically generate a series of time-aware relational message transformation matrices, which jointly models the relations and the timestamp information into a unified way. Then, we apply the generated message transformation matrices to project the neighborhood features into different time-aware spaces and aggregate these neighborhood features to explicitly capture the interactions of multi-facts. Finally, a temporal transformer classifier is applied to learn the representation of the query quadruples and predict the missing entities. The experimental results show that our TARGAT model beats the GNN-based models by a large margin and achieves new state-of-the-art results on four popular benchmark datasets.",

In this paper, we study the challenging problem of inference over temporal knowledge graphs. In particular, the task of temporal link prediction. In general, this is a difficult task due to data non-stationarity, data heterogeneity, and its complex temporal dependencies. \nWe propose Chronological Rotation embedding (ChronoR), a novel model for learning representations for entities, relations, and time. Learning dense representations is frequently used as an efficient and versatile method to perform reasoning on knowledge graphs. The proposed model learns a k-dimensional rotation transformation parametrized by relation and time, such that after each fact's head entity is transformed using the rotation, it falls near its corresponding tail entity. By using high dimensional rotation as its transformation operator, ChronoR captures rich interaction between the temporal and multi-relational characteristics of a Temporal Knowledge Graph.

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper `\\cite{sadeghian2021}` for a literature review:\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: The paper addresses the challenging problem of temporal link prediction in Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs), which involves inferring missing facts (quadruples `(h, r, t, \u03c4)`) that include a temporal dimension.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: This problem is crucial because real-world facts and relations evolve over time, making static Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning insufficient. It is challenging due to:\n        *   Data non-stationarity and heterogeneity.\n        *   Complex temporal dependencies between facts.\n        *   The inherent incompleteness of KGs.\n        *   Limitations of existing TKG models, which often suffer from a large number of parameters, making them difficult to train, or rely on inadequate, time-sparse datasets.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**:\n        *   Builds upon the success of static KG embedding models, particularly rotation-based models like RotatE `\\cite{sun2019rotate}`.\n        *   Extends KG embedding techniques to incorporate time, learning representations for entities, relations, and timestamps.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**:\n        *   Most prior research focused on static KGs, failing to capture temporal dynamics.\n        *   Early temporal approaches either ignored timestamps, aggregated static embeddings, or used sequence models (e.g., RNNs) that sometimes only learned dynamic embeddings for relations, not entities.\n        *   Many existing temporal link prediction models utilize a large number of parameters, hindering training efficiency.\n        *   Some models were evaluated on datasets sparse in the time domain, limiting their generalizability.\n        *   Static rotation models like RotatE use Euclidean distance for scoring, which can be problematic in high-dimensional spaces due to the \"curse of dimensionality.\"\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes **ChronoR (Chronological Rotation embedding)**, a novel model for learning representations in TKGs based on k-dimensional rotation transformations.\n    *   **Rotation-based Transformation**: ChronoR learns a `k`-dimensional rotation transformation `Qr,\u03c4` (parametrized by both relation `r` and time `\u03c4`) such that when applied to a head entity `h`, it maps `h` close to its corresponding tail entity `t` (i.e., `Qr,\u03c4(h) \u2248 t`). This high-dimensional rotation captures rich interactions between temporal and multi-relational characteristics.\n    *   **Novel Scoring Function**: Unlike RotatE, which uses Euclidean distance, ChronoR defines its scoring function `g(h,r,t,\u03c4) := <Qr,\u03c4(h), t>` based on the **inner product** (cosine similarity) between the transformed head entity and the tail entity. This is motivated by observations that Euclidean norms can be less effective in high dimensions.\n    *   **Theoretical Generalization**: The paper demonstrates a significant theoretical insight: the proposed inner product scoring function is a generalization of commonly used scoring functions in complex-domain models like ComplEx `\\cite{trouillon2016complex}` (specifically, `Re(h * r - t)`) when `k=2` (complex numbers).\n    *   **Parameterization of `Q`**: The linear operator `Q` is parameterized by concatenating relation and time embeddings (`[r|\u03c4]`). An additional static rotation component `r2` is included to better represent facts that are static or less time-dependent.\n    *   **Optimization and Regularization**:\n        *   Minimizes the negative log-likelihood of correct predictions, avoiding the need for negative sampling.\n        *   Introduces a novel **tensor nuclear norm-inspired regularization** (`\u03a84(\u0398)`) that treats the TKG directly as an order 4 tensor.\n        *   Incorporates a **temporal smoothness objective** (`\u03a9\u03c4`) using the 4-norm to encourage similar transformations for chronologically closer timestamps, reflecting the smooth evolution of entities over time.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Model**: ChronoR, a state-of-the-art rotation-based embedding model specifically designed for temporal knowledge graphs.\n    *   **Unified Rotation and Temporal Modeling**: Effectively integrates k-dimensional rotation transformations with temporal information, allowing for complex interactions between relations and time.\n    *   **Inner Product Scoring Function**: Proposes and validates an inner product-based scoring function that is more robust in high dimensions and generalizes existing complex-domain scoring methods.\n    *   **Theoretical Link**: Provides a theoretical foundation by proving that common complex-domain scoring functions are a special case of ChronoR's approach.\n    *   **Advanced Regularization**: Introduces a novel tensor nuclear norm-inspired regularization for TKGs and a 4-norm based temporal smoothness regularization, enhancing model generalizability.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: ChronoR was evaluated on the temporal link prediction task.\n    *   **Datasets**: Performance was assessed on three widely used benchmark datasets: ICEWS14, ICEWS05-15, and YAGO15K.\n    *   **Performance Metrics**: Standard metrics for link prediction were used: Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Hit@1, Hit@3, and Hit@10.\n    *   **Comparison Results**: ChronoR consistently outperformed numerous state-of-the-art baselines, including TransE, DistMult, ComplEx, SimpIE, ConT, TTransE, HyTE, TA-DistMult, DE-SimpIE, TIMEPLEX, TNTComplEx, TeRo, and TeMP-SA. For example, ChronoR (k=2) achieved an MRR of 62.53 on ICEWS14, surpassing TNTComplEx (60.72) and TeMP-SA (60.7). On ICEWS05-15, ChronoR (k=3) achieved an MRR of 68.41, outperforming TNTComplEx (66.64) and TeMP-SA (68.0).\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The current work focuses on predicting temporal facts *within the observed time range* (`T`) rather than forecasting future events.\n    *   **Assumptions**: Assumes time is often discretized in TKGs.\n    *   **Computational Feasibility**: While the negative log-likelihood loss is preferred for its theoretical benefits, its computational feasibility (avoiding negative sampling) is noted to be suitable for the experimental scale, but could be a consideration for extremely large KGs.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advances State-of-the-Art**: ChronoR significantly pushes the technical state-of-the-art in temporal knowledge graph link prediction, demonstrating superior performance across multiple benchmarks.\n    *   **Novel Modeling Paradigm**: Introduces a robust and theoretically grounded rotation-based embedding approach that effectively captures the complex interplay of entities, relations, and time in dynamic KGs.\n    *   **Unified Perspective**: Provides a unifying theoretical framework by demonstrating the generalization capability of its inner-product scoring function over existing complex-domain methods.\n    *   **Impact on Future Research**: The success of ChronoR's rotation-based approach, novel scoring function, and regularization techniques opens new avenues for exploring more sophisticated temporal transformations, extending to forecasting tasks, and applying similar principles to other dynamic graph problems.",

Triplet-based approaches learn the embedding of missing entities by a single triple only. They ignore the fact that the knowledge graph is essentially a graph structure. Graph-based methods consider graph structure information but ignore the contextual information of nodes in the knowledge graph, making them unable to discern valuable entity (relation) information. In response to the above limitations, we propose a general graph transformer framework for knowledge graph embedding (TGformer). It is the first to use a graph transformer to build knowledge embeddings with triplet-level and graph-level structural features in the static and temporal knowledge graph. Specifically, a context-level subgraph is constructed for each predicted triplet, which models the relation between triplets with the same entity. Afterward, we design a knowledge graph transformer network (KGTN) to fully explore multi-structural features in knowledge graphs, including triplet-level and graph-level, boosting the model to understand entities (relations) in different contexts. Finally, semantic matching is adopted to select the entity with the highest score. Experimental results on several public knowledge graph datasets show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance in link prediction.",

However, existing methods for knowledge graph embedding fail to consider the influence of the embedding space, which makes them still unsatisfactory in practical applications. In this study, we try to improve the expressiveness of the embedding space from the perspective of the metric. Specifically, we first point out the implications of Minkowski metric used in KG embedding and then make a quantitative analysis. To solve the limitations, we introduce a new metric, named Cycle metric, based on the oscillation property of the periodic function. Furthermore, we find that the function period has a significant influence on the expressiveness of the embedding space. Given a fully trained model, the smaller the period, the better the expressive ability. Finally, to validate the findings, we propose a new model, named CyclE by combining Cycle Metric and the popular KG embeddings models. Comprehensive experimental results show that Cycle is more appropriate than Minkowski for KG embedding.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge graphs, which consist of entities and their relations, have become a popular way to store structured knowledge. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE), which derives a representation for each entity and relation, has been widely used to capture the semantics of the information in the knowledge graphs, and has demonstrated great success in many downstream applications, such as the extraction of similar entities in response to a query entity. However, existing KGE methods cannot work well on emerging knowledge graphs that are large-scale due to the constraints in storage and inference efficiency. In this paper, we propose a lightweight KGE model, LightKG, which significantly reduces storage as well as running time needed for inference. Instead of storing a continuous vector for every entity, LightKG only needs to store a few codebooks, each of which contains some codewords that correspond to the representatives among the embeddings, and the indices that correspond to the codeword selections for entities. Hence LightKG can achieve highly efficient storage. The efficiency of the downstream querying process can be significantly boosted too with the proposed LightKG model as the relevance score between the query and an entity can be efficiently calculated via a quick look-up in a table that contains the scores between the query and codewords. The storage and inference efficiency of LightKG is achieved by its novel design. LightKG is an end-to-end framework that automatically infers codebooks and codewords and generates an approximated embedding for each entity. A residual module is included in LightKG to induce the diversity among codebooks, and a continuous function is adopted to approximate codeword selection, which is non-differential. In addition, to further improve the performance of KGE, we propose a novel dynamic negative sampling method based on quantization, which can be applied to the proposed LightKG or other KGE methods. We conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets. The experiments show that LightKG is search and memory efficient with high approximate search accuracy. Also, the dynamic negative sampling can dramatically improve model performance with over 19% improvement on average.",

Existing FKGE methods typically harness the arithmetic mean of entity embeddings from all clients as the global supplementary knowledge, and learn a replica of global consensus entities embeddings for each client. However, these methods usually neglect the inherent semantic disparities among distinct clients. This oversight not only results in the globally shared complementary knowledge being inundated with too much noise when tailored to a specific client, but also instigates a discrepancy between local and global optimization objectives. Consequently, the quality of the learned embeddings is compromised. To address this, we propose Personalized Federated knowledge graph Embedding with client-wise relation Graph (PFedEG), a novel approach that employs a client-wise relation graph to learn personalized embeddings by discerning the semantic relevance of embeddings from other clients. Specifically, PFedEG learns personalized supplementary knowledge for each client by amalgamating entity embedding from its neighboring clients based on their\"affinity\"on the client-wise relation graph. Each client then conducts personalized embedding learning based on its local triples and personalized supplementary knowledge. We conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets to evaluate our method against state-of-the-art models and results demonstrate the superiority of our method.",

This approach neglects the inherent semantic disparities among distinct clients, leading to:\n        *   Globally shared complementary knowledge being \"inundated with too much noise\" when tailored to a specific client \\cite{zhang2024}.\n        *   A discrepancy between local and global optimization objectives, compromising the quality of learned embeddings \\cite{zhang2024}.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: With the rise of data privacy regulations like GDPR, KGs are increasingly distributed across multiple clients (Federated Knowledge Graphs, FKG). FKGE aims to collaboratively learn embeddings from these distributed KGs while preserving privacy. The core challenge is that KGs from different clients often have varying relation sets and thus diverse semantics for shared entities (semantic disparity), making a \"one-size-fits-all\" global aggregation ineffective \\cite{zhang2024}.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**:\n        *   Current FKGE methods primarily fall into client-server (e.g., FedE, FedEC, FedR) or peer-to-peer (e.g., FKGE) architectures \\cite{zhang2024}.\n        *   FedE \\cite{zhang2024} is a pioneering model using simple averaging for aggregation.

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the paper \"OntoEA: Ontology-guided Entity Alignment via Joint Knowledge Graph Embedding\" by Xiang et al. \\cite{xiang2021} for a literature review:\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem**: Existing embedding-based entity alignment (EA) methods for knowledge graphs (KGs) often produce incorrect mappings due to ignoring the ontological schema (classes, class hierarchies, and logical constraints like class disjointness). These errors, termed \"class conflicts,\" are a significant source of false positives in EA.\n    *   **Importance and Challenge**: KGs are crucial but often incomplete and heterogeneous, necessitating EA for comprehensive usability. Current methods, while utilizing graph structure, entity names, and attributes, overlook the critical meta-information within ontologies. For instance, \\cite{xiang2021} found that 42.2% and 55.7% of wrongly predicted mappings in the EN-FR-15K-V1 benchmark by BootEA and RSN4EA, respectively, were class-conflicted. The challenges in leveraging ontologies include: (1) the difficulty of jointly embedding KGs and their associated ontologies into a unified space, and (2) the fact that class conflicts (e.g., disjointness) are often not explicitly defined in ontologies and can vary contextually.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Existing Approaches**: Prior embedding-based EA methods primarily focus on embedding KGs by utilizing their graph structure, entity names, and attributes. Examples include MTransE, JAPE, SEA, BootEA, GCNAlign, AliNet, and RSN4EA.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: These methods universally *ignore* the ontological schema, which contains vital meta-information such as classes, their hierarchical relationships, and logical constraints (e.g., class disjointness). This oversight leads to the aforementioned \"class conflict\" errors, where entities belonging to semantically incompatible classes are incorrectly aligned.\n    *   **Positioning**: OntoEA \\cite{xiang2021} is presented as the first method to effectively utilize both ontology information and embedding techniques for KG alignment, directly addressing the limitations of prior work by integrating ontological semantics into the alignment process.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: OntoEA proposes an ontology-guided entity alignment method that jointly embeds KGs and their associated ontologies. It leverages class hierarchy and class disjointness to enrich semantic embeddings and prevent false mappings.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**:\n        *   **Joint Embedding Framework**: Integrates five modules: entity embedding, ontology embedding, confliction loss, membership loss, and alignment loss, enabling simultaneous learning of KG and ontology representations.\n        *   **Class Conflict Matrix (CCM)**: A novel mechanism to represent inter-class conflicts. It captures explicitly defined disjointness, implicitly indicated conflicts via class hierarchy distance, and conflicts deduced from common entity members or seed mappings.\n        *   **Non-linear Ontology Embedding**: Employs a non-linear transformation (tanh) for embedding class hierarchical structures, which is more suitable for transitive relations like `subClassOf` than traditional translation-based models (e.g., TransE).\n        *   **Membership Embedding**: Uses a non-linear transformation to map entity embeddings to the ontology embedding space, explicitly linking entities to their classes.\n        *   **Iterative Co-Training Strategy**: Optimizes the combined loss function in an iterative manner, enhancing model convergence and reducing complexity.\n        *   **Weighted Similarity for Prediction**: Combines cosine similarities of both entity embeddings and their corresponding class embeddings for robust alignment prediction.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**:\n        *   The **Class Conflict Matrix (CCM)** and its associated **Confliction Loss** (minimizing negative log-likelihood based on CCM and cosine similarity of class embeddings) for explicitly modeling and learning inter-class conflicts, including implicit ones.\n        *   A **non-linear transformation-based ontology embedding module** designed to handle the transitive nature of `subClassOf` relations effectively.\n        *   A **membership embedding module** that uses non-linear transformations to bridge the entity and class embedding spaces, enriching KG embeddings with ontological semantics.\n        *   An **iterative co-training strategy** for optimizing the multi-component loss function.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: The modular framework that seamlessly integrates diverse knowledge sources (KG triples, ontology hierarchy, class disjointness, entity-class memberships, and seed alignments) into a unified embedding space.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: The recognition that class conflicts are a significant and quantifiable source of error in EA, and that these conflicts can be systematically modeled and learned, even when not explicitly defined, through a combination of explicit constraints and structural heuristics (e.g., class hierarchy distance).\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Extensive experiments were performed on seven benchmarks: six popular public EA benchmarks (EN-FR-15K-V1/V2, EN-DE-15K-V1/V2, D-W-15K-V1/V2) and a new, challenging industrial benchmark (MED-BBK-9K). The authors also extended these benchmarks by extracting and appending ontologies and membership relationships. For benchmarks with non-shared ontologies, ontology alignment was performed using either manual annotation or the PARIS system.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**: OntoEA was compared against state-of-the-art EA models, including translation-based (MTransE, JAPE, SEA, BootEA), graph neural network-based (GCNAlign, AliNet), and recurrent neural network-based (RSN4EA) approaches, as well as models utilizing entity surface information.\n        *   OntoEA consistently **outperformed all state-of-the-art baselines** across all seven benchmarks.\n        *   Notably, it achieved **over 35% higher Hits@1, Hits@5, and MRR** compared to the best baseline on the challenging MED-BBK-9K industrial benchmark.\n        *   Ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of each individual module (ontology embedding, confliction loss, membership loss) in contributing to the overall performance.\n        *   The experiments validated the effectiveness of ontology guidance in both scenarios: when KGs share a common ontology and when they have separate ontologies (after pre-alignment).\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**:\n        *   Requires a small set of known entity mappings (seed mappings) for the alignment loss.\n        *   For KGs with separate ontologies, a pre-alignment step for the ontologies themselves is necessary, which can involve manual annotation or existing ontology alignment systems.\n        *   The entity embedding module currently uses TransE for simplicity and efficiency, though the framework is designed to be compatible with more advanced KG embedding methods.\n        *   For entities associated with multiple classes, the approach averages their class embeddings, which might be a simplification in complex scenarios.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: OntoEA is applicable to knowledge graphs that are accompanied by an ontological schema and membership relationships between entities and classes. It is versatile enough to handle scenarios where KGs share a single ontology or have distinct ontologies (provided they can be pre-aligned).\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: OntoEA significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in entity alignment by introducing the first comprehensive framework that effectively integrates ontological knowledge into embedding-based EA. It directly addresses a critical, previously overlooked source of error (class conflicts), leading to substantial performance improvements.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**:\n        *   Establishes a new paradigm for KG alignment, highlighting the crucial role of ontological context and opening new research directions for leveraging richer semantic information.\n        *   Provides a robust and extensible framework that can be adapted with more advanced KG embedding techniques or sophisticated ontology alignment methods.\n        *   Its success, particularly on an industrial benchmark, underscores its practical utility for real-world applications, especially in domain-specific areas (e.g., medical AI) where semantic consistency and accuracy are paramount.\n        *   The release of extended benchmarks with ontological information serves as a valuable resource for future research and comparative studies in ontology-guided EA.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge Graph (KG) embeddings are a powerful tool for predicting missing links in KGs. Existing techniques typically represent a KG as a set of triplets, where each triplet (h, r, t) links two entities h and t through a relation r, and learn entity/relation embeddings from such triplets while preserving such a structure. However, this triplet representation oversimplifies the complex nature of the data stored in the KG, in particular for hyper-relational facts, where each fact contains not only a base triplet (h, r, t), but also the associated key-value pairs (k, v). Even though a few recent techniques tried to learn from such data by transforming a hyper-relational fact into an n-ary representation (i.e., a set of key-value pairs only without triplets), they result in suboptimal models as they are unaware of the triplet structure, which serves as the fundamental data structure in modern KGs and preserves the essential information for link prediction. To address this issue, we propose HINGE, a hyper-relational KG embedding model, which directly learns from hyper-relational facts in a KG. HINGE captures not only the primary structural information of the KG encoded in the triplets, but also the correlation between each triplet and its associated key-value pairs. Our extensive evaluation shows the superiority of HINGE on various link prediction tasks over KGs. In particular, HINGE consistently outperforms not only the KG embedding methods learning from triplets only (by 0.81-41.45% depending on the link prediction tasks and settings), but also the methods learning from hyper-relational facts using the n-ary representation (by 13.2-84.1%).",

Currently, most KG embedding models are trained based on negative sampling, i.e., the model aims to maximize some similarity of the connected entities in the KG, while minimizing the similarity of the sampled disconnected entities. Negative sampling helps to reduce the time complexity of model learning by only considering a subset of negative instances, which may fail to deliver stable model performance due to the uncertainty in the sampling procedure. To avoid such deficiency, we propose a new framework for KG embedding\u2014Efficient Non-Sampling Knowledge Graph Embedding (NS-KGE). The basic idea is to consider all of the negative instances in the KG for model learning, and thus to avoid negative sampling. The framework can be applied to square-loss based knowledge graph embedding models or models whose loss can be converted to a square loss. A natural side-effect of this non-sampling strategy is the increased computational complexity of model learning. To solve the problem, we leverage mathematical derivations to reduce the complexity of non-sampling loss function, which eventually provides us both better efficiency and better accuracy in KG embedding compared with existing models. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our NS-KGE framework can achieve a better performance on efficiency and accuracy over traditional negative sampling based models, and that the framework is applicable to a large class of knowledge graph embedding models.",

Some models require a large number of negative samples, increasing training time.\n        *   **Improved Negative Sampling**: Still fundamentally rely on sampled instances, thus not fully addressing the limitations of partial information and potential fluctuations \\cite{li2021}.\n        *   **Non-Sampling in Other Domains**: These methods are typically not generalizable to KGE models (especially square-loss based ones) and often focus only on time complexity, neglecting space efficiency, which necessitates batch learning \\cite{li2021}.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes the **Efficient Non-Sampling Knowledge Graph Embedding (NS-KGE)** framework.\n        *   It aims to train KGE models by considering *all* positive and negative instances, thereby eliminating the need for negative sampling.\n        *   The framework is applicable to KGE models whose loss function is a square loss or can be converted into one.\n        *   To overcome the dramatic increase in computational and space complexity from non-sampling, the core innovation is a **mathematical re-derivation and re-organization of the non-sampling square loss function**.\n        *   The loss function is initially formulated as a sum over all possible triplets (Eq. 1) and then re-organized into terms for positive instances (`L_P`), all entities (`L_A`), and a constant (Eq. 3).\n        *   For factorization-based KGE models, the scoring function `f_r(h,t)` (e.g., `e_h^T (r \u2299 e_t)`) is manipulated to express its square `f_r(h,t)^2` in a way that **disentangles the head entity, relation, and tail entity embeddings**. This disentanglement allows for a more efficient calculation of the `L_A` term, which is the most computationally expensive part.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference**: The primary novelty is the development of a **general and efficient non-sampling framework for KGE** that simultaneously addresses both the time and space complexity bottlenecks. This is achieved through a sophisticated mathematical re-organization of the square loss function, enabling full-data training without sacrificing computational tractability, a significant departure from prevalent negative sampling methods.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**:\n        *   Introduction of the **Non-Sampling Knowledge Graph Embedding (NS-KGE) framework**.\n        *   A novel mathematical derivation that transforms the computationally intensive non-sampling square loss into an efficient form by disentangling entity and relation parameters, thereby mitigating time and space bottlenecks.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations**: Provides a general framework applicable to a broad class of square-loss based KGE models.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis**: Demonstrates that the full non-sampling loss, traditionally considered intractable, can be made computationally efficient through algebraic manipulation, offering a new paradigm for KGE training.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: The NS-KGE framework was applied to four representative KGE models: DistMult \\cite{li2021}, SimplE \\cite{li2021}, ComplEx \\cite{li2021}, and TransE \\cite{li2021}. Experiments were conducted on \"benchmark datasets\" (specific names not provided in the excerpt).\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics and Comparison Results**:\n        *   **Accuracy**: The NS-KGE framework is reported to achieve \"better prediction accuracy\" compared to traditional negative sampling based models.\n        *   **Efficiency**: NS-KGE demonstrates \"better efficiency\" (shorter running time) and \"better space efficiency\" than existing negative sampling models.\n        *   Overall, the framework \"outperforms most of the models in terms of both prediction accuracy and learning efficiency\" \\cite{li2021}.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The NS-KGE framework is specifically designed for and applicable to **square-loss based KGE models** or models whose loss functions can be mathematically converted into a square loss format \\cite{li2021}.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: The framework is generalizable to a \"large class of knowledge graph embedding models\" that meet the square-loss criterion, particularly factorization-based models where the scoring function can be expressed in a separable form (e.g., `e_h^T (r \u2299 e_t)`).\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advance State-of-the-Art**: NS-KGE significantly advances the state-of-the-art in KGE by providing a robust and efficient method to overcome the long-standing issues of instability and suboptimal accuracy associated with negative sampling. It enables KGE models to learn from all available data, leading to more reliable and accurate embeddings.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research**: This work opens new research directions for developing KGE models that do not rely on sampling, potentially leading to more stable and higher-quality embeddings. The mathematical approach to optimize computational and space complexity for full-data training could also inspire similar non-sampling methodologies in other machine learning domains where sampling is currently a necessary compromise.",

It is a special network in which nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships. KGs can intuitively model the connections between facts, but in many applications, there are certain limitations in directly using symbolic logic to represent knowledge in KGs and perform calculations, making it difficult to achieve expected results in downstream tasks. Meanwhile, with the explosive growth of Internet capacity, the traditional KG structure faces the problems of computational inefficiency and management difficulties. To alleviate these problems, Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is proposed to improve the computational efficiency by embedding entities and relations in the KG into a low-dimensional, dense and continuous vector space, and thus the solution of some problems in the knowledge graph is transformed into vector operations. Moreover, KGE also can be used as a pre-trained model which is more beneficial to downstream applications, such as applications based on deep learning. In this paper, we classify KGE into three categories, namely translational distance models, semantic matching models and neural network based models. The advantages and disadvantages of different embedding methods are compared, while the main applications of KGE are summarized. Some current challenges of KGE are summarized, as well as some views on the future research directions of KGE.",

Their effectiveness are deeply affected by the ability of modeling and inferring different relation patterns such as symmetry, asymmetry, inversion, composition and transitivity. Although existing models are already able to model many of these relations patterns, transitivity, a very common relation pattern, is still not been fully supported. In this paper, we first theoretically show that the transitive relations can be modeled with projections. We then propose the Rot-Pro model which combines the projection and relational rotation together. We prove that Rot-Pro can infer all the above relation patterns.

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n*   **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific technical problem:** Existing Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models struggle to effectively model and infer the *transitivity* relation pattern, despite its commonality and importance for link prediction \\cite{song2021}. While models like RotatE can handle symmetry, asymmetry, inversion, and composition, none fully support transitivity without forcing entity embeddings in a transitive chain to be identical, which limits expressiveness.\n    *   **Importance and challenge:** Transitivity (if (a,r,b) and (b,r,c), then (a,r,c)) is a fundamental logical pattern crucial for robust reasoning and inferring missing links in knowledge graphs. The challenge lies in designing a KGE model that can represent this property without collapsing distinct entity embeddings, while also maintaining the ability to model other complex relation patterns.\n\n*   **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to existing approaches:** The work builds upon and extends previous KGE models, particularly RotatE \\cite{song2021}. It categorizes existing models into \"Trans-series\" (e.g., TransE, TransH, TransR, BoxE) and \"Bilinear models\" (e.g., DistMult, ComplEx, RotatE, QuatE).\n    *   **Limitations of previous solutions:**\n        *   TransE and its variants, while good for composition and inversion, often require the translation vector for transitive relations to be zero, forcing entities in a transitive chain to have identical embeddings \\cite{song2021}.\n        *   RotatE, a state-of-the-art model, can infer symmetry, asymmetry, inversion, and composition, but similarly fails to model transitivity without forcing entity embeddings in a transitive chain to be the same (requiring rotation phases of `2n*pi`) \\cite{song2021}.\n        *   BoxE, a recent Trans-series model, can express composition and inversion but explicitly \"cannot express transitivity\" \\cite{song2021}.\n        *   The paper highlights that \"none of existing models is capable of modeling transitivity relation pattern\" alongside other patterns \\cite{song2021}.\n\n*   **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core technical method:** The proposed Rot-Pro model combines *projection* and *relational rotation* in a complex vector space \\cite{song2021}. For a triple `(h,r,t)`, it requires `rot(pr(eh(k)); r(k)) = pr(et(k))`, where `pr` is a projection and `rot` is a rotation.\n    *   **Novelty/Difference:**\n        *   **Projection for Transitivity:** The key innovation is the theoretical demonstration that transitive relations can be modeled using *idempotent transformations (projections)* \\cite{song2021}. A relation `r` is represented by a projection `pr(k)` defined by an idempotent matrix `Mr(k) = Sr(k)^-1 * diag(ar(k), br(k)) * Sr(k)`, where `ar(k), br(k) \u2208 {0,1}`. `Sr(k)` is simplified to a rotation matrix. This allows entities in a transitive chain to have distinct embeddings but share the same *projected vector*, overcoming the limitations of previous models that forced identical embeddings \\cite{song2021}.\n        *   **Unified Framework:** Rot-Pro integrates this projection mechanism for transitivity with the relational rotation mechanism (inspired by RotatE) to model symmetry, asymmetry, inversion, and composition, creating a single model capable of inferring all five patterns \\cite{song2021}.\n        *   **Projection Penalty Loss:** A novel `Lp` loss function is introduced during optimization to enforce the `0` or `1` constraint on the `a` and `b` parameters of the projection matrix, using a weighted penalty to encourage binary values \\cite{song2021}.\n\n*   **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Theoretical Insight:** Provides the first theoretical proof that transitive relations can be effectively modeled using idempotent transformations (projections) within a KGE framework \\cite{song2021}.\n    *   **Novel Algorithm:** Introduces Rot-Pro, a new KGE model that uniquely combines projection-based transitivity modeling with relational rotation, enabling comprehensive support for all five major relation patterns \\cite{song2021}.\n    *   **Comprehensive Pattern Support:** Theoretically proves that Rot-Pro can infer symmetry, asymmetry, inversion, composition, and transitivity patterns, a capability unmatched by prior KGE models \\cite{song2021}.\n    *   **Optimization Technique:** Develops a specialized projection penalty loss to ensure the learned projection matrices maintain their idempotent properties, crucial for the model's theoretical foundation \\cite{song2021}.\n\n*   **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments conducted:** Link prediction experiments were performed on four benchmark datasets: FB15k-237, WN18RR, YAGO3-10, and Countries \\cite{song2021}. The latter two datasets (YAGO3-10 and Countries) were specifically chosen for their \"abundant relation patterns including transitivity\" \\cite{song2021}.\n    *   **Key performance metrics and comparison results:**\n        *   Evaluated using Mean Rank (MR), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and Hit@k (Hit@1, Hit@3, Hit@10) in a filtered setting \\cite{song2021}.\n        *   Rot-Pro achieved state-of-the-art results on datasets containing transitive relations (YAGO3-10 and Countries) \\cite{song2021}.\n        *   On the Countries dataset, Rot-Pro significantly outperformed RotatE and other baselines, achieving near-perfect AUC-PR scores (1.00, 1.00, 0.998) across three composition tasks, demonstrating its effective inference of transitivity, symmetry, and composition \\cite{song2021}.\n        *   It also outperformed baseline models on most metrics for FB15k-237 and WN18RR, even though these datasets have fewer explicit transitive relations \\cite{song2021}.\n        *   The results empirically validate that Rot-Pro effectively learns the transitivity pattern \\cite{song2021}.\n\n*   **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical limitations/assumptions:** The primary advantage of Rot-Pro is most pronounced in datasets rich in transitive relations. Its improvement over RotatE on general datasets like FB15k-237 and WN18RR is noted as \"limited\" due to the insufficient presence of transitive relations in those benchmarks \\cite{song2021}.\n    *   **Scope of applicability:** The model is specifically designed for KGE tasks, particularly link prediction, with a strong focus on accurately modeling complex relation patterns, especially transitivity.\n\n*   **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of state-of-the-art:** Rot-Pro significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in KGE by providing a unified and theoretically grounded framework that can model *all five* fundamental relation patterns (symmetry, asymmetry, inversion, composition, and transitivity) \\cite{song2021}. This addresses a critical gap in existing KGE models.\n    *   **Potential impact on future research:** The introduction of projection-based modeling for transitivity opens new avenues for designing more expressive and logically consistent KGE models. It provides a strong foundation for future research into comprehensive relation pattern modeling and more sophisticated reasoning capabilities within knowledge graphs \\cite{song2021}.",

Most of the recent solutions for entity alignment are based on knowledge graph embedding, which maps knowledge entities in a low-dimension space where entities are connected with the guidance of prior aligned entity pairs. The study in this paper focuses on two important issues that limit the accuracy of current entity alignment solutions: 1) labeled data of priorly aligned entity pairs are difficult and expensive to acquire, whereas abundant of unlabeled data are not used; and 2) knowledge graph embedding is affected by entity's degree difference, which brings challenges to align high frequent and low frequent entities. We propose a semi-supervised entity alignment method (SEA) to leverage both labeled entities and the abundant unlabeled entity information for the alignment. Furthermore, we improve the knowledge graph embedding with awareness of the degree difference by performing the adversarial training. To evaluate our proposed model, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets. The experimental results show that our model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with significant improvement on alignment accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge Graph (KG) embedding has emerged as an active area of research resulting in the development of several KG embedding methods. Relational facts in KG often show temporal dynamics, e.g., the fact (Cristiano_Ronaldo, playsFor, Manchester_United) is valid only from 2003 to 2009. Most of the existing KG embedding methods ignore this temporal dimension while learning embeddings of the KG elements. In this paper, we propose HyTE, a temporally aware KG embedding method which explicitly incorporates time in the entity-relation space by associating each timestamp with a corresponding hyperplane. HyTE not only performs KG inference using temporal guidance, but also predicts temporal scopes for relational facts with missing time annotations. Through extensive experimentation on temporal datasets extracted from real-world KGs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model over both traditional as well as temporal KG embedding methods.",

For example, a fact like (Cristiano_Ronaldo, playsFor, Manchester_United) is only valid for a specific time period (e.g., 2003-2009).\n    *   **Importance & Challenge**: Ignoring the temporal dimension leads to incomplete or inaccurate KG inference, as the validity of facts is time-dependent. The challenge lies in effectively integrating time into the embedding space without overly complicating the model or losing expressive power.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches**: This work positions itself against the majority of existing KG embedding methods that do not account for the temporal dimension.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions**: Previous solutions are limited by their inability to capture the time-varying nature of facts, leading to static representations that cannot perform temporally-guided inference or predict temporal validity.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method**: The paper proposes HyTE, a temporally aware KG embedding method. Its core innovation is to explicitly incorporate time into the entity-relation embedding space.\n    *   **Novelty**: HyTE achieves this by associating each timestamp with a corresponding hyperplane. This allows the model to represent the temporal validity of facts geometrically within the embedding space.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods**: Introduction of HyTE, a novel hyperplane-based approach for integrating temporal information into KG embeddings.\n    *   **Functional Capabilities**:\n        *   Performs KG inference that is guided by temporal information.\n        *   Predicts temporal scopes for relational facts that have missing time annotations, a crucial capability for incomplete KGs.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted**: Extensive experimentation was carried out on temporal datasets. These datasets were extracted from real-world KGs.\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Results**: The experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of HyTE. It showed superior performance compared to both traditional KG embedding methods (which ignore time) and other existing temporal KG embedding methods.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions**: The provided abstract does not explicitly detail specific technical limitations or assumptions beyond the model's design choice of using hyperplanes.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability**: HyTE is specifically designed for Knowledge Graphs where relational facts exhibit temporal dynamics and where temporal information is either available or needs to be inferred.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art**: HyTE significantly advances the technical state-of-the-art in KG embeddings by providing a principled and effective way to explicitly model and leverage temporal information.\n    *   **Potential Impact**: It opens new avenues for more accurate and context-aware KG inference, especially in dynamic environments. The ability to predict temporal scopes for missing annotations is particularly impactful for knowledge graph completion and maintenance, enabling more robust and complete temporal KGs.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) consisting of a large number of triples have become widespread recently, and many knowledge graph embedding (KGE) methods are proposed to embed entities and relations of a KG into continuous vector spaces. Such embedding methods simplify the operations of conducting various in-KG tasks (e.g., link prediction) and out-of-KG tasks (e.g., question answering). They can be viewed as general solutions for representing KGs. However, existing KGE methods are not applicable to inductive settings, where a model trained on source KGs will be tested on target KGs with entities unseen during model training. Existing works focusing on KGs in inductive settings can only solve the inductive relation prediction task. They can not handle other out-of-KG tasks as general as KGE methods since they don't produce embeddings for entities. In this paper, to achieve inductive knowledge graph embedding, we propose a model MorsE, which does not learn embeddings for entities but learns transferable meta-knowledge that can be used to produce entity embeddings. Such meta-knowledge is modeled by entity-independent modules and learned by meta-learning. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms corresponding baselines for in-KG and out-of-KG tasks in inductive settings.",

        "summary": "Here's a focused summary of the technical paper for a literature review:\n\n### Technical Paper Analysis: Meta-Knowledge Transfer for Inductive Knowledge Graph Embedding \\cite{chen2021}\n\n1.  **Research Problem & Motivation**\n    *   **Specific Technical Problem:** Existing Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) methods are primarily designed for transductive settings, meaning they can only produce embeddings for entities seen during training. They fail in inductive settings where models need to generalize to entirely new Knowledge Graphs (KGs) containing entities unseen during training. While some inductive methods exist, they typically focus only on inductive relation prediction and do not produce general entity embeddings, thus limiting their applicability to a wide range of in-KG and out-of-KG tasks.\n    *   **Importance & Challenge:** KGs are constantly evolving, with new entities appearing daily. The inability of conventional KGEs to handle unseen entities restricts their utility in dynamic environments. Developing a general inductive KGE solution that can produce high-quality embeddings for novel entities is crucial for enabling various downstream applications (e.g., link prediction, question answering) on new or evolving KGs without extensive retraining. The challenge lies in learning transferable knowledge that is independent of specific entities.\n\n2.  **Related Work & Positioning**\n    *   **Relation to Existing Approaches:**\n        *   **Conventional KGEs (e.g., TransE, ComplEx, RotatE, R-GCN, CompGCN):** `\\cite{chen2021}` acknowledges their effectiveness in transductive settings but highlights their fundamental limitation in inductive scenarios due to learning fixed entity embeddings.\n        *   **Inductive KG methods (e.g., GraIL, CoMPILE, TACT, INDIGO):** These works address inductive settings by learning relation prediction from subgraph structures.\n        *   **Meta-learning in KGs (e.g., GMatching, MetaR, GEN, L2P-GNN, MI-GNN):** Previous meta-learning applications in KGs often focus on few-shot scenarios or out-of-knowledge-base (OOKB) entities connected to a known KG.\n    *   **Limitations of Previous Solutions:**\n        *   Conventional KGEs are inherently transductive and cannot generalize to unseen entities.\n        *   Existing inductive KG methods (like GraIL) are limited to inductive *relation prediction* and do not produce *entity embeddings*, making them unsuitable for general in-KG and out-of-KG tasks that require entity representations.\n        *   Other inductive methods relying on textual descriptions are not general enough for scenarios where such information is unavailable.\n        *   Meta-learning approaches for KGs have not fully addressed the problem of generating embeddings for *entirely new entities in new KGs* in a general inductive setting.\n\n3.  **Technical Approach & Innovation**\n    *   **Core Technical Method (MorsE):** `\\cite{chen2021}` proposes MorsE, a model that learns \"meta-knowledge\" \u2013 transferable structural patterns \u2013 instead of specific entity embeddings. This meta-knowledge is then used to produce embeddings for unseen entities.\n        *   **Meta-knowledge Modeling:** MorsE instantiates meta-knowledge as two entity-independent modules:\n            *   **Entity Initializer:** Initializes entity embeddings using learnable relation-domain and relation-range embeddings. This captures type-level information based on the relations an entity is connected to.\n            *   **GNN Modulator:** Enhances these initialized embeddings by aggregating information from the entity's multi-hop neighborhood structure using a Graph Neural Network (GNN). This captures instance-level information.\n        *   **Meta-knowledge Learning:** MorsE employs a meta-learning framework. During meta-training on a source KG, tasks are sampled, each comprising a support set and a query set. Entities within these tasks are treated as \"unseen\" to simulate the inductive setting. The model learns to produce effective entity embeddings (via the initializer and modulator) based on the support triples, which are then evaluated on the query triples. This \"learning to produce embeddings\" capability allows MorsE to generalize to target KGs with entirely new entities.\n    *   **Novelty & Differentiation:**\n        *   Unlike prior inductive methods, MorsE provides a *general solution* for inductive KGE by producing *actual entity embeddings* for unseen entities, enabling a broader range of tasks.\n        *   It explicitly models and learns \"meta-knowledge\" through entity-independent modules (Initializer and GNN Modulator) that capture transferable structural patterns.\n        *   The meta-learning strategy is specifically designed to simulate the inductive setting by treating entities within training tasks as unseen, fostering generalization to entirely new KGs.\n\n4.  **Key Technical Contributions**\n    *   **Novel Algorithms/Methods:** Introduction of MorsE, a novel framework for inductive KGE that leverages meta-knowledge transfer.\n    *   **System Design/Architectural Innovations:**\n        *   The design of entity-independent modules: an **Entity Initializer** (using relation-domain and relation-range embeddings) and a **GNN Modulator** for refining embeddings based on neighborhood structure.\n        *   Integration of these modules within a meta-learning paradigm to enable \"learning to produce embeddings\" for unseen entities.\n    *   **Theoretical Insights/Analysis:** Emphasizes the concept of \"meta-knowledge\" as universal, entity-independent, and transferable structural patterns, drawing an analogy to human cognition. This provides a conceptual foundation for designing inductive KGE models.\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation**\n    *   **Experiments Conducted:** `\\cite{chen2021}` conducted extensive experiments to evaluate MorsE's performance in inductive settings for both in-KG and out-of-KG tasks.\n        *   **In-KG Task:** Link Prediction (predicting missing head or tail entities in triples).\n        *   **Out-of-KG Task:** Question Answering (likely involving entity retrieval or relation prediction based on questions).\n    *   **Key Performance Metrics & Comparison Results:** The paper states that MorsE \"significantly outperforms corresponding baselines\" for both in-KG and out-of-KG tasks in inductive settings. This indicates superior performance in generating reasonable and effective embeddings for unseen entities compared to existing methods.\n\n6.  **Limitations & Scope**\n    *   **Technical Limitations/Assumptions:** The paper does not explicitly list technical limitations in the provided abstract/introduction. However, it implicitly assumes that structural information (neighboring relations and multi-hop structures) is sufficient for cognizing new entities, without relying on additional features like textual descriptions. While framed as a strength for generality, this could be a limitation in extremely sparse KGs where structural patterns are minimal.\n    *   **Scope of Applicability:** MorsE is designed for inductive settings where a model trained on source KGs needs to generalize to *target KGs with entities entirely unseen* during training. It aims to provide general entity embeddings for these unseen entities, making it applicable to a wide array of in-KG (e.g., link prediction) and out-of-KG (e.g., question answering) tasks.\n\n7.  **Technical Significance**\n    *   **Advancement of State-of-the-Art:** `\\cite{chen2021}` significantly advances the state-of-the-art by providing the first general inductive KGE framework that produces *entity embeddings* for unseen entities. This addresses a critical gap left by previous inductive methods that focused solely on relation prediction.\n    *   **Potential Impact on Future Research:**\n        *   Opens new avenues for research in dynamic and evolving KGs, enabling KGE models to adapt to new entities and domains without complete retraining.\n        *   Encourages further exploration of meta-learning techniques for transferring structural knowledge in graph-structured data.\n        *   Could inspire the development of more sophisticated meta-knowledge modeling techniques that integrate other forms of information (e.g., textual, temporal) in an entity-independent manner.",
