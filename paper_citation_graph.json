      "abstract": "\n \n We deal with embedding a large scale knowledge graph composed of entities and relations into a continuous vector space. TransE is a promising method proposed recently, which is very efficient while achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance. We discuss some mapping properties of relations which should be considered in embedding, such as reflexive, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many. We note that TransE does not do well in dealing with these properties. Some complex models are capable of preserving these mapping properties but sacrifice efficiency in the process. To make a good trade-off between model capacity and efficiency, in this paper we propose TransH which models a relation as a hyperplane together with a translation operation on it. In this way, we can well preserve the above mapping properties of relations with almost the same model complexity of TransE. Additionally, as a practical knowledge graph is often far from completed, how to construct negative examples to reduce false negative labels in training is very important. Utilizing the one-to-many/many-to-one mapping property of a relation, we propose a simple trick to reduce the possibility of false negative labeling. We conduct extensive experiments on link prediction, triplet classification and fact extraction on benchmark datasets like WordNet and Freebase. Experiments show TransH delivers significant improvements over TransE on predictive accuracy with comparable capability to scale up.\n \n",

      "summary": "The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of **TransH**, a novel knowledge graph embedding model designed to effectively handle complex relation mapping properties (such as reflexive, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many) while maintaining the computational efficiency characteristic of simpler models like TransE.\n\n**Problem Addressed:**\nThe paper addresses the challenge of embedding large-scale knowledge graphs into continuous vector spaces. While TransE, a recently proposed method, offers efficiency and good predictive performance, it struggles to adequately model complex mapping properties inherent in real-world relations. More sophisticated models can preserve these properties but often sacrifice efficiency. The paper aims to find a good trade-off between model capacity (ability to capture complex relation types) and computational efficiency. Additionally, it tackles the practical problem of constructing negative examples during training to reduce false negative labels in incomplete knowledge graphs.\n\n**Method Used:**\nTransH models a relation not just as a translation vector, but as a **hyperplane** in the embedding space, along with a **translation operation performed on that hyperplane**. For a given triplet (head entity, relation, tail entity), both the head and tail entities are first projected onto the relation-specific hyperplane. The translation operation then occurs between these projected entities. This mechanism allows TransH to differentiate between entities involved in complex mappings (e.g., multiple tails for one head) without significantly increasing model complexity. Furthermore, the paper proposes a simple trick for constructing negative examples by leveraging the one-to-many/many-to-one mapping properties of relations, which helps reduce the likelihood of false negative labeling during training.\n\n**Key Findings:**\nExtensive experiments on benchmark datasets like WordNet and Freebase, across tasks such as link prediction, triplet classification, and fact extraction, demonstrate that TransH delivers significant improvements in predictive accuracy compared to TransE. Crucially, it achieves this enhanced performance with comparable scalability and efficiency, effectively balancing model capacity with computational cost. The model successfully preserves complex relation mapping properties, overcoming a key limitation of TransE.\n\n**Key Math Equations (Conceptual):**\nWhile explicit equations are not provided in the abstract, the core mathematical concept of TransH can be described as follows:\n1.  Each relation `r` is represented by two vectors: a normal vector `w_r` (defining the hyperplane) and a translation vector `d_r` (which lies on the hyperplane, i.e., `d_r ⊥ w_r`).\n2.  For a given triplet `(h, r, t)`, the entity embeddings `h` and `t` are first projected onto the hyperplane defined by `w_r`. The projection of an entity vector `v` onto this hyperplane can be conceptually represented as `v_⊥ = v - (v^T w_r)w_r` (assuming `w_r` is a unit vector).\n3.  The scoring function for a valid triplet aims to minimize the distance between the translated projected head and the projected tail:\n    `f(h, r, t) = || (h - (h^T w_r)w_r) + d_r - (t - (t^T w_r)w_r) ||`\n    where `||.||` denotes a distance metric (e.g., L1 or L2 norm).\n\n**New Direction: Yes**\nReasoning: This paper proposes a new *method path* within the existing research direction of translational knowledge graph embedding models. While TransE established the translation-based paradigm, TransH introduces a fundamentally different and more sophisticated way to model relations by incorporating relation-specific hyperplanes. This conceptual shift allows it to address complex mapping properties that TransE could not, thereby significantly enhancing the capacity of translational models and opening up new avenues for their improvement. It's not just an incremental tweak but a significant methodological innovation within its class.\n\n**Type: Methodology**"

      "abstract": "\n \n Knowledge graphs are useful for many artificial intelligence (AI) tasks. However, knowledge graphs often have missing facts. To populate the graphs, knowledge graph embedding models have been developed. Knowledge graph embedding models map entities and relations in a knowledge graph to a vector space and predict unknown triples by scoring candidate triples. TransE is the first translation-based method and it is well known because of its simplicity and efficiency for knowledge graph completion. It employs the principle that the differences between entity embeddings represent their relations. The principle seems very simple, but it can effectively capture the rules of a knowledge graph. However, TransE has a problem with its regularization. TransE forces entity embeddings to be on a sphere in the embedding vector space. This regularization warps the embeddings and makes it difficult for them to fulfill the abovementioned principle. The regularization also affects adversely the accuracies of the link predictions. On the other hand, regularization is important because entity embeddings diverge by negative sampling without it. This paper proposes a novel embedding model, TorusE, to solve the regularization problem. The principle of TransE can be defined on any Lie group. A torus, which is one of the compact Lie groups, can be chosen for the embedding space to avoid regularization. To the best of our knowledge, TorusE is the first model that embeds objects on other than a real or complex vector space, and this paper is the first to formally discuss the problem of regularization of TransE. Our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches such as TransE, DistMult and ComplEx on a standard link prediction task. We show that TorusE is scalable to large-size knowledge graphs and is faster than the original TransE.\n \n",

TransE forces entity embeddings onto a sphere in a real vector space, which warps the embeddings, making it difficult for them to accurately represent the `head + relation ≈ tail` principle and negatively impacting link prediction accuracy. While regularization is crucial to prevent embedding divergence, its current implementation in TransE is problematic.\n\n*   **Method Used:** TorusE proposes to embed entities and relations not in a real or complex vector space, but on a **Lie group**, specifically a **torus**. The core idea is that the translation principle of TransE can be naturally defined on any Lie group. By choosing a compact Lie group like a torus, the model intrinsically avoids the need for explicit regularization. The compactness of the torus prevents embeddings from diverging, thus solving the regularization problem without warping the embedding space.

This implies a scoring function using a distance metric on the torus, e.g., `score(h, r, t) = d_T(h \\oplus r, t)`, where `d_T` is a suitable distance metric on the torus and `\\oplus` is the group operation on the torus. The explicit regularization `||e||_2 = 1` is *avoided* due to the inherent compactness of the torus space.\n\n---\n\n**New Direction: Yes**\n\n**Reasoning:** This paper proposes a new research direction by fundamentally changing the underlying mathematical space for knowledge graph embeddings.

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) aims to learn representations for entities and relations. Most KGE models have gained great success, especially on extrapolation scenarios. Specifically, given an unseen triple (h, r, t), a trained model can still correctly predict t from (h, r, ?), or h from (?, r, t), such extrapolation ability is impressive. However, most existing KGE works focus on the design of delicate triple modeling function, which mainly tells us how to measure the plausibility of observed triples, but offers limited explanation of why the methods can extrapolate to unseen data, and what are the important factors to help KGE extrapolate. Therefore in this work, we attempt to study the KGE extrapolation of two problems: 1. How does KGE extrapolate to unseen data? 2. How to design the KGE model with better extrapolation ability? \nFor the problem 1, we first discuss the impact factors for extrapolation and from relation, entity and triple level respectively, propose three Semantic Evidences (SEs), which can be observed from train set and provide important semantic information for extrapolation. Then we verify the effectiveness of SEs through extensive experiments on several typical KGE methods.\nFor the problem 2, to make better use of the three levels of SE, we propose a novel GNN-based KGE model, called Semantic Evidence aware Graph Neural Network (SE-GNN). In SE-GNN, each level of SE is modeled explicitly by the corresponding neighbor pattern, and merged sufficiently by the multi-layer aggregation, which contributes to obtaining more extrapolative knowledge representation. \nFinally, through extensive experiments on FB15k-237 and WN18RR datasets, we show that SE-GNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on Knowledge Graph Completion task and performs a better extrapolation ability.

      "summary": "**Summary of Main Contribution:**\n\nThis paper addresses the problem of link prediction in knowledge graphs (KGs), which involves inferring missing relationships between entities. It proposes a novel method called \"logical-default attention graph convolution neural network\" (LDAGCN) for generating knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs). The core idea is to leverage graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to aggregate structural information from the KG, enhanced by a specialized \"logical-default attention\" mechanism. This attention mechanism likely aims to dynamically weigh the importance of neighboring entities and relations, potentially incorporating logical rules or default assumptions to improve the quality and interpretability of the learned embeddings. These high-quality embeddings are then used to predict missing links.\n\n**Key Findings (Inferred from Title, as Content is Missing):**\nWhile specific findings cannot be detailed without the paper's content, it is expected that the LDAGCN model would demonstrate superior performance on standard link prediction benchmarks (e.g., FB15k-237, WN18RR) compared to existing state-of-the-art KGE models. The paper would likely highlight improvements in metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hits@N, attributing these gains to the effective integration of logical-default attention within the GCN framework for learning more expressive and accurate knowledge graph embeddings.\n\n**Key Math Equations (Inferred from Title, as Content is Missing):**\nThe paper would likely present several key mathematical formulations, including:\n1.  **Graph Convolutional Layer:** A variant of the GCN propagation rule, adapted for KGs, which aggregates features from neighboring nodes:\n    $H^{(l+1)} = \\sigma(\\sum_{r \\in \\mathcal{R}} \\tilde{A}_r H^{(l)} W_r^{(l)} + b^{(l)})$\n    where $H^{(l)}$ is the entity embedding matrix at layer $l$, $\\tilde{A}_r$ is an adjacency matrix for relation type $r$, $W_r^{(l)}$ are learnable weight matrices, and $\\sigma$ is an activation function.\n2.  **Logical-Default Attention Mechanism:** The core novelty would be the specific formulation of the attention weights $\\alpha_{ij}$ for aggregating neighbor information. This would likely involve a function that computes attention scores based on entity features, relation types, and potentially incorporates logical predicates or default rules:\n    $\\alpha_{ij} = \\text{Attention}(h_i, h_j, r_{ij}, \\text{logical_context})$\n    These attention weights would then be used to weight the aggregated features in the GCN.\n3.  **Scoring Function for Link Prediction:** A function to score the plausibility of a triple $(h, r, t)$ based on their embeddings:\n    $s(h, r, t) = f(e_h, e_r, e_t)$ (e.g., distance-based, dot product, or a neural network).\n4.  **Loss Function:** A training objective, such as a margin-based ranking loss or negative sampling loss, to optimize the embeddings:\n    $\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{(h,r,t) \\in \\mathcal{T}} \\sum_{(h',r',t') \\in \\mathcal{T}'} \\max(0, \\gamma + s(h,r,t) - s(h',r',t'))$\n    where $\\mathcal{T}$ are positive triples, $\\mathcal{T}'$ are negative triples, and $\\gamma$ is a margin.\n\n---\n\n**New Direction: Yes**\n\n**Reasoning:**\nWhile the use of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and attention mechanisms for Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) and link prediction is an established research area, the specific term \"logical-default attention\" suggests a novel approach to integrating symbolic or rule-based reasoning within a neural attention mechanism. Standard attention mechanisms primarily learn statistical correlations. The inclusion of \"logical-default\" implies an attempt to:\n1.  **Incorporate explicit logical principles:** Guiding the attention mechanism to prioritize certain paths or relationships based on logical rules (e.g., transitivity, symmetry, inverse relations).\n2.  **Handle missing or uncertain information with defaults:** Providing a structured way for the model to make informed guesses or fallbacks when explicit information is absent, similar to default reasoning in AI.\n\nIf this \"logical-default attention\" mechanism significantly departs from purely data-driven attention by embedding a form of structured reasoning or rule-based inference directly into the attention weights, it represents a new method path. It pushes the boundary of hybrid AI, attempting to combine the strengths of neural networks (representation learning) with symbolic reasoning (logic and defaults) in a novel architectural component for KGE. This could open new avenues for developing more robust, interpretable, and reasoning-capable KGE models.\n\n---\n\n**Type: Methodology**"

      "summary": "**Problem:**\nThe paper addresses the challenge of effectively and efficiently learning embeddings for Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs). TKGs represent facts (entities and relations) that evolve over time. The core problem is to capture both the static structural information and the dynamic temporal evolution of the graph, allowing for accurate prediction and reasoning over time-sensitive data, often with considerations for the inherent sparsity and large scale of real-world TKGs.\n\n**Method Used to Solve It:**\nThe paper proposes a method that leverages a \"sparse transfer matrix.\" This approach likely involves:\n1.  **Temporal Evolution Modeling:** Using a transfer matrix to model how entity and relation embeddings evolve from one timestamp to the next. This matrix acts as a transformation function, capturing the temporal dependencies and changes in the graph.\n2.  **Sparsity for Efficiency:** The \"sparse\" nature of the transfer matrix is crucial for efficiency and scalability. It suggests that the method focuses on modeling only significant or observed transitions and changes between time steps, rather than dense computations across all possible interactions. This helps in handling large TKGs and potentially reduces noise by focusing on relevant temporal dynamics.\n3.  **Embedding Learning:** The overall framework would integrate this sparse transfer matrix into a TKG embedding model, where embeddings for entities and relations are learned such that they accurately reflect the TKG's structure and its evolution over time, guided by the sparse transfer matrix.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n(Based on inference from the title, as content is not provided)\nThe paper likely demonstrates that its proposed sparse transfer matrix approach:\n*   Achieves competitive or superior performance on TKG-specific tasks such as temporal link prediction, entity prediction, or temporal fact forecasting.\n*   Offers improved computational efficiency and scalability compared to existing TKG embedding methods, particularly when dealing with large and sparse temporal data, due to the sparse nature of the transfer matrix.\n*   Effectively captures the temporal dynamics and evolution of facts within the knowledge graph, leading to more accurate and robust temporal reasoning.\n\n**Key Math Equations:**\n(Cannot be provided without the paper's content.) The paper would likely introduce equations defining:\n*   The embedding function for entities and relations at a given timestamp.\n*   The mathematical formulation of the sparse transfer matrix, possibly involving matrix multiplication or transformation operations to update embeddings across time steps: e.g., $h_{t+1} = M_t h_t$, where $h_t$ is the embedding at time $t$ and $M_t$ is the sparse transfer matrix.\n*   A loss function that incorporates both static graph structure and temporal evolution, potentially with regularization terms to enforce sparsity on the transfer matrix.\n\n**New Direction Analysis:**\nNew Direction: No.\nReasoning: The paper operates within the established research area of Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) embedding. While it introduces a novel *method* (\"sparse transfer matrix\") to address the challenges within this field, it does not propose a fundamentally new research *direction* or paradigm. TKG embedding is a well-recognized problem, and various techniques exist to model temporal dynamics (e.g., recurrent neural networks, temporal convolutions, attention mechanisms). This paper contributes a specific, potentially more efficient or effective, *methodological path* within this existing direction, focusing on a particular mathematical construct (sparse transfer matrix) to model temporal transitions. It refines and improves upon existing approaches rather than opening up an entirely new area of inquiry.\n\n**Type:** Methodology"

      "abstract": "Answering complex First-Order Logical (FOL) queries on large-scale incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs) is an important yet challenging task. Recent advances embed logical queries and KG entities in the same space and conduct query answering via dense similarity search. However, most logical operators designed in previous studies do not satisfy the axiomatic system of classical logic, limiting their performance. Moreover, these logical operators are parameterized and thus require many complex FOL queries as training data, which are often arduous to collect or even inaccessible in most real-world KGs. We thus present FuzzQE, a fuzzy logic based logical query embedding framework for answering FOL queries over KGs. FuzzQE follows fuzzy logic to define logical operators in a principled and learning-free manner, where only entity and relation embeddings require learning. FuzzQE can further benefit from labeled complex logical queries for training. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that FuzzQE provides significantly better performance in answering FOL queries compared to state-of-the-art methods. In addition, FuzzQE trained with only KG link prediction can achieve comparable performance to those trained with extra complex query data.",

It highlights two key limitations of existing embedding-based methods: (1) their logical operators often fail to satisfy the axiomatic system of classical logic, hindering performance, and (2) these parameterized operators necessitate large amounts of complex FOL query training data, which is frequently difficult or impossible to acquire in real-world scenarios.\n\n**Method Used:**\nThe paper introduces **FuzzQE**, a fuzzy logic based logical query embedding framework. FuzzQE's core approach involves defining logical operators (e.g., conjunction, disjunction, negation) in a principled and learning-free manner, directly following the mathematical framework of fuzzy logic. This ensures axiomatic consistency for the operators. Unlike previous methods, only the entity and relation embeddings within the KG require learning, significantly reducing the reliance on complex query training data. While the operators are learning-free, FuzzQE can optionally benefit from labeled complex logical queries for further performance enhancement.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n*   FuzzQE demonstrates significantly superior performance in answering FOL queries compared to state-of-the-art methods across two benchmark datasets.\n*   A crucial finding is that FuzzQE, even when trained solely with KG link prediction (i.e., without any complex query data), achieves performance comparable to methods that rely on extensive complex query training data. This underscores its data efficiency and robustness.\n\n**Key Math Equations (if applicable):**\nWhile specific equations are not provided in the content, the core mathematical contribution lies in the *principled definition of logical operators based on fuzzy logic*. This involves leveraging established fuzzy logic operations such as t-norms (for conjunction), t-conorms (for disjunction), and fuzzy implication/negation functions, which provide a mathematically grounded framework for handling degrees of truth for logical operations.\n\n---\n\n**New Direction: Yes**\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThis paper proposes a new method path by introducing a fundamentally different approach to defining logical operators within the query embedding paradigm for KG query answering. Prior methods typically relied on parameterized, data-driven operators that often lacked axiomatic consistency and demanded extensive training data. FuzzQE, in contrast, offers a *principled, learning-free approach* by grounding these operators in fuzzy logic. This shift from purely empirical, data-dependent operator learning to an axiomatically-sound, fuzzy-logic-based definition represents a significant methodological departure. It addresses a core limitation of previous work (lack of axiomatic consistency and data hunger) with a novel theoretical and practical solution, thereby opening a new avenue for designing more robust and data-efficient logical query answering systems.\n\n---\n\n**Type: Methodology**"

      "title": "Towards Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding via Incremental Distillation",
      "abstract": "Traditional knowledge graph embedding (KGE) methods typically require preserving the entire knowledge graph (KG) with significant training costs when new knowledge emerges. To address this issue, the continual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) task has been proposed to train the KGE model by learning emerging knowledge efficiently while simultaneously preserving decent old knowledge. However, the explicit graph structure in KGs, which is critical for the above goal, has been heavily ignored by existing CKGE methods. On the one hand, existing methods usually learn new triples in a random order, destroying the inner structure of new KGs. On the other hand, old triples are preserved with equal priority, failing to alleviate catastrophic forgetting effectively. In this paper, we propose a competitive method for CKGE based on incremental distillation (IncDE), which considers the full use of the explicit graph structure in KGs. First, to optimize the learning order, we introduce a hierarchical strategy, ranking new triples for layer-by-layer learning. By employing the inter- and intra-hierarchical orders together, new triples are grouped into layers based on the graph structure features. Secondly, to preserve the old knowledge effectively, we devise a novel incremental distillation mechanism, which facilitates the seamless transfer of entity representations from the previous layer to the next one, promoting old knowledge preservation. Finally, we adopt a two-stage training paradigm to avoid the over-corruption of old knowledge influenced by under-trained new knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of IncDE over state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, the incremental distillation mechanism contributes to improvements of 0.2%-6.5% in the mean reciprocal rank (MRR) score. More exploratory experiments validate the effectiveness of IncDE in proficiently learning new knowledge while preserving old knowledge across all time steps.",

      "abstract": "Leveraging generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), we have transformed a dataset comprising 1000 scientific papers focused on biological materials into a comprehensive ontological knowledge graph. Through an in-depth structural analysis of this graph, we have calculated node degrees, identified communities along with their connectivities, and evaluated clustering coefficients and betweenness centrality of pivotal nodes, uncovering fascinating knowledge architectures. We find that the graph has an inherently scale-free nature, shows a high level of connectedness, and can be used as a rich source for downstream graph reasoning by taking advantage of transitive and isomorphic properties to reveal insights into unprecedented interdisciplinary relationships that can be used to answer queries, identify gaps in knowledge, propose never-before-seen material designs, and predict material behaviors. Using a large language embedding model we compute deep node representations and use combinatorial node similarity ranking to develop a path sampling strategy that allows us to link dissimilar concepts that have previously not been related. One comparison revealed detailed structural parallels between biological materials and Beethoven’s 9th Symphony, highlighting shared patterns of complexity through isomorphic mapping. In another example, the algorithm proposed an innovative hierarchical mycelium-based composite based on integrating path sampling with principles extracted from Kandinsky’s ‘Composition VII’ painting. The resulting material integrates an innovative set of concepts that include a balance of chaos and order, adjustable porosity, mechanical strength, and complex patterned chemical functionalization. We uncover other isomorphisms across science, technology and art, revealing a nuanced ontology of immanence that reveal a context-dependent heterarchical interplay of constituents. Because our method transcends established disciplinary boundaries through diverse data modalities (graphs, images, text, numerical data, etc), graph-based generative AI achieves a far higher degree of novelty, explorative capacity, and technical detail, than conventional approaches and establishes a widely useful framework for innovation by revealing hidden connections.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) is used to represent the relationships between different concepts in the real world. It is a special network in which nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships. KGs can intuitively model the connections between facts, but in many applications, there are certain limitations in directly using symbolic logic to represent knowledge in KGs and perform calculations, making it difficult to achieve expected results in downstream tasks. Meanwhile, with the explosive growth of Internet capacity, the traditional KG structure faces the problems of computational inefficiency and management difficulties. To alleviate these problems, Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is proposed to improve the computational efficiency by embedding entities and relations in the KG into a low-dimensional, dense and continuous vector space, and thus the solution of some problems in the knowledge graph is transformed into vector operations. Moreover, KGE also can be used as a pre-trained model which is more beneficial to downstream applications, such as applications based on deep learning. In this paper, we classify KGE into three categories, namely translational distance models, semantic matching models and neural network based models. The advantages and disadvantages of different embedding methods are compared, while the main applications of KGE are summarized.

Its main contribution is to systematically categorize, analyze, and summarize the field of KGE, offering a structured overview for researchers.\n\n**Problem Addressed:**\nThe paper addresses two primary problems:\n1.  **Limitations of Symbolic Logic:** Directly using symbolic logic for knowledge graph (KG) representation and computation faces limitations, making it difficult to achieve desired results in downstream tasks.\n2.  **Computational Inefficiency and Management Difficulties:** With the explosive growth of internet data, traditional KG structures struggle with computational inefficiency and management challenges.\n\n**Method Used to Solve It:**\nThe paper surveys Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) as the solution to these problems.

      "abstract": "Trajectory similarity computation serves as a fundamental functionality of various spatial information applications. Although existing deep learning similarity computation methods offer better efficiency and accuracy than non-learning solutions, they are still immature in trajectory embedding and suffer from poor generality and heavy preprocessing for training. Targeting these limitations, we propose a novel framework named KGTS based on knowledge graph grid embedding, prompt trajectory embedding, and unsupervised contrastive learning for improved trajectory similarity computation. Specifically, we first embed map grids with a GRot embedding method to vigorously grasp the neighbouring relations of grids. Then, a prompt trajectory embedding network incorporates the resulting grid embedding and extracts trajectory structure and point order information. It is trained by unsupervised contrastive learning, which not only alleviates the heavy preprocessing burden but also provides exceptional generality with creatively designed strategies for positive sample generation. The prompt trajectory embedding adopts a customized prompt paradigm to mitigate the gap between the grid embedding and the trajectory embedding.

These limitations include immaturity in trajectory embedding, poor generality across different datasets or scenarios, and the heavy preprocessing burden required for training.\n\n**Method Used:**\nThe paper proposes a novel framework named KGTS (Knowledge Graph Trajectory Similarity) to overcome these issues. KGTS integrates three main components:\n1.  **Knowledge Graph Grid Embedding:** It first embeds map grids using a GRot embedding method to effectively capture the neighboring relations between grids.\n2.  **Prompt Trajectory Embedding:** A prompt trajectory embedding network then incorporates these grid embeddings to extract trajectory structure and point order information. A customized \"prompt paradigm\" is employed to mitigate the representational gap between the grid embeddings and the trajectory embeddings.\n3.  **Unsupervised Contrastive Learning:** The prompt trajectory embedding network is trained using unsupervised contrastive learning.

While knowledge graphs, prompt learning, and contrastive learning exist individually, their specific integration within the KGTS framework for this problem is novel. The use of a \"customized prompt paradigm to mitigate the gap between the grid embedding and the trajectory embedding\" and the \"creatively designed strategies for positive sample generation\" within an unsupervised contrastive learning setup are specific methodological innovations. This is not merely an incremental improvement on an existing architecture but a novel architectural and training strategy that addresses fundamental limitations of prior approaches (generality, preprocessing burden) in a distinct way."

To address this challenge, we resort to analogical inference and propose a novel and general self-supervised framework AnKGE to enhance KGE models with analogical inference capability. We propose an analogical object retriever that retrieves appropriate analogical objects from entity-level, relation-level, and triple-level. And in AnKGE, we train an analogy function for each level of analogical inference with the original element embedding from a well-trained KGE model as input, which outputs the analogical object embedding. In order to combine inductive inference capability from the original KGE model and analogical inference capability enhanced by AnKGE, we interpolate the analogy score with the base model score and introduce the adaptive weights in the score function for prediction. Through extensive experiments on FB15k-237 and WN18RR datasets, we show that AnKGE achieves competitive results on link prediction task and well performs analogical inference.",

Conventional knowledge graph embedding methods map elements in a knowledge graph, including entities and relations, into continuous vector spaces by assigning them one or multiple specific embeddings (i.e., vector representations). Thus the number of embedding parameters increases linearly as the growth of knowledge graphs. In our proposed model, Entity-Agnostic Representation Learning (EARL), we only learn the embeddings for a small set of entities and refer to them as reserved entities. To obtain the embeddings for the full set of entities, we encode their distinguishable information from their connected relations, k-nearest reserved entities, and multi-hop neighbors. We learn universal and entity-agnostic encoders for transforming distinguishable information into entity embeddings.

EARL tackles the parameter efficiency problem by not learning specific embeddings for all entities. Instead, it:\n1.  Learns and stores embeddings for only a small, pre-defined subset of entities, referred to as \"reserved entities.\"\n2.

      "abstract": "Accurate prediction of future events brings great benefits and reduces losses for society in many domains, such as civil unrest, pandemics, and crimes. Knowledge graph is a general language for describing and modeling complex systems. Different types of events continually occur, which are often related to historical and concurrent events. In this paper, we formalize the future event prediction as a temporal knowledge graph reasoning problem. Most existing studies either conduct reasoning on static knowledge graphs or assume knowledges graphs of all timestamps are available during the training process. As a result, they cannot effectively reason over temporal knowledge graphs and predict events happening in the future. To address this problem, some recent works learn to infer future events based on historical event-based temporal knowledge graphs. However, these methods do not comprehensively consider the latent patterns and influences behind historical events and concurrent events simultaneously. This paper proposes a new graph representation learning model, namely Recurrent Event Graph ATtention Network (RE-GAT), based on a novel historical and concurrent events attention-aware mechanism by modeling the event knowledge graph sequence recurrently. More specifically, our RE-GAT uses an attention-based historical events embedding module to encode past events, and employs an attentionbased concurrent events embedding module to model the associations of events at the same timestamp. A translation-based decoder module and a learning objective are developed to optimize the embeddings of entities and relations. We evaluate our proposed method on four benchmark datasets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our RE-GAT model comparing to various baselines, which proves that our method can more accurately predict what events are going to happen.",

      "abstract": "In the realm of artificial intelligence, knowledge graphs (KGs) serve as an essential structured framework, capturing intricate relationships between diverse entities and supporting a broad spectrum of AI applications. Despite their utility, the static characteristic of KGs poses challenges in dynamically evolving information landscapes. This has catalyzed the development of temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs), which introduce a temporal layer to KGs, facilitating the representation of knowledge progression through time. This study zeroes in on the critical task of TKG extrapolation, which is vital for forecasting future occurrences and offering foresight into emerging situations across a variety of fields. Most contemporary approaches to TKG extrapolation are predicated on the symmetrical encoder–decoder paradigm, wherein the processes of representation learning and reasoning are harmoniously intertwined. While the encoder often garners the most attention due to its role in capturing and encoding information, the pivotal role of the decoder, which is often overlooked, is essential for direct inference and the accurate projection of temporal dynamics. To this end, we present the Householder-transformation-based temporal knowledge graph extrapolation (HTKGE) method: a groundbreaking encoder–decoder framework that reimagines the decoder’s contribution to TKG extrapolation. Our approach spotlights an adaptive decoder propelled by Householder transformations, which engage dynamically with the temporal encoding from the encoder. This interaction fosters a nuanced comprehension of the TKG’s temporal trajectory. Our empirical evaluations across four benchmark TKG datasets substantiate HTKGE’s consistent efficacy in TKG extrapolation tasks.",

      "abstract": "Entity alignment is the most critical technology of knowledge fusion, which aims to identify and align entities that exist in different knowledge graphs (KGs) but represent the same real-world objects. Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) extend static triples into quadruples by introducing temporal information, which is more in line with the dynamic changes of the real world and is often used to enhance the performance of various applications. However, the existing entity alignment methods mainly focus on traditional KGs, ignoring the temporal information contained in TKGs may lead to misalignment between some similar entities. The latest method enhances the performance of entity alignment by learning temporal information embedding, but it does not make full use of the advantages of temporal information. In this paper, we propose a new Entity Alignment method for Cross-lingual TKG with BERT (EACTB). EACTB uses the BERT model of multi-language training to learn the semantic relevance of entity description. For temporal information, we propose a new and more efficient method to calculate the similarity of temporal information. EACTB uses graph convolution network (GCN) to embed structural information. In addition, iterative method is used to deal with the problem of insufficient training datasets. Experimental results on three cross-lingual TKGs datasets show that EACTB is significantly superior to existing methods.",

      "title": "A Domain-Oriented Entity Alignment Approach Based on Filtering Multi-Type Graph Neural Networks",
      "abstract": "Owing to the heterogeneity and incomplete information present in various domain knowledge graphs, the alignment of distinct source entities that represent an identical real-world entity becomes imperative. Existing methods focus on cross-lingual knowledge graph alignment, and assume that the entities of knowledge graphs in the same language are unique. However, due to the ambiguity of language, heterogeneous knowledge graphs in the same language are often duplicated, and relationship triples are far less than those of cross-lingual knowledge graphs. Moreover, existing methods rarely exclude noisy entities in the process of alignment. These make it impossible for existing methods to deal effectively with the entity alignment of domain knowledge graphs. In order to address these issues, we propose a novel entity alignment approach based on domain-oriented embedded representation (DomainEA). Firstly, a filtering mechanism employs the language model to extract the semantic features of entities and to exclude noisy entities for each entity. Secondly, a Structural Aggregator (SA) incorporates multiple hidden layers to generate high-order neighborhood-aware embeddings of entities that have few relationship connections. An Attribute Aggregator (AA) introduces self-attention to dynamically calculate weights that represent the importance of the attribute values of the entities. Finally, the approach calculates a transformation matrix to map the embeddings of distinct domain knowledge graphs onto a unified space, and matches entities via the joint embeddings of the SA and AA. Compared to six state-of-the-art methods, our experimental results on multiple food datasets show the following: (i) Our approach achieves an average improvement of 6.9% on MRR. (ii) The size of the dataset has a subtle influence on our approach; there is a positive correlation between the expansion of the dataset size and an improvement in most of the metrics. (iii) We can achieve a significant improvement in the level of recall by employing a filtering mechanism that is limited to the top-100 nearest entities as the candidate pairs.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) is often introduced into recommendation systems because of its large amount of edge information. The method based on graph neural networks (GNNs) has gradually become the mainstream of KG-aware recommendation. However, traditional KG-aware recommendation models based on GNNs fail to utilize the dependencies of items and item attributes to model user preferences at a fine-grained level, which will result in a lack of interpretability in the model’s recommendations to users. In addition, traditional KG-aware recommendation models based on GNNs fail to mine supervision signals from the perspective of user preferences and item attributes, which will result in a lack of effective supervision signals in the model. In this study, we utilize a combination of items and attributes behind the items to model user preferences at a fine-grained level, so as to achieve independence between different user preferences. Furthermore, we utilize the KG and the user-item interaction graph (UIIG) to construct the user-specific preference similarity view and the item-specific attribute correlation views, respectively, and then apply the contrastive learning framework to effectively mine the association signals between users and between items. Based on this, we propose a novel model named Knowledge Graph Fine-grained Modeling Network with Contrastive Learning (KGFM-CL). Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate that KGFM-CL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models.",

      "abstract": "As a special type of Knowledge Graph (KG), Continual Knowledge Graph Learning (CKGL) plays a pivotal role in various areas such as recommendation systems, search engines, and personalized services, where knowledge dynamically evolves. A challenging problem in CKGL is catastrophic forgetting, where models forget previously learned knowledge upon being trained on new data. To overcome the challenge, this study proposes Flexible Memory Rotation (FMR), a dual-level regularization technique that focuses on both parameter level and structural level. Our idea is inspired by the natural human learning process, which tends to memorize correctly learned knowledge, leverage the learned to acquire new knowledge, and refine incorrectly learned knowledge with newly obtained information. Commonly, existing regularization-based methods fail to mimic this human nature by having a fixed constraint strategy for all model parameters. To this end, the proposed FMR offers flexible constraints based on qualities of learned knowledge evaluated by the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). Additionally, we identified a limitation of FIM in CKGL, which is the assumption of independence of time steps does not always hold. To overcome this, FMR rotates the parameter space to diagonalize the FIM. This work has four major contributions: 1) develop a novel regularization technique, FMR, a flexible regularization technique, 2) reveal the unexpected failure of FIM in CKGL and provides an easy remedy via parameter space rotation, 3) the comparison experiments on four benchmark datasets designed for CKGL demonstrates improvement over various state-of-the-art (SOTA) CKGL models, and 4) a comprehensive ablation study investigates each component of the proposed model.

      "abstract": "For natural language understanding and generation, embedding concepts using an order-based representation is an essential task. Unlike traditional point vector based representation, an order-based representation imposes geometric constraints on the representation vectors for explicitly capturing various semantic relationships that may exist between a pair of concepts. In existing literature, several approaches on order-based embedding have been proposed, mostly focusing on capturing hierarchical relationships; examples include vectors in Euclidean space, complex, Hyperbolic, order, and Box Embedding. Box embedding creates region-based rich representation of concepts, but along the process it sacrifices simplicity, requiring a custom-made optimization scheme for learning the representation. Hyperbolic embedding improves embedding quality by exploiting the ever-expanding property of Hyperbolic space, but it also suffers from the same fate as box embedding as gradient descent like optimization is not simple in the Hyperbolic space. In this work, we propose Binder, a novel approach for order-based representation. Binder uses binary vectors for embedding, so the embedding vectors are compact with an order of magnitude smaller footprint than other methods. Binder uses a simple and efficient optimization scheme for learning representation vectors with a linear time complexity. Our comprehensive experimental results show that Binder is very accurate, yielding competitive results on the representation task. But Binder stands out from its competitors on the transitive closure link prediction task as it can learn concept embeddings just from the direct edges, whereas all existing order-based approaches rely on the indirect edges. In particular, Binder achieves a whopping 70% higher F1-score than the second best method (98.6% vs 29%) in our largest dataset, WordNet Nouns (743,241 edges), when using only direct edges during training.",

      "abstract": "Relation prediction for knowledge graphs aims at predicting missing relationships between entities. Despite the importance of inductive relation prediction, most previous works are limited to a transductive setting and cannot process previously unseen entities. The recent proposed subgraph-based relation reasoning models provided alternatives to predict links from the subgraph structure surrounding a candidate triplet inductively. However, we observe that these methods often neglect the directed nature of the extracted subgraph and weaken the role of relation information in the subgraph modeling. As a result, they fail to effectively handle the asymmetric/anti-symmetric triplets and produce insufficient embeddings for the target triplets. To this end, we introduce a Communicative Message Passing neural network for Inductive reLation rEasoning, CoMPILE, that reasons over local directed subgraph structures and has a vigorous inductive bias to process entity-independent semantic relations. In contrast to existing models, CoMPILE strengthens the message interactions between edges and entitles through a communicative kernel and enables a sufficient flow of relation information. Moreover, we demonstrate that CoMPILE can naturally handle asymmetric/anti-symmetric relations without the need for explosively increasing the number of model parameters by extracting the directed enclosing subgraphs. Extensive experiments show substantial performance gains in comparison to state-of-the-art methods on commonly used benchmark datasets with variant inductive settings.",

To address this, this paper proposes an ontology embedding framework based on graph language models, named GLMSubs, aimed at enhancing the prediction of subclass relationships. The GLMSubs framework adopts a two-stage strategy of “multi-semantic view partitioning” and “advanced training of graph language models”. Initially, it deconstructs the ontology's concepts, attributes, and instance information into five types of semantic views, such as class hierarchy view and class-attribute relationship view, through a multi-view partitioning mechanism, comprehensively capturing information from different semantic dimensions. Subsequently, the framework employs graph language models for joint training on the multi-view data to obtain embeddings that integrate both semantic and structural information. Experiments on datasets such as FoodOn and GO validate the effectiveness of GLMSubs, demonstrating that its performance in class hierarchy relationship prediction tasks significantly surpasses existing methods.",

However, it is currently unclear to what extent the visual modality can improve the performance of knowledge graph tasks over unimodal models, and equally treating structural and visual features may encode too much irrelevant information from images. In this paper, we probe the utility of the auxiliary visual context from knowledge graph representation learning perspective by designing a Relation Sensitive Multi-modal Embedding model, RSME for short. RSME can automatically encourage or filter the influence of visual context during the representation learning. We also examine the effect of different visual feature encoders. Experimental results validate the superiority of our approach compared to the state-of-the-art methods. On the basis of in-depth analysis, we conclude that under appropriate circumstances models are capable of leveraging the visual input to generate better knowledge graph embeddings and vice versa.",

      "abstract": "Background Drug repurposing is an approach that holds promise for identifying new therapeutic uses for existing drugs. Recently, knowledge graphs have emerged as significant tools for addressing the challenges of drug repurposing. However, there are still major issues with constructing and embedding knowledge graphs. Results This study proposes a two-step method called DrugRep-HeSiaGraph to address these challenges. The method integrates the drug-disease knowledge graph with the application of a heterogeneous siamese neural network. In the first step, a drug-disease knowledge graph named DDKG-V1 is constructed by defining new relationship types, and then numerical vector representations for the nodes are created using the distributional learning method. In the second step, a heterogeneous siamese neural network called HeSiaNet is applied to enrich the embedding of drugs and diseases by bringing them closer in a new unified latent space. Then, it predicts potential drug candidates for diseases. DrugRep-HeSiaGraph achieves impressive performance metrics, including an AUC-ROC of 91.16%, an AUC-PR of 90.32%, an accuracy of 84.63%, a BS of 0.119, and an MCC of 69.31%. Conclusion We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in identifying potential drugs for COVID-19 as a case study. In addition, this study shows the role of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) as a potential receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and the effectiveness of DPP-4 inhibitors in facing COVID-19. This highlights the practical application of the model in addressing real-world challenges in the field of drug repurposing.

      "abstract": "Recent advances in knowledge representation learning (KRL) highlight the urgent necessity to unify symbolic knowledge graphs (KGs) with language models (LMs) for richer semantic understanding. However, existing approaches typically prioritize either graph structure or textual semantics, leaving a gap: a unified framework that simultaneously captures global KG connectivity, nuanced linguistic context, and discriminative reasoning semantics. To bridge this gap, we introduce KG-BiLM, a bidirectional LM framework that fuses structural cues from KGs with the semantic expressiveness of generative transformers. KG-BiLM incorporates three key components: (i) Bidirectional Knowledge Attention, which removes the causal mask to enable full interaction among all tokens and entities; (ii) Knowledge-Masked Prediction, which encourages the model to leverage both local semantic contexts and global graph connectivity; and (iii) Contrastive Graph Semantic Aggregation, which preserves KG structure via contrastive alignment of sampled sub-graph representations. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that KG-BiLM outperforms strong baselines in link prediction, especially on large-scale graphs with complex multi-hop relations - validating its effectiveness in unifying structural information and textual semantics.",

      "abstract": "Adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs) pose potential risks in polypharmacy due to unknown physicochemical incompatibilities between co-administered drugs. Recent studies have utilized multi-layer graph neural network architectures to model hierarchical molecular substructures of drugs, achieving excellent DDI prediction performance. While extant substructural frameworks effectively encode interactions from atom-level features, they overlook valuable chemical bond representations within molecular graphs. More critically, given the multifaceted nature of DDI prediction tasks involving both known and novel drug combinations, previous methods lack tailored strategies to address these distinct scenarios. The resulting lack of adaptability impedes further improvements to model performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose PEB-DDI, a DDI prediction learning framework with enhanced substructure extraction. First, the information of chemical bonds is integrated and synchronously updated with the atomic nodes. Then, different dual-view strategies are selected based on whether novel drugs are present in the prediction task. Particularly, we constructed Molecular fingerprint–Molecular graph view for transductive task, and Bipartite graph–Molecular graph view for inductive task. Rigorous evaluations on benchmark datasets underscore PEB-DDI's superior performance. Notably, on DrugBank, it achieves an outstanding accuracy rate of 98.18% when predicting previously unknown interactions among approved drugs. Even when faced with novel drugs, PEB-DDI consistently exhibits outstanding generalization capabilities with an accuracy rate of 88.06%, attributing to the proper migrating of molecular basic structure learning.",

Embedding methods like N2V are limited in their application on new nodes, which restricts them to the transductive setting where the entire graph, including the test nodes, is available during training. We propose inductive node2vec (iN2V), which combines a post-hoc procedure to compute embeddings for nodes unseen during training and modifications to the original N2V training procedure to prepare the embeddings for this post-hoc procedure. We conduct experiments on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that iN2V is an effective approach to bringing transductive embeddings to an inductive setting. Using iN2V embeddings improves node classification by 1 point on average, with up to 6 points of improvement depending on the dataset and the number of unseen nodes. Our iN2V is a plug-in approach to create new or enrich existing embeddings. It can also be combined with other embedding methods, making it a versatile approach for inductive node representation learning.

      "abstract": "With the rapid development of social networks, online and offline group activities are becoming more common and diverse. Considering the different interests of group members, the recommendation service for a group is more challenging than the common personalized recommendation. In essence, group recommendation interaction data is a typical heterogeneous graph structure. Therefore, the two challenges to this research are 1) how to learn the representation of groups, users, and items from interaction graphs and social relationship graphs, and 2) how to aggregate the representation of groups, users, and items from these graphs. In this research, we proposed a novel end-to-end Social enhancement Group Recommendation via Light graph convolution networks (SoLGR) to address those challenges. Specifically, we first utilize the meta-path to explore the potential social relationship from the user’s perspective. Afterward, SoLGR deploys a light graph convolution operation on interactive graphs and metapath-based graphs to aggregate the embedding of groups, users, and items on each graph. Finally, the representations of different layers are accumulated and used to achieve predictions for both groups and users. The experimental results show that our proposed model significantly improves the group recommendation performance on two real-world datasets.",

      "abstract": "This article proposes a directed knowledge graph inference model based on graph attention mechanism, aiming to solve the accuracy and efficiency problems in the knowledge graph inference process. Knowledge graph inference, as an important component of improving the quality of knowledge graphs, aims to explore potential entity relationships and complete the knowledge graph. However, traditional reasoning methods have limited effectiveness in handling large-scale knowledge graphs, especially in the context of increasing data volume and complex relationships, making existing methods inadequate. Therefore, this study introduces a model structure combining RED-GNN and GATv2, which improves the accuracy and efficiency of inference by dynamically capturing the structural information and global features of neighboring nodes. In addition, this chapter provides a detailed description of the various components of the model, including the recursive module, inference module, and evaluation module. Empirical experiments were conducted on multiple knowledge graph datasets to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The experimental results show that this model exhibits significant advantages in complex relational reasoning tasks, effectively balancing the accuracy and efficiency of reasoning, and providing new ideas and methods for the development of knowledge graph applications.",

      "abstract": "Recently, relational metric learning methods have been received great attention in recommendation community, which is inspired by the translation mechanism in knowledge graph. Different from the knowledge graph where the entity-to-entity relations are given in advance, historical interactions lack explicit relations between users and items in recommender systems. Currently, many researchers have succeeded in constructing the implicit relations to remit this issue. However, in previous work, the learning process of the induction function only depends on a single source of data (i.e., user-item interaction) in a supervised manner, resulting in the co-occurrence relation that is free of any semantic information. In this paper, to tackle the above problem in recommender systems, we propose a joint Semantic-Enhanced Relational Metric Learning (SERML) framework that incorporates the semantic information. Specifically, the semantic signal is first extracted from the target reviews containing abundant item features and personalized user preferences. A novel regression model is then designed via leveraging the extracted semantic signal to improve the discriminative ability of original relation-based training process. On four widely-used public datasets, experimental results demonstrate that SERML produces a competitive performance compared with several state-of-the-art methods in recommender systems.",

      "title": "On Large-scale Evaluation of Embedding Models for Knowledge Graph Completion",
      "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models are extensively studied for knowledge graph completion, yet their evaluation remains constrained by unrealistic benchmarks. Standard evaluation metrics rely on the closed-world assumption, which penalizes models for correctly predicting missing triples, contradicting the fundamental goals of link prediction. These metrics often compress accuracy assessment into a single value, obscuring models' specific strengths and weaknesses. The prevailing evaluation protocol, link prediction, operates under the unrealistic assumption that an entity's properties, for which values are to be predicted, are known in advance. While alternative protocols such as property prediction, entity-pair ranking, and triple classification address some of these limitations, they remain underutilized. Moreover, commonly used datasets are either faulty or too small to reflect real-world data. Few studies examine the role of mediator nodes, which are essential for modeling n-ary relationships, or investigate model performance variation across domains. This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of four representative KGE models on large-scale datasets FB-CVT-REV and FB+CVT-REV. Our analysis reveals critical insights, including substantial performance variations between small and large datasets, both in relative rankings and absolute metrics, systematic overestimation of model capabilities when n-ary relations are binarized, and fundamental limitations in current evaluation protocols and metrics.",

In addition, the complexity and large-scale of knowledge information hinder knowledge graph embedding performance of the classic graph convolutional network. In this paper, we analyzed the structural characteristics of knowledge graph and the imbalance of knowledge information. Complex knowledge information requires that the model should have better learnability, rather than linearly weighted qualitative constraints, so the method of end-to-end relation-enhanced learnable graph self-attention network for knowledge graphs embedding is proposed. Firstly, we construct the relation-enhanced adjacency matrix to consider the incompleteness of the knowledge graph. Secondly, the graph self-attention network is employed to obtain the global encoding and relevance ranking of entity node information. Thirdly, we propose the concept of convolutional knowledge subgraph, it is constructed according to the entity relevance ranking. Finally, we improve the training effect of the convKB model by changing the construction of negative samples to obtain a better reliability score in the decoder. The experimental results based on the data sets FB15k-237 and WN18RR show that the proposed method facilitates more comprehensive representation of knowledge information than the existing methods, in terms of Hits@10 and MRR.",

      "abstract": "Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) utilizes syndrome differentiation to formulate effective herbal prescriptions for treating complex diseases. Recently, some methods leveraging knowledge graph embedding and graph neural networks have shown promising performance. However, these approaches still straggle with challenges related to data quality, including sparsity and noise in knowledge graphs, as well as imbalances between positive and negative samples in datasets, which hinder performance improvements. To address these issues, our study introduces a novel approach integrating the Diffusion-Augmented Knowledge Graph Embedding and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with Asymmetric Loss (ASL). Firstly, we enhance herb representation by combining the Diffusion model with knowledge graph embedding to effectively mitigate noise and sparsity issues inherent in the knowledge graph. Then, we construct a TCM symptom-herb bipartite graph based on the dataset and employ a two-layer Bipartite Graph Convolutional Neural Network (Bipar GCN) to obtain feature embeddings. To tackle the imbalance between positive and negative samples, we introduce ASL to optimize the model. Finally, we aggregate symptom embeddings using MLP to derive a syndrome embedding, which is then multiplied with herb embeddings to compute prediction scores. Evaluated on a TCM prescription benchmark, our method outperforms others in Precision, Recall, and NDCG metrics, marking significant improvements in TCM prescription recommendation.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) has emerged as a promising solution to address the issue of incompleteness within Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Traditional KGC research primarily centers on triple classification and link prediction. Nevertheless, we contend that these tasks do not align well with real-world scenarios and merely serve as surrogate benchmarks. In this paper, we investigate three crucial processes relevant to real-world construction scenarios: (a) the verification process, which arises from the necessity and limitations of human verifiers; (b) the mining process, which identifies the most promising candidates for verification; and (c) the training process, which harnesses verified data for subsequent utilization; in order to achieve a transition toward more realistic challenges. By integrating these three processes, we introduce the Progressive Knowledge Graph Completion (PKGC) task, which simulates the gradual completion of KGs in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, to expedite PKGC processing, we propose two acceleration modules: Optimized Top-$k$ algorithm and Semantic Validity Filter. These modules significantly enhance the efficiency of the mining procedure. Our experiments demonstrate that performance in link prediction does not accurately reflect performance in PKGC. A more in-depth analysis reveals the key factors influencing the results and provides potential directions for future research.",

To address this, we propose the Gene-Metabolite Association Prediction task, which automates gene discovery for given metabolite-gene pairs, accompanied by a benchmark dataset of 2474 metabolites and 1947 genes for Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC) and Issatchenkia orientalis (IO). This task is complicated by incomplete metabolic graphs and metabolic heterogeneity. We introduce an Interactive Knowledge Transfer mechanism based on Metabolism Graphs (IKT4Meta) to enhance prediction accuracy by integrating cross-metabolism knowledge. Using Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) to generate inter-graph links mitigates heterogeneity issues, while intra-graph links are propagated via these anchors. Gene-metabolite predictions are then performed on the enriched graphs integrating multiple microorganisms’ knowledge. Experiments show that IKT4Meta outperforms baselines by up to 12.3% in link prediction.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph completion is an important task that aims to predict the missing relational link between entities. Knowledge graph embedding methods perform this task by representing entities and relations as embedding vectors and modeling their interactions to compute the matching score of each triple. Previous work has usually treated each embedding as a whole and has modeled the interactions between these whole embeddings, potentially making the model excessively expensive or requiring specially designed interaction mechanisms. In this work, we propose the multi-partition embedding interaction (MEI) model with block term format to systematically address this problem. MEI divides each embedding into a multi-partition vector to efficiently restrict the interactions. Each local interaction is modeled with the Tucker tensor format and the full interaction is modeled with the block term tensor format, enabling MEI to control the trade-off between expressiveness and computational cost, learn the interaction mechanisms from data automatically, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the link prediction task. In addition, we theoretically study the parameter efficiency problem and derive a simple empirically verified criterion for optimal parameter trade-off. We also apply the framework of MEI to provide a new generalized explanation for several specially designed interaction mechanisms in previous models.",

(2) Do the characteristics of Wikidata matter for the design of Entity Linking datasets and if so, how? (3) How do current Entity Linking approaches exploit the specific characteristics of Wikidata? (4) Which Wikidata characteristics are unexploited by existing Entity Linking approaches? This survey reveals that current Wikidata-specific Entity Linking datasets do not differ in their annotation scheme from schemes for other knowledge graphs like DBpedia. Thus, the potential for multilingual and time-dependent datasets, naturally suited for Wikidata, is not lifted. Furthermore, we show that most Entity Linking approaches use Wikidata in the same way as any other knowledge graph missing the chance to leverage Wikidata-specific characteristics to increase quality. Almost all approaches employ specific properties like labels and sometimes descriptions but ignore characteristics such as the hyper-relational structure. Hence, there is still room for improvement, for example, by including hyper-relational graph embeddings or type information. Many approaches also include information from Wikipedia, which is easily combinable with Wikidata and provides valuable textual information, which Wikidata lacks.",

For example, ComDensE is prone to overfitting and suffers from the degradation with the increase of network depth while InteractE has the limitations in feature interaction and interpretability. To this end, we propose a new method called dynamic sparse embedding (DSparsE) for knowledge graph completion. The proposed model embeds the input entity-relation pairs by a shallow encoder composed of a dynamic layer and a relation-aware layer. Subsequently, the concatenated output of the dynamic layer and relation-aware layer is passed through a projection layer and a deep decoder with residual connection structure. This model ensures the network robustness and maintains the capability of feature extraction. Furthermore, the conventional dense layers are replaced by randomly initialized sparse connection layers in the proposed method, which can mitigate the model overfitting. Finally, comprehensive experiments are conducted on the datasets of FB15k-237, WN18RR and YAGO3-10. It was demonstrated that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance in terms of Hits@1 compared to the existing baseline approaches. An ablation study is performed to examine the effects of the dynamic layer and relation-aware layer, where the combined model achieves the best performance.",

Normed space embeddings significantly outperform several popular manifolds on a large range of synthetic and real-world graph reconstruction benchmark datasets while requiring significantly fewer computational resources. We also empirically verify the superiority of normed space embeddings on growing families of graphs associated with negative, zero, and positive curvature, further reinforcing the flexibility of normed spaces in capturing diverse graph structures as graph sizes increase. Lastly, we demonstrate the utility of normed space embeddings on two applied graph embedding tasks, namely, link prediction and recommender systems. Our work highlights the potential of normed spaces for geometric graph representation learning, raises new research questions, and offers a valuable tool for experimental mathematics in the field of finite metric space embeddings.

We conducted comprehensive comparisons with several different knowledge graph embedding methods to validate the effectiveness of our KG-MRI model.

      "abstract": "Multi-hop logical reasoning over knowledge graph (KG) plays a fundamental role in many artificial intelligence tasks. Recent complex query embedding (CQE) methods for reasoning focus on static KGs, while temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) have not been fully explored. Reasoning over TKGs has two challenges: 1. The query should answer entities or timestamps; 2. The operators should consider both set logic on entity set and temporal logic on timestamp set. To bridge this gap, we define the multi-hop logical reasoning problem on TKGs. With generated three datasets, we propose the first temporal CQE named Temporal Feature-Logic Embedding framework (TFLEX) to answer the temporal complex queries. We utilize vector logic to compute the logic part of Temporal Feature-Logic embeddings, thus naturally modeling all First-Order Logic (FOL) operations on entity set. In addition, our framework extends vector logic on timestamp set to cope with three extra temporal operators (After, Before and Between). Experiments on numerous query patterns demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) are widely acknowledged as incomplete, and new entities are constantly emerging in the real world. Inductive KG reasoning aims to predict missing facts for these new entities. Among existing models, graph neural networks (GNNs) based ones have shown promising performance for this task. However, they are still challenged by inefficient message propagation due to the distance and scalability issues. In this paper, we propose a new inductive KG reasoning model, MStar, by leveraging conditional message passing neural networks (C-MPNNs). Our key insight is to select multiple query-specific starting entities to expand the scope of progressive propagation. To propagate query-related messages to a farther area within limited steps, we subsequently design a highway layer to propagate information toward these selected starting entities. Moreover, we introduce a training strategy called LinkVerify to mitigate the impact of noisy training samples. Experimental results validate that MStar achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art models, especially for distant entities.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA) aims to answer the image-aware question via the external knowledge, which requires an agent to not only understand images but also explicitly retrieve and integrate knowledge facts. Intuitively, to accurately answer the question, we humans can validate the retrieved knowledge based on our memory, and then align the knowledge facts with the image regions to infer answers. However, most existing methods ignore the process of knowledge validation and alignment. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Modal Validation and Domain Interaction Learning method, which consists of two components: 1) Multi-modal validation for knowledge retrieval. We propose the multi-modal validation module (MMV) to evaluate the confidence of each retrieved knowledge fact via images and questions, which preserves knowledge candidates effective for inferring answers. 2) Domain interaction for knowledge integration. We propose the Domain Interaction TRansformer module (DI-TR) to align visual regions with knowledge facts by the interaction learning in the improved transformer. Specifically, the inter-domain and intra-domain masks are injected into each self-attention layer to control the integration scope. The proposed method outperforms several strong baselines on three widely-used knowledge-based datasets: KRVQA, OK-VQA and VQA2.0. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-modal knowledge validation and domain interaction learning.",

We use a reinforcement learning based knowledge graph completion model combined with an automatic filtering approach that produces the most relevant rules and biological paths explaining the predicted drug’s therapeutic connection to the disease. In this work we validate the approach against preclinical experimental data for Fragile X syndrome demonstrating strong correlation between automatically extracted paths and experimentally derived transcriptional changes of selected genes and pathways of drug predictions Sulindac and Ibudilast.

      "abstract": "Recommendation systems are designed to uncover users’ potential preferences and make recommendations. However, they often face challenges such as data sparsity and the cold start problem. Although the introduction of knowledge graphs has partially addressed the issue of data sparsity, the challenge of cold start has not been effectively resolved. In this paper, a novel approach called Social Perception with Graph Attention Network (SPGAT) for Recommendation is proposed. In SPGAT, we aim to leverage social perception to solve the cold start effectively for more accurate recommendations. The approach utilizes a multi-layer graph attention network to aggregate user preference features from collaborative knowledge graphs and social perception graphs. By analyzing the social network of a new user, associated friend users can be identified. The interaction data of these friend users is then provided as side information to recommend to the new user. To handle one-to-many and many-to-many relations, we introduce the TransD graph embedding model, which maps different types of relations and entities to different spaces. To optimize the proposed SPGAT, self-adversarial negative sampling is utilized to implement entity and relation embedding and generate negative samples. Experimental results demonstrate that SPGAT has achieved superior performance compared to several advanced methods.",

For the last 6 years, this property has been widely explored in deep neural networks. Currently, the state-of-the-art in Deep Learning is represented by neural attention models in several application domains. This survey provides a comprehensive overview and analysis of developments in neural attention models. We systematically reviewed hundreds of architectures in the area, identifying and discussing those in which attention has shown a significant impact. We also developed and made public an automated methodology to facilitate the development of reviews in the area. By critically analyzing 650 works, we describe the primary uses of attention in convolutional, recurrent networks, and generative models, identifying common subgroups of uses and applications. Furthermore, we describe the impact of attention in different application domains and their impact on neural networks’ interpretability. Finally, we list possible trends and opportunities for further research, hoping that this review will provide a succinct overview of the main attentional models in the area and guide researchers in developing future approaches that will drive further improvements.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) provide a structured representation of knowledge but often suffer from challenges of incompleteness. To address this, link prediction or knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to infer missing new facts based on existing facts in KGs. Previous knowledge graph embedding models are limited in their ability to capture expressive features, especially when compared to deeper, multi-layer models. These approaches also assign a single static embedding to each entity and relation, disregarding the fact that entities and relations can exhibit different behaviors in varying graph contexts. Due to complex context over a fact triple of a KG, existing methods have to leverage complex non-linear context encoder, like transformer, to project entity and relation into low dimensional representations, resulting in high computation cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose Triple Receptance Perception (TRP) architecture to model sequential information, enabling the learning of dynamic context of entities and relations. Then we use tensor decomposition to calculate triple scores, providing robust relational decoding capabilities. This integration allows for more expressive representations. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as YAGO3-10, UMLS, FB15k, and FB13 in link prediction and triple classification tasks demonstrate that our method performs better than several state-of-the-art models, proving the effectiveness of the integration.",

      "abstract": "Modeling knowledge graph completion by encoding each entity and relation into a continuous tensor space becomes very hot. Meanwhile, many models including TransE, TransH, TransR, CTransR, TransD, TranSpare, TransDR, STransE, DT, FT and OrbitE are proposed for knowledge graph completion. However, all these previous works take less attention to the asymmetrical and the imbalance of many relations (some relations link a subject and many objects, and other relations link many subjects and many objects). Therefore, this paper proposes a novel asymmetrical embedding model(AEM) for knowledge graph completion. Because of the different properties of the head and tail entities in the triplets of the same relationship, every head entity vector and every tail entity vector are weighted by the corresponding head relation vector and the corresponding tail relation vector, respectively. And then new entity vector representations are obtained and the new entity vectors in the same triple are similar. Because the AEM weights each dimension of the entity vectors, it can accurately represent the latent attributes of entities and relationships. Moreover, the number of parameters of the AEM is so small that it is easier to train. Finally, compared with previous embedding models, the AEM obtains a better link prediction performance through two benchmark datasets FB15K and WN18.",

In addition, due to the heterogeneity between text and images, there is often semantic conflict, and directly fusing information from different modalities makes it difficult to accurately capture the deep associations between text and images. Therefore, we propose a multimodal knowledge graph completion method based on relationship path enhancement with multi feature deep fusion. This method identifies and strengthens key relationship paths, while also deeply mining the deep semantic connections between multiple modalities, achieving deep integration between multiple features.

Region-based embedding models usually embed entities as points and relations as geometric regions to accomplish the task.

      "abstract": "Reliable fault diagnosis in railway operational equipment is critical to ensuring system safety, operational efficiency, and predictive maintenance. Existing methods struggle to capture the intricate interdependencies among fault causes, failure modes, and corrective actions, limiting their ability to model fault propagation effectively. To address this, we propose TH-RotatE, a novel knowledge graph (KG) embedding framework that integrates TransH’s hierarchical modeling with RotatE’s complex space transformations, while incorporating a hybrid scoring function and self-adversarial negative sampling to enhance embedding quality and fault relationship differentiation. This approach effectively captures hierarchical dependencies, cyclic patterns, and asymmetric transitions inherent in railway faults, enabling a more expressive representation of fault propagation. Furthermore, we construct the Chinese railway operational equipment fault knowledge graph (CROEFKG), a structured multi-relational repository encoding fault descriptions, causal chains, and mitigation strategies. Extensive experiments on real-world railway fault data demonstrate that TH-RotatE outperforms both traditional and advanced KG embedding models, achieving superior fault diagnosis accuracy and link prediction effectiveness. In practical applications, TH-RotatE enables timely fault diagnosis and detection of cascading failures, providing interpretable fault propagation pathways through the CROEFKG’s structured representation. These capabilities offer a scalable, knowledge-driven solution for railway systems, improving diagnostic accuracy while reducing safety risks and unplanned downtime. This work advances domain-specific KG embeddings, bridging the gap between theoretical innovation and industrial reliability.",

      "title": "Start From Zero: Triple Set Prediction for Automatic Knowledge Graph Completion",
      "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) completion aims to find out missing triples in a KG. Some tasks, such as link prediction and instance completion, have been proposed for KG completion. They are triple-level tasks with some elements in a missing triple given to predict the missing element of the triple. However, knowing some elements of the missing triple in advance is not always a realistic setting. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-level automatic KG completion task called Triple Set Prediction (TSP) which assumes none of the elements in the missing triples is given. TSP is to predict a set of missing triples given a set of known triples. To properly and accurately evaluate this new task, we propose 4 evaluation metrics including 3 classification metrics and 1 ranking metric, considering both the partial-open-world and the closed-world assumptions. Furthermore, to tackle the huge candidate triples for prediction, we propose a novel and efficient subgraph-based method GPHT that can predict the triple set fast. To fairly compare the TSP results, we also propose two types of methods RuleTensor-TSP and KGE-TSP applying the existing rule- and embedding-based methods for TSP as baselines. During experiments, we evaluate the proposed methods on two datasets extracted from Wikidata following the relation-similarity partial-open-world assumption proposed by us, and also create a complete family data set to evaluate TSP results following the closed-world assumption. Results prove that the methods can successfully generate a set of missing triples and achieve reasonable scores on the new task, and GPHTperforms better than the baselines with significantly shorter prediction time.",

      "abstract": "Product search is crucial for users to find and purchase products they need. Personalized product search, which models users’ search intent and provides tailored results, has become a prominent research problem in industry and academia. Recent studies often leverage knowledge graphs (KGs) to improve search performance and generate explanations for search results. However, existing KG-based methods treat search and explanation tasks separately and explore paths in KGs as explanations, creating a gap between search results and generated explanations. Also, path-formed explanations in KGs are not flexible enough to build correlations with the user’s current query. To address these challenges, we propose P-PEG, a unified prompt-aware framework for personalized product search and explanation generation. P-PEG leverages a pre-trained language model (PLM) and search signal to enhance the generation of user-understandable explanations. We introduce a prompt learning technique and design prompt generators for search and explanation generation tasks based on a fixed PLM. By incorporating search results in explanation-based prompts, we bridge the gap between search results and explanations, facilitating better interaction. Additionally, we utilize the user’s current query, historical search log, and KGs to personalize the explanations and inject task knowledge into PLM. Experimental results show that P-PEG outperforms existing methods in the explanation generation task of the three datasets and the search task of the Electronics dataset, and achieves comparable performance in the search task of the Cellphones & Accessories and CD & Vinyl datasets.",

The basic idea of LoD is relation diffusion and sampling sub-logic by random walking as well as a special training mechanism called gradient adaption. Besides, LoD is accompanied by a novel loss function to further achieve the robust logical diffusion when facing noisy data in training or testing sets. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of mainstream knowledge graph reasoning models with LoD over state-of-the-art. Moreover, our ablation study proves the general effectiveness of LoD on the noise-rich knowledge graph.",

Recent studies propose deep learning models to approximate conventional trajectory similarity measures, exploiting their fast inference time once trained. Although efficient inference has been reported, challenges remain in similarity approximation accuracy due to difficulties in trajectory granularity modeling and in exploiting similarity signals in the training data. To fill this gap, we propose TSMini, a highly effective trajectory similarity model with a sub-view modeling mechanism capable of learning multi-granularity trajectory patterns and a k nearest neighbor-based loss that guides TSMini to learn not only absolute similarity values between trajectories but also their relative similarity ranks. Together, these two innovations enable highly accurate trajectory similarity approximation. Experiments show that TSMini can outperform the state-of-the-art models by 22% in accuracy on average when learning trajectory similarity measures.",

However, in domains where data is scarce or sensitive, ML models often exhibit sub-optimal performance. Our hypothesis is that semantically enriching the available training dataset can enhance the predictive power of ML models, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. To investigate this hypothesis, we propose novel neuro-symbolic approaches that augment tabular data with knowledge graph (KG) information, providing additional context and structure to improve model performance. Concretely, we introduce and examine several integration techniques of KG information through embeddings and explore how different KG embedding algorithms affect model performance, with a specific focus on accuracy and F2 scores. Our evaluation involves four distinct ML algorithms and four KG embedding techniques. We apply our approach to binary classification tasks on tabular data, including heart disease and chronic kidney disease. Our experimental results show improvements in performance particularly when tabular data is augmented with distance features computed in the embedding space. Notably, we achieve gains in F2 scores, such as an increase in XGBoost performance from 75.19% to 90.85% for heart disease prediction. These findings demonstrate the potential of KG-based augmentation to enhance ML performance.",

While recent studies have shown promising results in inferring such entities through knowledge subgraph reasoning, they suffer from (i) the semantic inconsistencies of similar relations, and (ii) noisy interactions inherent in KGs due to the presence of unconvincing knowledge for emerging entities. To address these challenges, we propose a Semantic Structure-aware Denoising Network (S$^2$DN) for inductive KGC. Our goal is to learn adaptable general semantics and reliable structures to distill consistent semantic knowledge while preserving reliable interactions within KGs. Specifically, we introduce a semantic smoothing module over the enclosing subgraphs to retain the universal semantic knowledge of relations. We incorporate a structure refining module to filter out unreliable interactions and offer additional knowledge, retaining robust structure surrounding target links. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark KGs demonstrate that S$^2$DN surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art models. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of S$^2$DN in preserving semantic consistency and enhancing the robustness of filtering out unreliable interactions in contaminated KGs.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) store human knowledge in the form of entities (nodes) and relations, and are used extensively in various applications. KG embeddings are an effective approach to addressing tasks like knowledge discovery, link prediction, and reasoning. This is often done by allocating and learning embedding tables for all or a subset of the entities. As this scales linearly with the number of entities, learning embedding models in real-world KGs with millions of nodes can be computationally intractable. To address this scalability problem, our model, PathE, only allocates embedding tables for relations (which are typically orders of magnitude fewer than the entities) and requires less than 25% of the parameters of previous parameter efficient methods. Rather than storing entity embeddings, we learn to compute them by leveraging multiple entity-relation paths to contextualise individual entities within triples. Evaluated on four benchmarks, PathE achieves state-of-the-art performance in relation prediction, and remains competitive in link prediction on path-rich KGs while training on consumer-grade hardware. We perform ablation experiments to test our design choices and analyse the sensitivity of the model to key hyper-parameters. PathE is efficient and cost-effective for relationally diverse and well-connected KGs commonly found in real-world applications.",

The model consists of two layers: the bottom layer is used to learn the interaction features between the source entity and its neighborhood with respect to relations, while the top layer is responsible for aggregating contextual information from the outputs of the bottom layer. This dual-layer design effectively balances feature information from both the source entity and its neighboring entities.

As a result, the direction of research on knowledge reasoning has shifted. Two critical issues in knowledge reasoning research are the algorithm of the model itself and the selection of paths. Most studies utilize LSTM as the path encoder and memory module. However, when processing long sequence data, LSTM models may encounter the problem of long-term dependencies, where memory units of the model may decay gradually with an increase in time steps, leading to forgetting earlier input information. This can result in a decline in the performance of the LSTM model in long sequence data. Additionally, as the data volume and network depth increase, there is a risk of gradient disappearance. This study improved and optimized the LSTM model to effectively address the problems of gradient explosion and gradient disappearance. An attention layer was employed to alleviate the issue of long-term dependencies, and ConvR embedding was used to guide path selection and action pruning in the reinforcement learning inference model. The overall model achieved excellent reasoning results.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to alleviate the inherent incompleteness of knowledge graphs (KGs), which is a critical task for various applications, such as recommendations on the web. Although knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models have demonstrated superior predictive performance on KGC tasks, these models infer missing links in a black-box manner that lacks transparency and accountability, preventing researchers from developing accountable models. Existing KGE-based explanation methods focus on exploring key paths or isolated edges as explanations, which is information-less to reason target prediction. Additionally, the missing ground truth leads to these explanation methods being ineffective in quantitatively evaluating explored explanations. To overcome these limitations, we propose KGExplainer, a model-agnostic method that identifies connected subgraph explanations and distills an evaluator to assess them quantitatively. KGExplainer employs a perturbation-based greedy search algorithm to find key connected subgraphs as explanations within the local structure of target predictions. To evaluate the quality of the explored explanations, KGExplainer distills an evaluator from the target KGE model. By forwarding the explanations to the evaluator, our method can examine the fidelity of them. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that KGExplainer yields promising improvement and achieves an optimal ratio of 83.3% in human evaluation.",

Fortunately, inter-dependent knowledge across papers provides rich potential heterogeneous connections for author–paper interactions, offering much insights for learning authors’ research interests. Therefore, we propose a meta-relation–guided knowledge coupling approach for paper recommendation. Specifically, we construct a meta-relation–guided heterogeneous graph architecture to depict the numerous inter-dependencies among authors and papers, thereby exploring complex author–paper interactions. First, a meta-relation–aware heterogeneous graph encoder is developed to extract relational structure which maintains the relation-specific representation of authors’ research interest and papers’ research relatedness. Then, a cross-meta-path attention network is designed to aggregate the characteristics of different meta-relations and obtain research features of authors and papers. Finally, a self-supervised data augmentation architecture is constructed to mine and preserve local and global graph structure information, acquiring papers with high relevance to author’s research interests through training loss. Numerous experiments are conducted on two real academic datasets, effectively demonstrating the superiority of our proposed model and validating its effectiveness in paper recommendation.",

      "abstract": "We study the problem of learning representations of entities and relations in knowledge graphs for predicting missing links. The success of such a task heavily relies on the ability of modeling and inferring the patterns of (or between) the relations. In this paper, we present a new approach for knowledge graph embedding called RotatE, which is able to model and infer various relation patterns including: symmetry/antisymmetry, inversion, and composition. Specifically, the RotatE model defines each relation as a rotation from the source entity to the target entity in the complex vector space. In addition, we propose a novel self-adversarial negative sampling technique for efficiently and effectively training the RotatE model. Experimental results on multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that the proposed RotatE model is not only scalable, but also able to infer and model various relation patterns and significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art models for link prediction.",

      "abstract": "Accurately predicting Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) is a critical and challenging aspect of the drug discovery process, particularly in preventing adverse reactions in patients undergoing combination therapy. However, current DDI prediction methods often overlook the interaction information between chemical substructures of drugs, focusing solely on the interaction information between drugs and failing to capture sufficient chemical substructure details. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel DDI prediction method: Multi-layer Adaptive Soft Mask Graph Neural Network (MASMDDI). Specifically, we first design a multi-layer adaptive soft mask graph neural network to extract substructures from molecular graphs. Second, we employ an attention mechanism to mine substructure feature information and update latent features. In this process, to optimize the final feature representation, we decompose drug-drug interactions into pairwise interaction correlations between the core substructures of each drug. Third, we use these features to predict the interaction probabilities of DDI tuples and evaluate the model using real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in DDI prediction. Furthermore, MASMDDI exhibits excellent performance in predicting DDIs of unknown drugs in two tasks that are more aligned with real-world scenarios. In particular, in the transductive scenario using the DrugBank dataset, the ACC and AUROC and AUPRC scores of MASMDDI are 0.9596, 0.9903, and 0.9894, which are 2% higher than the best performing baseline.",

Some recent studies have shown that Graph Neural Networks (GNN) can perform well on KGC. Most of the existing GNN models represent and update nodes by learning information from entities and relations in the subject domain through complex network structures, but they ignore the semantic information between relations. Graph Attention Networks (GAT) focuses on modeling simple relational graph data. This limits its ability to handle more general and complex multi-relational graphs. So, in this paper, we propose a relation encoding aware attention network (REA-GAT). By encoding relations, the relationship representation between different relations is updated. The interaction between entity embeddings and relation embeddings is further increased to make full use of neighborhood information and relation information to enrich the embeddings. Experiments show that REA-GAT has more advanced performance on link prediction tasks.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs have important applications for many computational tasks, such as personalized recommendations, information search, and natural language processing. Knowledge graph embedding, which is to learn representations of nodes and relations, is very critical to facilitate these applications and thus has been studied extensively in the literature. Most existing knowledge graphs (e.g., Freebase) have a data scarcity issue, i.e., the number of observed triplets is much less than that of all possible pairs of nodes. While the data augmentation technique has been widely applied to addressing data scarcity in other domains (e.g., image data), there are few prior studies exploring it for knowledge graph embedding probably because the discrete data structure of knowledge graphs prohibits the employment of most data augmentation methods. To fill this research gap, this paper introduces a novel data augmentation framework, namely knowledge graph mixup (KG Mixup), to enhance knowledge graph embedding. Based on the proposed framework, we develop two specific methods: vanilla mixup and influence mixup. Both approaches generate virtual mixup triplets and incorporate them into the learning process through a new mixup loss function. While vanilla mixup generates virtual triplets based on a uniform distribution, the influence mixup approach employs the influence function to guide the generation of mixup samples. Experiments with multiple datasets have shown that both approaches significantly outperform knowledge graph embedding models trained by the ordinary training framework.",

      "abstract": "Embedding-based Retrieval (EBR) has been a fundamental component in sponsored-search systems, which retrieves high-quality products for the user's search query by encoding the information of the query, user and product into dense embeddings. However, due to the characteristic of location-based service, the user input queries suffer from two extremes: overly brief queries with vague intentions and lengthy queries with substantial noise, both of which make it challenging to discern the exact user search intent. In fact, the e-consumers typically have a mental imagery of the product they intend to search for, reflecting their specific purchasing intentions. In this paper, we propose a Visual Imagination Enhanced Retrieval model (VIER) to explore the implicit imagery of users. Specifically, we design a visual imagination network to reconstruct the imagery embeddings that capture both coarse-grained query commonalities and fine-grained user personalities. These pseudo-image representations are integrated with the query and user behavior to enhance the understanding of user search intentions for improved retrieval.

Although new entities can be integrated by retraining the model from scratch in principle, such an approach is infeasible for large-scale KGs, where retraining is expensive and new entities may arise frequently. In this paper, we propose and describe a large-scale benchmark to evaluate semi-inductive LP models. The benchmark is based on and extends Wikidata5M: It provides transductive, k-shot, and 0-shot LP tasks, each varying the available information from (i) only KG structure, to (ii) including textual mentions, and (iii) detailed descriptions of the entities. We report on a small study of recent approaches and found that semi-inductive LP performance is far from transductive performance on long-tail entities throughout all experiments. The benchmark provides a test bed for further research into integrating context and textual information in semi-inductive LP models.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) often suffer from incompleteness and this issue motivates the task of Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC). Traditional KGC models mainly concentrate on static KGs with a fixed set of entities and relations, or dynamic KGs with temporal characteristics, faltering in their generalization to constantly evolving KGs with possible irregular entity drift. Thus, in this article, we propose a novel link prediction model based on the embedding representation to handle the incompleteness of KGs with entity drift, termed as DCEL. Unlike traditional link prediction, DCEL could generate precise embeddings for drifted entity without imposing any regular temporal characteristic. The drifted entity is added into the KG with its links to the existing entity predicted in an incremental fashion with no requirement to retrain the whole KG for computational efficiency. In terms of DCEL model, it fully takes advantages of unstructured textual description, and is composed of four modules, namely Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC), Relation Constraint Attentive Aggregator (RCAA), Relation-Specific Alignment (RSA), and Relation Constraint Embedding Optimization (RCEO). Specifically, the MRC module is first employed to extract short texts from long and redundant descriptions. Then, RCAA is used to aggregate the embeddings of textual description of drifted entity and the pre-trained word embeddings learned from corpus to a single text-based entity embedding while shielding the impact of noise and irrelevant information. After that, RSA is applied to align the text-based entity embedding to graph-based space to obtain the corresponding graph-based entity embedding, and then the learned embeddings are fed into the gate structure to be optimized based on the RCEO to improve the accuracy of representation learning. Finally, the graph-based model TransE is used to perform link prediction for drifted entity. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets in terms of evaluation protocols of MRR and Hits@k reveal the superiority of DCEL model compared to its SOTAs.",

As a result, they are better suited to batch data or smaller datasets. Furthermore, the application of network-based methods in multi-omics often relies on similarity-based networks, which lack structurally-discrete topologies. This limitation may reduce the effectiveness of graph-based methods that were initially designed for topologies with better defined structures. Results: We propose Subset-Contrastive multi-Omics Network Embedding (SCONE), a method that employs contrastive learning techniques on large datasets through a scalable subgraph contrastive approach. By exploiting the pairwise similarity basis of many network-based omics methods, we transformed this characteristic into a strength, developing an approach that aims to achieve scalable and effective analysis. Our method demonstrates synergistic omics integration for cell type clustering in single-cell data. Additionally, we evaluate its performance in a bulk multi-omics integration scenario, where SCONE performs comparable to the state-of-the-art despite utilising limited views of the original data. We anticipate that our findings will motivate further research into the use of subset contrastive methods for omics data.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) are widely used in various fields. However, current available knowledge graph embedding models struggle to effectively capture the connections between entities and their physical properties within the knowledge graph. To enhance the model's representation and embedding capabilities, the input space should accurately reflect the connective features within the knowledge graph. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel knowledge graph chaining prediction algorithm-the Chained Prediction Algorithm for Multi-Spatial Knowledge Graphs (CP A-MSKG). This algorithm effectively improves the representation capability of knowledge graphs by mapping entity-relation fact triples to both Euclidean space and complex frequency domain. The CPA-MSKG model combines embeddings from real-number space and complex frequency domain, which not only enhances the ability to capture the complexity of entities and relationships but also demonstrates significant advantages when handling different types of relationships. Through an in-depth investigation of the role of Fourier transform in the model, this study reveals the potential of this transformation in capturing implicit features and improving the efficiency of feature learning. Experimental results indicate that CP A-MSKG performs exceptionally well in head and tail entity prediction tasks, especially when dealing with complex relationships, where the fluctuations in prediction results are minimal, indicating high stability. This validates the effectiveness of bilinear mapping in entity relationship prediction and demonstrates the model's robustness in capturing subtle interactions within the knowledge graph, providing a reliable foundation for various knowledge-based applications.",

By constructing a unified embedding space for biomedical concepts and a wide range of common SNPs from sources such as patient-level data, biomedical knowledge graphs, and GWAS summaries, GENEREL aligns the embeddings of SNPs and clinical concepts through multi-task contrastive learning. This allows the model to adapt to diverse natural language representations of biomedical concepts while bypassing the limitations of traditional code mapping systems across different data sources. Our experiments demonstrate GENEREL's ability to effectively capture the nuanced relationships between SNPs and clinical concepts. GENEREL also emerges to discern the degree of relatedness, potentially allowing for a more refined identification of concepts. This pioneering approach in constructing a unified embedding system for both SNPs and biomedical concepts enhances the potential for data integration and discovery in biomedical research.",

While entity alignment (EA) between KGs has drawn increasing attention from the research community, EA between TKGs and OKGs still remains unexplored. In this work, we propose a novel Temporal Relational Entity Alignment method (TREA) which is able to learn alignment-oriented TKG embeddings and represent new emerging entities. We first map entities, relations and timestamps into an embedding space, and the initial feature of each entity is represented by fusing the embeddings of its connected relations and timestamps as well as its neighboring entities. A graph neural network (GNN) is employed to capture intra-graph information and a temporal relational attention mechanism is utilized to integrate relation and time features of links between nodes. Finally, a margin-based full multi-class log-loss is used for efficient training and a sequential time regularizer is used to model unobserved timestamps. We use three well-established TKG datasets, as references for evaluating temporal and non-temporal EA methods. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art EA methods.",

To fill this gap, this paper introduces RouteKG, a novel Knowledge Graph-based framework for route prediction. Specifically, we construct a Knowledge Graph on the road network to encode spatial relations, especially moving directions that are crucial for human navigation. Moreover, an n-ary tree-based algorithm is introduced to efficiently generate top-K routes in a batch mode, enhancing computational efficiency. To further optimize the prediction performance, a rank refinement module is incorporated to fine-tune the candidate route rankings. The model performance is evaluated using two real-world vehicle trajectory datasets from two Chinese cities under various practical scenarios. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy over baseline methods. We further validate the proposed method by utilizing the pre-trained model as a simulator for real-time traffic flow estimation at the link level. RouteKG holds great potential for transforming vehicle navigation, traffic management, and a variety of intelligent transportation tasks, playing a crucial role in advancing the core foundation of intelligent and connected urban systems.",

      "abstract": "People consume items not only by themselves but also in groups that include their family, friends, coworkers, and online social groups. Different from individual recommendation systems, group recommendation systems first consider group member’s preference separately. The impacts among members are considered, and then, the final group preference and decision would be generated. However, existing group recommendation models suffer severer data sparsity problems than traditional recommendation systems. There is currently lack of a systematic approach to properly address the above issue. What is worse, previous works less consider situations that users may have diverse interests, which means that users may change their preferences by considering the preferences of other group members. Here, we propose a member-augmented multi-interest model with knowledge graph (KG) embeddings to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks. Because only positive labels of groups can be identified in a dataset, precisely predicting a group’s opinion on items that members have not been exposed to is difficult. Accordingly, our model applies the member augmentation (MA) technique to precisely predict a group’s opinion on items. In addition, we leverage multi-interest framework to model the change of diverse user preferences. The framework can know which interests of the user will affect the decision of the group, and interests will vary with different group members.

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph completion aims to predict missing relations between entities in a knowledge graph. One of the effective ways for knowledge graph completion is knowledge graph embedding. However, existing embedding methods usually focus on developing deeper and more complex neural networks, or leveraging additional information, which inevitably increases computational complexity and is unfriendly to real-time applications. In this article, we propose an effective BERT-enhanced shallow neural network model for knowledge graph completion named ShallowBKGC. Specifically, given an entity pair, we first apply the pre-trained language model BERT to extract text features of head and tail entities. At the same time, we use the embedding layer to extract structure features of head and tail entities. Then the text and structure features are integrated into one entity-pair representation via average operation followed by a non-linear transformation. Finally, based on the entity-pair representation, we calculate probability of each relation through multi-label modeling to predict relations for the given entity pair. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our model achieves a superior performance in comparison with baseline methods.

      "abstract": "Ontologies play a central role in structuring knowledge across domains, supporting tasks such as reasoning, data integration, and semantic search. However, their large size and complexity, particularly in fields such as biomedicine, computational biology, law, and engineering, make them difficult for non-experts to navigate. Formal query languages such as SPARQL offer expressive access but require users to understand the ontology's structure and syntax. In contrast, visual exploration tools and basic keyword-based search interfaces are easier to use but often lack flexibility and expressiveness. We introduce FuzzyVis, a proof-of-concept system that enables intuitive and expressive exploration of complex ontologies. FuzzyVis integrates two key components: a fuzzy logic-based querying model built on fuzzy ontology embeddings, and an interactive visual interface for building and interpreting queries. Users can construct new composite concepts by selecting and combining existing ontology concepts using logical operators such as conjunction, disjunction, and negation. These composite concepts are matched against the ontology using fuzzy membership-based embeddings, which capture degrees of membership and support approximate, concept-level similarity search. The visual interface supports browsing, query composition, and partial search without requiring formal syntax. By combining fuzzy semantics with embedding-based reasoning, FuzzyVis enables flexible interpretation, efficient computation, and exploratory learning. Case studies demonstrate how FuzzyVis supports subtle information needs and helps users uncover relevant concepts in large, complex ontologies.",

      "abstract": "Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) capture the dynamic nature of real-world facts by incorporating temporal dimensions that reflect their evolving states. These variations add complexity to the task of knowledge graph completion. Introducing temporal granularity can make the representation of facts more precise. In this paper, we propose Learning Temporal Granularity with Quadruplet Networks (LTGQ), which addresses the inherent heterogeneity of TKGs by embedding entities, relations, and timestamps into distinct specialized spaces. This differentiation enables a finer-grained capture of semantic information across the temporal knowledge graph. Specifically, LTGQ incorporates triaffine transformations to model high-order interactions between the elements of quadruples, such as entities, relations, and timestamps, in TKGs. Simultaneously, it leverages Dynamic Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to extract representations of latent spaces across different temporal granularities. By achieving more robust alignment between facts and their respective temporal contexts, LTGQ effectively improves the accuracy of temporal knowledge graph completion. The proposed model was validated on five public datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in TKG completion tasks, thereby confirming the effectiveness of our approach.",

      "abstract": "Recent studies have experimentally shown that we can achieve in non-Euclidean metric space effective and efficient graph embedding, which aims to obtain the vertices' representations reflecting the graph's structure in the metric space. Specifically, graph embedding in hyperbolic space has experimentally succeeded in embedding graphs with hierarchical-tree structure, e.g., data in natural languages, social networks, and knowledge bases. However, recent theoretical analyses have shown a much higher upper bound on non-Euclidean graph embedding's generalization error than Euclidean one's, where a high generalization error indicates that the incompleteness and noise in the data can significantly damage learning performance. It implies that the existing bound cannot guarantee the success of graph embedding in non-Euclidean metric space in a practical training data size, which can prevent non-Euclidean graph embedding's application in real problems. This paper provides a novel upper bound of graph embedding's generalization error by evaluating the local Rademacher complexity of the model as a function set of the distances of representation couples. Our bound clarifies that the performance of graph embedding in non-Euclidean metric space, including hyperbolic space, is better than the existing upper bounds suggest. Specifically, our new upper bound is polynomial in the metric space's geometric radius $R$ and can be $O(\\frac{1}{S})$ at the fastest, where $S$ is the training data size. Our bound is significantly tighter and faster than the existing one, which can be exponential to $R$ and $O(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{S}})$ at the fastest. Specific calculations on example cases show that graph embedding in non-Euclidean metric space can outperform that in Euclidean space with much smaller training data than the existing bound has suggested.",

      "abstract": "Islands with both land and sea characteristics provide the foundation for protecting the marine environment, preserving the ecological balance of the ocean, and fostering sustainable economic and social growth. Advanced monitoring technologies have boosted the collection of multi-source data of islands, but the isolation and insufficiency of data are harmful to the development and management of islands. To form a coherent and complete understanding of islands, it is necessary to convert the multi-source data into knowledge-based information. This paper proposes an island knowledge graph construction method based on the combination of entity dictionary and rule patterns, and builds the island knowledge graph (ISLKG) from the top to bottom. An ontology layer is initially created to standardize island knowledge, followed by the collection, transformation, and extraction of entities and relationships from multi-source data in order to construct an island knowledge graph. Then, a knowledge reasoning model based on knowledge graph embedding is used for knowledge completion, improving the ISLKG. Finally, the knowledge inference model was verified based on the constructed island knowledge graph. The results indicate that the model can effectively predict missing entities and complement the island knowledge graph.",

      "abstract": "In the era of digital information, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of information is crucial, making fact-checking a vital process. Currently, English fact-checking has thrived due to various language processing tools and ample datasets. However, the same cannot be said for Vietnamese fact-checking, which faces significant challenges due to the lack of such resources. To address these challenges, we propose a model for checking Vietnamese facts by synthesizing three popular technologies: Knowledge Graph (KG), Datalog, and KG-BERT. The KG serves as the foundation for the fact-checking process, containing a dataset of Vietnamese information. Datalog, a logical programming language, is used with inference rules to complete the knowledge within the Vietnamese KG. KG-BERT, a Deep Learning (DL) model, is then trained on this KG to rapidly and accurately classify information that needs fact-checking. Furthermore, to put Vietnamese complex sentences into the fact-checking model, we present a solution for extracting triples from these sentences. This approach also contributes significantly to the ease of constructing foundational datasets for the Vietnamese KG. To evaluate the model's performance, we create a Vietnamese dataset comprising 130,190 samples to populate the KG. Using Datalog, we enrich this graph with additional knowledge. The KG is then utilized to train the KG-BERT model, achieving an impressive accuracy of 95%. Our proposed solution shows great promise for fact-checking Vietnamese information and has the potential to contribute to the development of fact-checking tools and techniques for other languages. Overall, this research makes a significant contribution to the field of data science by providing an accurate solution for fact-checking information in Vietnamese language contexts.",

      "abstract": "Inductive link prediction (ILP) is to predict links for unseen entities in emerging knowledge graphs (KGs), considering the evolving nature of KGs. A more challenging scenario is that emerging KGs consist of only unseen entities without any edge connected to original KGs, called as disconnected emerging KGs (DEKGs). Existing studies for DEKGs only focus on predicting enclosing links, i.e., predicting links inside the emerging KG. The bridging links, which carry the evolutionary information from the original KG to DEKG, have not been investigated by previous work so far. To fill in the gap, we propose a novel model entitled DEKG-ILP (Disconnected Emerging Knowledge Graph Oriented Inductive Link Prediction) that consists of the following two components. (1) The module CLRM (Contrastive Learning-based Relation-specific Feature Modeling) is developed to extract global relation-based semantic features that are shared between original KGs and DEKGs with a novel sampling strategy. (2) The module GSM (GNN-based Subgraph Modeling) is proposed to extract the local subgraph topological information around each link in KGs. The extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DEKG-ILP has obvious performance improvements compared with state-of-the-art methods for both enclosing and bridging link prediction.",

We compare academic- and company-authored AI publications published in the last decade and use scientometric data from multiple scholarly databases to look for differences across these groups and to disclose the top contributing organizations. While the vast majority of publications is still produced by academia, we find that the citation count an individual publication receives is significantly higher when it is (co–)authored by a company. Furthermore, using a variety of altmetric indicators, we notice that publications with company participation receive considerably more attention online. Finally, we place our analysis results in a broader context and present targeted recommendations to safeguard a harmonious balance between academia and industry in the realm of AI research.",

State-of-the-art methods for this task use pre-trained language models (LMs) via fine-tuning, yet fine-tuning is computationally expensive and cannot adapt to new relation types or new LMs. As a remedy, we leverage the generalization capabilities of pre-trained LMs and present a novel framework for document-level in-context few-shot relation extraction. Our framework has three strengths: it eliminates the need (1) for named entity recognition and (2) for human annotations of documents, and (3) it can be updated to new LMs without re-training. We evaluate our framework using DocRED, the largest publicly available dataset for document-level relation extraction, and demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance. We further show that our framework actually performs much better than the original labels from the development set of DocRED. Finally, we conduct an extensive benchmark demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework, achieving state-of-the-art results across six relation extraction datasets and outperforming more than 30 baseline methods. Unlike our framework, the baseline methods have large computational overhead (e.g., from fine-tuning). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to reformulate the document-level relation extraction task as a tailored in-context few-shot learning paradigm.",

Typically, existing methods solely learn entity embeddings from their respective neighborhoods, resulting in inadequately differentiated entity pair representations. And they only use the updated entities to represent the relations, which leads to relation overfitting. To address the issues, we propose a FKGC model based on hierarchical neighborhood information interaction (HNII). Specifically, the model first considers the interaction between head and tail entities. It obtains enhanced entity embedding representations from the task-relation-level and entity-pair-level by using a hierarchical neighborhood entity encoder. Then, a bi-directional LSTM relation encoder is introduced to output the relation embedding representations. Finally, an attention mixed matching processor is used to compute the semantic similarity. This is conducive to fully exploring the deep semantic information of entities and relations. Extensive related experiments on two public datasets show that HNII performs excellent in the task of FKGC.",

      "abstract": "Recent work on knowledge graph completion (KGC) focuses on acquiring embeddings of entities and relations in knowledge graphs. These embedding methods necessitate that all test entities be present during the training phase, resulting in a time-consuming retraining process for out-of-knowledge-graph (OOKG) entities. To tackle this predicament, current inductive methods employ graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent unseen entities by aggregating information of the known neighbors, and enhance the performance with additional information, such as attention mechanisms or logic rules. Nonetheless, Two key challenges continue to persist: (i) identifying inter-rule correlations to further facilitate the inference process, and (ii) capturing interactions among rule mining, rule inference, and embedding to enhance both rule and embedding learning. In this paper, we propose a virtual neighbor network with inter-rule correlations (VNC) to address the above challenges. VNC consists of three main components: (i) rule mining, (ii) rule inference, and (iii) embedding. To identify useful complex patterns in knowledge graphs, both logic rules and inter-rule correlations are extracted from knowledge graphs based on operations over relation embeddings. To reduce data sparsity, virtual networks for OOKG entities are predicted and assigned soft labels by optimizing a rule-constrained problem. We also devise an iterative framework to capture the underlying interactions between rule and embedding learning. Experimental results on both link prediction and triple classification tasks show that the proposed VNC framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on four widely-used knowledge graphs.",

Researchers have continuously explored various models. However, most previous efforts have neglected to take advantage of regularization from a deeper perspective and therefore have not been used to their full potential. This paper rethinks the application of regularization methods in KGC. Through extensive empirical studies on various KGC models, we find that carefully designed regularization not only alleviates overfitting and reduces variance but also enables these models to break through the upper bounds of their original performance. Furthermore, we introduce a novel sparse-regularization method that embeds the concept of rank-based selective sparsity into the KGC regularizer. The core idea is to selectively penalize those components with significant features in the embedding vector, thus effectively ignoring many components that contribute little and may only represent noise. Various comparative experiments on multiple datasets and multiple models show that the SPR regularization method is better than other regularization methods and can enable the KGC model to further break through the performance margin.",

Existing models of inductive reasoning mainly focus on predicting missing links by learning logical rules. However, many existing approaches do not take into account semantic correlations between relations, which are commonly seen in real-world knowledge graphs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel inductive reasoning approach, namely TACT, which can effectively exploit Topology-Aware CorrelaTions between relations in an entity-independent manner. TACT is inspired by the observation that the semantic correlation between two relations is highly correlated to their topological structure in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we categorize all relation pairs into several topological patterns, and then propose a Relational Correlation Network (RCN) to learn the importance of the different patterns for inductive link prediction. Experiments demonstrate that TACT can effectively model semantic correlations between relations, and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets for the inductive link prediction task.",

      "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graph completion aims to infer the missing facts in temporal knowledge graphs. Current approaches usually embed factual knowledge into continuous vector space and apply geometric operations to learn potential patterns in temporal knowledge graphs. However, these methods only adopt a single operation, which may have limitations in capturing the complex temporal dynamics present in temporal knowledge graphs. Therefore, we propose a simple but effective method, i.e. TCompoundE, which is specially designed with two geometric operations, including time-specific and relation-specific operations. We provide mathematical proofs to demonstrate the ability of TCompoundE to encode various relation patterns. Experimental results show that our proposed model significantly outperforms existing temporal knowledge graph embedding models. Our code is available at https://github.com/nk-ruiying/TCompoundE.",

      "abstract": "As the generalizations of traditional DNNs to graphs, GNNs inherit both advantages and disadvantages of traditional DNNs. Like traditional DNNs, GNNs have been shown to be effective in many graph-related tasks such as nodefocused and graph-focused tasks. Traditional DNNs have been demonstrated to be vulnerable to dedicated designed adversarial attacks (Goodfellow et al., 2014b; Xu et al., 2019b). Under adversarial attacks, the victimized samples are perturbed in such a way that they are not easily noticeable, but they can lead to wrong results. It is increasingly evident that GNNs also inherit this drawback. The adversary can generate graph adversarial perturbations by manipulating the graph structure or node features to fool the GNN models. This limitation of GNNs has arisen immense concerns on adopting them in safety-critical applications such as financial systems and risk management. For example, in a credit scoring system, fraudsters can fake connections with several high-credit customers to evade the fraudster detection models; and spammers can easily create fake followers to increase the chance of fake news being recommended and spread. Therefore, we have witnessed more and more research attention to graph adversarial attacks and their countermeasures. In this chapter, we first introduce concepts and definitions of graph adversarial attacks and detail some representative adversarial attack methods on graphs. Then, we discuss representative defense techniques against these adversarial attacks.",

      "abstract": "Temporal Knowledge Graph Embedding (TKGE) is a crucial technique for performing Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion (TKGC). The effectiveness of TKGE largely depends on the ability to model intrinsic relation patterns. However, as we know, most existing TKGE models usually embed KGs into a single geometric space such as Euclidean, hyperbolic or hyperspherical space to maintain their specific geometric structures (e.g., chain, hierarchy, and ring structures). None of the existing methods can simultaneously model relation patterns of chain, hierarchy, ring structures, and relation mapping properties. This paper constructs a hybrid interaction TKGE model HyIE, which learns spatial structures interactively between the Euclidean, hyperbolic and hyperspherical spaces. HyIE performs two Householder transformations of head and tail entities parameterized by relations in a high-dimensional mixed vector space. The curvature of hyperbolic and hyperspherical spaces depends on the product of both relation and temporal. The core of HyIE lies in implementing transformations and interactions of vectors in Euclidean, hyperbolic and hyperspherical spaces, and Household transformation of head and tail entities. Theoretically, HyIE can model crucial relation patterns and mapping properties simultaneously. Experimental results on five temporal knowledge graph benchmarks show that our HyIE achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

      "abstract": "Relation prediction in knowledge graphs (KGs) aims at predicting missing relations in incomplete triples, whereas the dominant paradigm by KG embeddings has a limitation to predict the relation between unseen entities. This situation is called an inductive setting, which is more common in the real-world scenario. To handle this issue, implicit symbolic rules have shown great potential in capturing the inductive capability. However, it is still challenging to obtain precise representations of logic rules from KGs. The argument variability and predicate non-commutativity in symbolic rule integration make the modeling of component symbols difficult. To this end, we propose a novel inductive relation prediction model named SymRITa with a logic transformer integrating rules. SymRITa firstly extracts the subgraph, whose embeddings are captured by a graph network. Meanwhile, symbolic rule graphs in the subgraph can be generated. Then, the symbolic rules are modeled by a proposed logic transformer. Specifically, the input format based on the subgraph-based embeddings is to focus on the argument variability in symbolic rules. In addition, a conjunction attention mechanism in the logic transformer can resolve predicate non-commutativity in the symbolic rule integration process. Finally, the subgraph-based and symbol-based embeddings obtained from the previous steps are combined for the training regime, and prediction results as well as rules explaining the reasoning process are explicitly output. Extensive experiments on twelve inductive datasets show that SymRITa achieves outstanding effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art inductive baselines. Moreover, the logic rules with corresponding confidences provide an interpretable paradigm.",

      "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graphs, representing the dynamic relationships and interactions between entities over time, have been identified as a promising approach for event forecasting. However, a limitation of most temporal knowledge graph reasoning methods is their heavy reliance on the recurrence or periodicity of events, which brings challenges to inferring future events related to entities that lack historical interaction. In fact, the current state of affairs is often the result of a combination of historical information and underlying factors that are not directly observable. To this end, we investigate the limits of historical information for temporal knowledge graph extrapolation and propose a new event forecasting model called Contrastive Event Network (CENET) based on a novel training framework of historical contrastive learning. CENET learns both the historical and non-historical dependency to distinguish the most potential entities that best match the given query. Simultaneously, by launching contrastive learning, it trains representations of queries to probe whether the current moment is more dependent on historical or non-historical events. These representations further help train a binary classifier, whose output is a boolean mask, indicating the related entities in the search space. During the inference process, CENET employs a mask-based strategy to generate the final results. We evaluate our proposed model on five benchmark graphs. The results demonstrate that CENET significantly outperforms all existing methods in most metrics, achieving at least 8.3% relative improvement of Hits@1 over previous state-of-the-art baselines on event-based datasets.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Advertising click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a fundamental task in recommender systems, aimed at estimating the likelihood of users interacting with advertisements based on their historical behavior. This prediction process has evolved through two main stages: from traditional shallow interaction models to more advanced deep learning approaches. Shallow models typically operate at the level of individual features, failing to fully leverage the rich, multilevel information available across different feature sets, leading to less accurate predictions. In contrast, deep learning models exhibit superior feature representation and learning capabilities, enabling a more realistic simulation of user interactions and improving the accuracy of CTR prediction. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of CTR prediction algorithms in the context of recommender systems. The algorithms are categorized into two groups: shallow interactive models and deep learning-based prediction models, including deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and graph neural networks. Additionally, this paper also discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the aforementioned algorithms, as well as the benchmark datasets and model evaluation methods used for CTR prediction. Finally, it identifies potential future research directions in this rapidly advancing field.",

      "abstract": "In practical applications, the temporal completeness of knowledge graphs is of great importance. However, previous studies have mostly focused on static knowledge graphs, generally neglecting the dynamic evolutionary properties of facts. Moreover, the unpredictable and limited availability of temporal knowledge graphs, together with the complex temporal dependency patterns, make current models inadequate for effectively describing facts that experience temporal transitions. To better represent the evolution of things over time, we provide a learning technique that uses quaternion rotation to describe temporal knowledge graphs. This technique describes the evolution of entities as a temporal rotation change in quaternion space. Compared to the Ermitian inner product in complex number space, the Hamiltonian product in quaternion space is better at showing how things might be connected. This leads to a learning process that is both more effective and more articulate. Experimental results demonstrate that our learning method significantly outperforms existing methods in capturing the dynamic evolution of temporal knowledge graphs, with improved accuracy and robustness across a range of benchmark datasets.",

      "abstract": "The construction of medical knowledge graphs (MKGs) is steadily progressing from manual to automatic methods, which inevitably introduce noise, which could impair the performance of downstream healthcare applications. Existing error detection approaches depend on the topological structure and external labels of entities in MKGs to improve their quality. Nevertheless, due to the cost of manual annotation and imperfect automatic algorithms, precise entity labels in MKGs cannot be readily obtained. To address these issues, we propose an approach named Enhancing error detection on Medical knowledge graphs via intrinsic labEL (EMKGEL). Considering the absence of hyper-view KG, we establish a hyper-view KG and a triplet-level KG for implicit label information and neighborhood information, respectively. Inspired by the success of graph attention networks (GATs), we introduce the hyper-view GAT to incorporate label messages and neighborhood information into representation learning. We leverage a confidence score that combines local and global trustworthiness to estimate the triplets. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted experiments on three publicly available MKGs, namely PharmKG-8k, DiseaseKG, and DiaKG. Compared with the baseline models, the Precision@K value improved by 0.7%, 6.1%, and 3.6%, respectively, on these datasets. Furthermore, our method empirically showed that it significantly outperformed the baseline on a general knowledge graph, Nell-995.",

Therefore, we propose a solution that calculates the Horn rule constraint among relations, obtained through iterative optimization learning with labeled triplets, objective score functions, and relation modeling. This method enables us to achieve better regulation of rule-based effects, merely enforcing relation representations to satisfy constraints introduced by Horn rules.

A central challenge lies in creating an intelligent system capable of autonomously executing the full inorganic materials discovery cycle, from ideation and planning to experimentation and iterative refinement. We introduce SparksMatter, a multi-agent AI model for automated inorganic materials design that addresses user queries by generating ideas, designing and executing experimental workflows, continuously evaluating and refining results, and ultimately proposing candidate materials that meet the target objectives. SparksMatter also critiques and improves its own responses, identifies research gaps and limitations, and suggests rigorous follow-up validation steps, including DFT calculations and experimental synthesis and characterization, embedded in a well-structured final report. The model's performance is evaluated across case studies in thermoelectrics, semiconductors, and perovskite oxides materials design. The results demonstrate the capacity of SparksMatter to generate novel stable inorganic structures that target the user's needs. Benchmarking against frontier models reveals that SparksMatter consistently achieves higher scores in relevance, novelty, and scientific rigor, with a significant improvement in novelty across multiple real-world design tasks as assessed by a blinded evaluator. These results demonstrate SparksMatter's unique capacity to generate chemically valid, physically meaningful, and creative inorganic materials hypotheses beyond existing materials knowledge.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph completion demands effective modeling of multifaceted semantic relationships between entities. Yet, prevailing methods, which rely on static scoring functions over learned embeddings, struggling to simultaneously capture rich semantic context and the dynamic nature of relations. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Flow-Modulated Scoring (FMS) framework, conceptualizing a relation as a dynamic evolutionary process governed by its static semantic environment. FMS operates in two stages: it first learns context-aware entity embeddings via a Semantic Context Learning module, and then models a dynamic flow between them using a Conditional Flow-Matching module. This learned flow dynamically modulates a base static score for the entity pair. By unifying context-rich static representations with a conditioned dynamic flow, FMS achieves a more comprehensive understanding of relational semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FMS establishes a new state of the art across both canonical knowledge graph completion tasks: relation prediction and entity prediction. On the standard relation prediction benchmark FB15k-237, FMS achieves a near-perfect MRR of 99.8\\% and Hits@1 of 99.7\\% using a mere 0.35M parameters, while also attaining a 99.9\\% MRR on WN18RR. Its dominance extends to entity prediction, where it secures a 25.2\\% relative MRR gain in the transductive setting and substantially outperforms all baselines in challenging inductive settings. By unifying a dynamic flow mechanism with rich static contexts, FMS offers a highly effective and parameter-efficient new paradigm for knowledge graph completion.

Temporal Knowledge Graph Embedding (TKGE) techniques complement TKGs and predict links within them. The efficacy of TKGE hinges upon its capability to effectively model intrinsic temporal relation patterns. However, existing methodologies often need to capture temporal relation patterns adequately or establish intrinsic connections between evolving relations. We propose a highly robust TKGE framework called HouRP to address this limitation and incorporate a more comprehensive range of relational information. This framework introduces two types of Householder transformations into TKGE. Specifically, the Householder projections enable the generation of temporal-specific representations for each entity. At the same time, the relational Householder rotations facilitate high-dimensional rotations between projected entities, thereby capturing relation-specific properties. Our proposed model’s effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experimentation on four widely used TKGs datasets.",

Our experimental evaluations illustrate dramatic enhancements over conventional models, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets with notable increments: 4.30%/4.79% on ICEWS-14, 11.70%/11.48% on ICEWS-05-15, 21.50%/31.20% on YAGO15k, and 26.90%/66.09% on GDELT in term of absolute/relative performance gains on mean reciprocal rank (MMR).",

      "abstract": "Existing recommendation methods often struggle to model users' multifaceted preferences due to the diversity and volatility of user behavior, as well as the inherent uncertainty and ambiguity of item attributes in practical scenarios. Multi-interest recommendation addresses this challenge by extracting multiple interest representations from users' historical interactions, enabling fine-grained preference modeling and more accurate recommendations. It has drawn broad interest in recommendation research. However, current recommendation surveys have either specialized in frontier recommendation methods or delved into specific tasks and downstream applications. In this work, we systematically review the progress, solutions, challenges, and future directions of multi-interest recommendation by answering the following three questions: (1) Why is multi-interest modeling significantly important for recommendation? (2) What aspects are focused on by multi-interest modeling in recommendation? and (3) How can multi-interest modeling be applied, along with the technical details of the representative modules? We hope that this survey establishes a fundamental framework and delivers a preliminary overview for researchers interested in this field and committed to further exploration. The implementation of multi-interest recommendation summarized in this survey is maintained at https://github.com/WHUIR/Multi-Interest-Recommendation-A-Survey.",

      "abstract": "Existing formats based on the simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) encoding and molecular graph structure are designed to encode the complete semantic and structural information of molecules. However, the physicochemical properties of molecules are complex, and a single encoding of molecular features from SMILES sequences or molecular graph structures cannot adequately represent molecular information. Aiming to address this problem, this study proposes a sequence graph cross-attention (SG-ATT) representation architecture for a molecular property prediction model to efficiently use domain knowledge to enhance molecular graph feature encoding and combine the features of molecular SMILES sequences. The SG-ATT fuses the two-dimensional molecular features so that the current model input molecular information contains molecular structure information and semantic information. The SG-ATT was tested on nine molecular property prediction tasks. Among them, the biggest SG-ATT model performance improvement was 4.5% on the BACE dataset, and the average model performance improvement was 1.83% on the full dataset. Additionally, specific model interpretability studies were conducted to showcase the performance of the SG-ATT model on different datasets. In-depth analysis was provided through case studies of in vitro validation. Finally, network tools for molecular property prediction were developed for the use of researchers.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs), which store an extensive number of relational facts (head, relation, tail), serve various applications. While many downstream tasks highly rely on the expressive modeling and predictive embedding of KGs, most of the current KG representation learning methods, where each entity is embedded as a vector in the Euclidean space and each relation is embedded as a transformation, follow an entity ranking protocol. On one hand, such an embedding design cannot capture many-to-many relations. On the other hand, in many retrieval cases, the users wish to get an exact set of answers without any ranking, especially when the results are expected to be precise, e.g., which genes cause an illness. Such scenarios are commonly referred to as \"set retrieval\". This work presents a pioneering study on the KG set retrieval problem. We show that the set retrieval highly depends on expressive modeling of many-to-many relations, and propose a new KG embedding model SpherE to address this problem. SpherE is based on rotational embedding methods, but each entity is embedded as a sphere instead of a vector. While inheriting the high interpretability of rotational-based models, our SpherE can more expressively model one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many relations. Through extensive experiments, we show that our SpherE can well address the set retrieval problem while still having a good predictive ability to infer missing facts.

      "abstract": "Few-shot knowledge graph completion (FKGC) addresses the long-tail problem of relations by leveraging a few observed support entity pairs to infer unknown facts for tail-located relations. Learning the relation representation of entity pairs and evaluating the match of query and support entity pairs are the two key steps of FKGC. Existing methods learn the representation of entity pairs by either aggregating neighbors of entities or integrating relation representations in the connected paths from head to tail. However, in few-shot scenarios, the limited number of support entity pairs and insufficient structural information with a single neighborhood topology will lead to matching failure. To this end, we consider the star and ring topological information for a given entity pair: (1) Entity neighborhood, which captures multi-hop neighbors of entities; (2) Relational path, which characterizes compound relation forms. Furthermore, to effectively fuse the two kinds of heterogeneous topological information, we design the multi-aggregator and the fine-grained path correlation matching algorithm to obtain more delicate and balanced matching. Based on the proposed relational path correlation matching module, we propose the relation adaptive network to solve the few-shot temporal knowledge graph completion problem. The experimental results show that our method continuously outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "With the increasing number of network security threats and the frequent occurrence of software vulnerability attacks, the effective management and large-scale retrieval of vulnerability data have become urgent needs. Existing vulnerability information is scattered across heterogeneous sources and is difficult to integrate, which in turn makes it hard for security analysts to quickly retrieve and analyze relevant security knowledge. To address this problem, this paper proposes a method to construct a vulnerability knowledge graph by integrating multi-source vulnerability data, combining graph embedding technology with large language model reasoning to aggregate, infer, and enrich vulnerability knowledge. Experiments demonstrated that our domain-tuned Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory–Conditional Random Field (BiLSTM-CRF) named entity recognition (NER), enhanced with a cybersecurity dictionary, achieved a 90.1% F1-score for entity extraction. For link prediction, a hybrid Graph Attention Network fused with GPT-3 reasoning boosted Hits1 by 0.137, Hits3 by 0.116, and Hits10 by 0.101 over the baseline. These results confirm that our approach markedly enhanced entity identification and relationship inference, yielding a more complete and dynamically updatable cybersecurity knowledge graph.",

Then, combining heterogeneous networks and social network environments, used data information and network structure to establish a similarity matrix for users, and used the similarity matrix to determine whether they point to the same user, optimized and derived the objective function based on matrix theory, added regularization terms to avoid too much difference between the alignment matrix and the prior alignment matrix, and solving it. Once again, based on the user alignment concept mentioned above, a privacy intersection protocol based on fully homomorphic encryption and hash algorithm was proposed in a privacy environment, which used fully homomorphic encryption and hash algorithm to encrypt data to ensure security. Finally, in order to design a multi-party privacy intersection protocol that adapts to multi-party interactions, Freedman based two-party/multi-party intersection protocols had been proposed, and the multi-party secure intersection protocol was tested, with an average accuracy of 90.3%. User alignment and privacy intersection are prerequisites for personalized computing, and also provide a theoretical basis for the development of Vertical Federated Learning and privacy computing.",

      "abstract": "Aiming to accurately predict missing edges representing relations between entities, which are pervasive in real-world Knowledge Graphs (KGs), relation prediction plays a critical role in enhancing the comprehensiveness and utility of KGs. Recent research focuses on path-based methods due to their inductive and explainable properties. However, these methods face a great challenge when lots of reasoning paths do not form Closed Paths (CPs) in the KG. To address this challenge, we propose Anchoring Path Sentence Transformer (APST) by introducing Anchoring Paths (APs) to alleviate the reliance of CPs. Specifically, we develop a search-based description retrieval method to enrich entity descriptions and an assessment mechanism to evaluate the rationality of APs. APST takes both APs and CPs as the inputs of a unified Sentence Transformer architecture, enabling comprehensive predictions and high-quality explanations. We evaluate APST on three public datasets and achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in 30 of 36 transductive, inductive, and few-shot experimental settings.",

Recently, researchers proposed many deep learning-based methods in the area of NRL.

      "abstract": "Knowledge-graph-based recommendation aims to provide personalized recommendation services to users based on their historical interaction information, which is of great significance for shopping transaction rates and other aspects. With the rapid growth of online shopping, the knowledge graph constructed from users’ historical interaction data now incorporates multiattribute information, including timestamps, images, and textual content. The information of multiple modalities is difficult to effectively utilize due to their different representation structures and spaces. The existing methods attempt to utilize the above information through simple embedding representation and aggregation, but ignore targeted representation learning for information with different attributes and learning effective weights for aggregation. In addition, existing methods are not sufficient for effectively modeling temporal information. In this article, we propose MTR, a knowledge graph recommendation framework based on mixture of experts network. To achieve this goal, we use a mixture-of-experts network to learn targeted representations and weights of different product attributes for effective modeling and utilization. In addition, we effectively model the temporal information during the user shopping process. A thorough experimental study on popular benchmarks validates that MTR can achieve competitive results.",

Recently, with rapid development of information gathering and extraction technology, the sources of data become more extensive and multi-view data attracts growing attention. Consequently, attributed graphs can be divided into two categories: single-view attributed graphs and multi-view attributed graphs. Compared with single-view attributed graphs, multi-view attributed graphs can provide more complementary information but also pose challenges to fusing information of multi-views. Moreover, attributed graph clustering aims to reveal the inherent community structure of the graph, which is widely applied in fraud detection, crime recognition, and recommendation systems. Recently, numerous methods based on various ideas and techniques have appeared to cluster attributed graphs, thus there is an urgent need to summarize related methods. To this end, we make a timely and comprehensive review of recent methods. Furthermore, we provide a novel standard according to fusion results to classify related methods into three categories: fusion on adjacency matrix methods, fusion on embedding methods, and model-based methods. Moreover, to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of existing methods, this article evaluates these advanced methods with sufficient experimental results and theoretical analysis.

      "abstract": "Learning representations for temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) is a fundamental task. Most existing methods regard TKG as a sequence of static snapshots and recurrently learn representations by retracing the previous snapshots. However, new knowledge can be continuously accrued to TKGs as streams. These methods either cannot handle new entities or fail to update representations in real time, making them unfeasible to adapt to the streaming scenarios. In this paper, we propose a lightweight framework called StreamE towards the efficient generation of TKG representations in streaming scenarios. To reduce the parameter size, entity representations in StreamE are decoupled from the model training to serve as the memory module to store the historical information of entities. To achieve efficient update and generation, the process of generating representations is decoupled as two functions in StreamE. An update function is learned to incrementally update entity representations based on the newly-arrived knowledge and a read function is learned to predict the future semantics of entity representations. The update function avoids the recurrent modeling paradigm and thus gains high efficiency while the read function considers multiple semantic change properties. We further propose a joint training strategy with two temporal regularizations to effectively optimize the framework. Experimental results show that StreamE can achieve better performance than baseline methods with 100x faster in inference, 25x faster in training, and only 1/5 parameter size, which demonstrates its superiority.

      "abstract": "With the advancement of resilient city construction and urban renewal initiatives, the progress of underground utility tunnels has emerged as a significant trend in urban infrastructure. These tunnels play a crucial role in enhancing the comprehensive load-bearing capacity of underground pipelines while optimizing both above-ground and subterranean urban space. Given the concentration of various municipal pipelines such as water, electricity, gas and heat-alongside numerous ancillary facilities, the systems within these utility tunnels are extensive and intricate, with numerous safety-related factors. In the event of a disaster, these factors can easily trigger a complex cascade of events. A bidirectional analysis of the evolution and causes of incidents within these tunnels not only aids in pre-emptively mitigating potential risks but also facilitates effective post-incident tracing and management. Current evaluation models, including classification statistics and qualitative-quantitative analysis, offer some theoretical support but often emphasize unidirectional analysis, which fails to capture the full complexity and variability of such incidents. To address this limitation, this paper proposes an innovative evaluation approach that integrates Bayesian network and fault tree analysis. By applying boolean operations on the fault tree, this method thoroughly investigates the root causes of accidents, while the Bayesian network model quantitatively assesses the likelihood of primary accidents and secondary derivative disasters within underground utility tunnels. This approach enables a comprehensive and bidirectional analysis of tunnel accidents, offering a novel perspective and methodology for risk assessment, thereby supporting the safe and stable operation of these critical urban infrastructures.",

Finally, we differentiate CoDEx from the popular FB15K-237 knowledge graph completion dataset by showing that CoDEx covers more diverse and interpretable content, and is a more difficult link prediction benchmark.

      "abstract": "In recent years, the KG (Knowledge graph), as a new generation of knowledge engineering technical representatives, has been developed vigorously. KG is a key step for artificial intelligence to move towards intelligence. Knowledge graph completion (KGC) is a key technology in the construction of KG. The aim is to complement the missing knowledge in the KG. With the development of the Internet, the scale of data increases exponentially, and the scale of KG is increasing day by day. It is very inefficient to make up the missing knowledge based on manual, so many algorithms of KGC have emerged. In this paper, some typical KGC algorithms based on representation learning are summarized and combed, which are mainly divided into tensor decomposition, neural network and translation transformation. The development direction and prospect of KGC in KG are discussed and prospected.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) techniques play a pivotal role in transforming symbolic Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into numerical representations, thereby enhancing various deep learning models for knowledge-augmented applications. Unlike entities, relations in KGs are the carriers of semantic meaning, and their accurate modeling is crucial for the performance of KGE models. Firstly, we address the complex mapping properties inherent in relations, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many mappings. We provide a comprehensive summary of relation-aware mapping-based models, models that utilize specific representation spaces, tensor decomposition-based models, and neural network-based models. Next, focusing on capturing various relation patterns like symmetry, asymmetry, inversion, and composition, we review models that employ modified tensor decomposition, those based on modified relation-aware mappings, and those that leverage rotation operations. Subsequently, considering the implicit hierarchical relations among entities, we introduce models that incorporate auxiliary information, models based on hyperbolic spaces, and those that utilize the polar coordinate system. Finally, in response to more complex scenarios such as sparse and dynamic KGs, this paper discusses potential future research directions. We explore innovative ideas such as integrating multimodal information into KGE, enhancing relation pattern modeling with rules, and developing models to capture relation characteristics in dynamic KGE settings.",

      "abstract": "With the rapid growth of internet data, knowledge graphs (KGs) are considered as efficient form of knowledge representation that captures the semantics of web objects. In recent years, reasoning over KG for various artificial intelligence tasks have received a great deal of research interest. Providing recommendations based on users’ natural language queries is an equally difficult undertaking. In this paper, we propose a novel, context-aware recommender system, based on domain KG, to respond to user-defined natural queries. The proposed recommender system consists of three stages. First, we generate incomplete triples from user queries, which are then segmented using logical conjunction (∧) and disjunction (∨) operations. Then, we generate candidates by utilizing a KGE-based framework (Query2Box) for reasoning over segmented logical triples, with ∧, ∨, and ∃ operators; finally, the generated candidates are re-ranked using neural collaborative filtering (NCF) model by exploiting contextual (auxiliary) information from GraphSAGE embedding. Our approach demonstrates to be simple, yet efficient, at providing explainable recommendations on user’s queries, while leveraging user-item contextual information. Furthermore, our framework has shown to be capable of handling logical complex queries by transforming them into a disjunctive normal form (DNF) of simple queries. In this work, we focus on the restaurant domain as an application domain and use the Yelp dataset to evaluate the system. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed recommender system generalizes well on candidate generation from logical queries and effectively re-ranks those candidates, compared to the matrix factorization model.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we construct an academic literature knowledge graph based on the relationship between documents to facilitate the storage and research of academic literature data. Keywords are an important type of node in the knowledge graph. To solve the problem that there are no keywords in some documents for several reasons in the process of knowledge graph construction, an improved keyword extraction algorithm called TP-CoGlo-TextRank is proposed by using word frequency, position, word co-occurrence frequency, and a word embedding model. By combining the word frequency and position in the document, the importance of words is distinguished. By introducing the GloVe word-embedding model, which brings the external knowledge of documents into the TextRank algorithm, and combining the internal word co-occurrence frequency in the documents, the word-adjacency relationship is transferred non-uniformly. Finally, the words with the highest scores are combined into phrases if they are adjacent in the original text. The validity of the TP-CoGlo-TextRank algorithm is verified by experiments. On this basis, the Neo4j graph database is used to store and display the academic literature knowledge graph, to provide data support for research tasks such as text clustering, automatic summarization, and question-answering systems.",

      "abstract": "Completing missing facts is a fundamental task for temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs). Recently, graph neural network (GNN) based methods, which can simultaneously explore topological and temporal information, have become the state-of-the-art (SOTA) to complete TKGs. However, these studies are based on hand-designed architectures and fail to explore the diverse topological and temporal properties of TKG. To address this issue, we propose to use neural architecture search (NAS) to design data-specific message passing architecture for TKG completion. In particular, we develop a generalized framework to explore topological and temporal information in TKGs. Based on this framework, we design an expressive search space to fully capture various properties of different TKGs. Meanwhile, we adopt a search algorithm, which trains a supernet structure by sampling single path for efficient search with less cost. We further conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets. The results show that the searched architectures by our method achieve the SOTA performances. Besides, the searched models can also implicitly reveal diverse properties in different TKGs. Our code is released in https://github.com/striderdu/SPA.",

      "abstract": "As combination therapy becomes more common in clinical applications, predicting adverse effects of combination medications is a challenging task. However, there are three limitations of the existing prediction models. First, they rely on a single view of the drug and cannot fully utilize multiview information, resulting in limited performance when capturing complex structures. Second, they ignore subgraph information at different scales, which limits the ability to model interactions between subgraphs. Third, there has been limited research on effectively integrating multiview features of molecules. Therefore, we propose ComNet, a deep learning model that improves the accuracy of side effect prediction by integrating multiview features of drugs. First, to capture diverse features of drugs, a multiview feature extraction module is proposed, which not only uses molecular fingerprints but also extracts semantic information on SMILES and spatial information on 3D conformations. Second, to enhance the modeling ability of complex structures, a multiscale subgraph fusion mechanism is proposed, which can fuse local and global graph structures of drugs. Finally, a multiview feature fusion mechanism is proposed, which uses an attention mechanism to adaptively adjust the weights of different views to achieve multiview data fusion. Experiments on several publicly available data sets show that ComNet performs better than existing methods in various complex scenarios, especially in cold-start scenarios. Ablation experiments show that each core structure in ComNet contributes to the overall performance. Further analysis shows that ComNet not only converges rapidly and has good generalization ability but also identifies different substructures in the molecule. Finally, a case study on a self-collected data set validates the superior performance of ComNet in practical applications.",

Recently, aligning temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) that contain time information has aroused increasingly more interest, as the time dimension is widely used in real-life applications. The matching between TKGs requires seed entity pairs, which are lacking in practice. Hence, it is of great significance to study TKG alignment under scarce supervision. In this work, the authors formally formulate the problem of TKG alignment with limited labeled data and propose to solve it under the active learning framework. As the core of active learning is to devise query strategies to select the most informative instances to label, the authors propose to make full use of time information and put forward novel time-aware strategies to meet the requirement of weakly supervised temporal entity alignment. Extensive experimental results on multiple real-world datasets show that it is important to study TKG alignment with scarce supervision, and the proposed time-aware strategy is effective.",

      "abstract": "Representation learning of knowledge graphs (KGs) aims to embed both entities and relations as vectors in a continuous low-dimensional space, which has facilitated various applications such as link prediction and entity retrieval. Most existing KG embedding methods focus on modeling the structured fact triples independently and ignore the multi-type relations among triples as well as the variety of data types (e.g., texts and images) associated with entities in KGs, and thus fail to capture the complex and multi-modal information that is inherently inside the entity-relation triples. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for knowledge graph embedding named Contrastive Multi-modal Graph Neural Network (CMGNN), which can encapsulate comprehensive features from multi-modal content descriptions of entities and high-order connectivity structures. Specifically, CMGNN first learns entity embeddings from multi-modal content and then contrasts encodings from multi-relational local neighbors and high-order connectivities to obtain latent representations of entities and relations simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that CMGNN can effectively model the multi-modalities and multi-type structures in KGs, and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets for the tasks of link prediction and entity classification.",

      "abstract": "Enterprise financial risk analysis aims at predicting the future financial risk of enterprises. Due to its wide and significant application, enterprise financial risk analysis has always been the core research topic in the fields of Finance and Management. Based on advanced computer science and artificial intelligence technologies, enterprise risk analysis research is experiencing rapid developments and making significant progress. Therefore, it is both necessary and challenging to comprehensively review the relevant studies. Although there are already some valuable and impressive surveys on enterprise risk analysis from the perspective of Finance and Management, these surveys introduce approaches in a relatively isolated way and lack recent advances in enterprise financial risk analysis. In contrast, this paper attempts to provide a systematic literature survey of enterprise risk analysis approaches from Big Data perspective, which reviews more than 250 representative articles in the past almost 50 years (from 1968 to 2023). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and only survey work on enterprise financial risk from Big Data perspective. Specifically, this survey connects and systematizes the existing enterprise financial risk studies, i.e. to summarize and interpret the problems, methods, and spotlights in a comprehensive way. In particular, we first introduce the issues of enterprise financial risks in terms of their types,granularity, intelligence, and evaluation metrics, and summarize the corresponding representative works. Then, we compare the analysis methods used to learn enterprise financial risk, and finally summarize the spotlights of the most representative works. Our goal is to clarify current cutting-edge research and its possible future directions to model enterprise risk, aiming to fully understand the mechanisms of enterprise risk generation and contagion.",

      "abstract": "Inductive Link Prediction (ILP) aims to predict links for unseen entities in emerging Knowledge Graphs (KGs), where a more realistic scenario is that unseen entities do not emerge all at once but emerge sequentially in multiple stages. Unfortunately, existing studies neglect the sequential-emerging nature of KGs and simplify this scenario into multi-batch unseen entities emerging simultaneously. Subsequently, two problems arise and restrict the performance of existing methods: (1) lack of the capability to model the long-dependency interactions between entities across different stages; (2) unable to exploit the incremental characteristics when KGs emerge in sequence. To address the problems effectively, we dive into the practical scenario formulated as Sequential-emerging Knowledge Graphs (SEKGs), and propose a novel model entitled ISE2 (Inductive Sequential Emerging Embedding). Specifically, ISE2 is composed of the following two modules: (1) a relational graph-transformer network is designed to capture long-dependency interactions with the full-graph receptive field; (2) an adaptive attention mechanism is developed to iteratively integrate emerging KGs into a whole, fully utilizing the incremental characteristic in SEKGs. Furthermore, a new benchmark that conforms to the data distribution of real-world sequential-emerging is constructed. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of ISE2 compared with the state-of-the-art methods in SEKGs scenario.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) translates entities and relations of knowledge graphs (KGs) into a low-dimensional vector space, enabling an efficient way of predicting missing facts. Generally, KGE models are trained with positive and negative examples, discriminating positives against negatives. Nevertheless, KGs contain only positive facts; KGE training requires generating negatives from non-observed ones in KGs, referred to as negative sampling. Since KGE models are sensitive to inputs, negative sampling becomes crucial, and the quality of the negatives becomes critical in KGE training. Generative adversarial networks (GAN) and self-adversarial methods have recently been utilized in negative sampling to address the vanishing gradients observed with early negative sampling methods. However, they introduce the problem of false negatives with high probability. In this paper, we extend the idea of reducing false negatives by adopting a Tucker decomposition representation, i.e., TuckerDNCaching, to enhance the semantic soundness of latent relations among entities by introducing a relation feature space. TuckerDNCaching ensures the quality of generated negative samples, and the experimental results reflect that our proposed negative sampling method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art negative sampling methods.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) is a critical field aiming to transform the elements of knowledge graphs (KGs) into continuous spaces, offering great potential for structured data representation. In contemporary KGE research, the utilization of either hyperbolic or Euclidean space for knowledge graph Embedding is a common practice. However, knowledge graphs encompass diverse geometric data structures, including chains and hierarchies, whose hybrid nature exceeds the capacity of a single embedding space to capture effectively. This paper introduces a novel and highly effective approach called Unified Geometry Knowledge Graph Embedding (UniGE) to address the challenge of representing diverse geometric data in KGs. UniGE stands out as a novel KGE method that seamlessly integrates KGE in both Euclidean and hyperbolic geometric spaces. We introduce an embedding alignment method and fusion strategy, which harnesses optimal transport techniques and the Wasserstein barycenter method. Furthermore, we offer a comprehensive theoretical analysis to substantiate the superiority of our approach, as evident from a more robust error bound. To substantiate the strength of UniGE, we conducted comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that UniGE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, aligning with the conclusions drawn from our theoretical analysis.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) have been widely used in the field of artificial intelligence, such as in information retrieval, natural language processing, recommendation systems, etc. However, the open nature of KGs often implies that they are incomplete, having self-defects. This creates the need to build a more complete knowledge graph for enhancing the practical utilization of KGs. Link prediction is a fundamental task in knowledge graph completion that utilizes existing relations to infer new relations so as to build a more complete knowledge graph. Numerous methods have been proposed to perform the link-prediction task based on various representation techniques. Among them, KG-embedding models have significantly advanced the state of the art in the past few years. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on KG-embedding models for link prediction in knowledge graphs. We first provide a theoretical analysis and comparison of existing methods proposed to date for generating KG embedding. Then, we investigate several representative models that are classified into five categories. Finally, we conducted experiments on two benchmark datasets to report comprehensive findings and provide some new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of existing models.",

Finding their embedded representations is thus highly desirable as it makes them easily operated on and reasoned with by machines. With this in mind, we propose a simple meta-strategy for embedding knowledge graphs using probabilistic coarsening. In this approach, a knowledge graph is first coarsened before being embedded by an arbitrary embedding method. The resulting coarse embeddings are then extended down as those of the initial knowledge graph. Although straightforward, this allows for faster training by reducing knowledge graph complexity while revealing its higher-order structures. We demonstrate this empirically on four real-world datasets, which show that coarse embeddings are learned faster and are often of higher quality. We conclude that coarsening is a recommended prepossessing step regardless of the underlying embedding method used.",

      "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graph completion (TKGC) has attracted significant attention. Previous works have led to great advances. However, most of methods still have the issue of one-sided acquisition of entity features and insufficient utilization of temporal facts from recent time steps. In this paper, we propose a model based on entity multi-encoding and temporal awareness (EmtE) to address these challenges. Entity multi-encoding aims to introduce entity slice feature encoding at the specific timestamp and time-aware entity feature which integrate time embeddings and static features of entity, thus deeply exploring the pluralistic information of entities in the temporal knowledge graph. Simultaneously, to better perceive the timing information, the model utilizes GRU in conjunction with a weight decay strategy to capture the temporal features of the historical facts. Experiments on the ICEWS14, ICEWS05-15, and GDELT datasets demonstrate that our model generally outperforms baseline models in terms of MRR, Hits@1, Hits@3 and Hits@10, effectively improving the performance of temporal knowledge graph completion.",

      "abstract": "Federated Knowledge Graph Embedding (FKGE) is an emerging collaborative learning technique for deriving expressive representations (i.e., embeddings) from client-maintained distributed knowledge graphs (KGs). However, poisoning attacks in FKGE, which lead to biased decisions by downstream applications, remain unexplored. This paper is the first work to systematize the risks of FKGE poisoning attacks, from which we develop a novel framework for poisoning attacks that force the victim client to predict specific false facts. Unlike centralized KGEs, FKGE maintains KGs locally, making direct injection of poisoned data challenging. Instead, attackers must create poisoned data without access to the victim's KG and inject it indirectly through FKGE aggregation. Specifically, to create poisoned data, the attacker first infers the targeted relations in the victim's local KG via a new KG component inference attack. Then, to accurately mislead the victim's embeddings via aggregation, the attacker locally trains a shadow model using the poisoned data and uses an optimized dynamic poisoning scheme to adjust the model and generate progressive poisoned updates. Our experimental results demonstrate the attack's effectiveness, achieving a remarkable success rate on various KGE models (e.g., 100% on TransE with WN18RR) while keeping the original task's performance nearly unchanged.",

To this effect, we carefully designed a human-AI team (HAIT) system dubbed KG-HAIT, which harnesses the human insights on KG by leveraging fully human-designed ad-hoc dynamic programming (DP) on KG to produce human insightful feature (HIF) vectors that capture the subgraph structural feature and semantic similarities. By integrating HIF vectors into the training of KGE models, notable improvements are observed across various benchmarks and metrics, accompanied by accelerated model convergence. Our results underscore the effectiveness of human-designed DP in the task of LP, emphasizing the pivotal role of collaboration between humans and AI on KG. We open avenues for further exploration and innovation through KG-HAlT, paving the way towards more effective and insightful KG analysis techniques.",

The effective location prediction of vehicle trajectory can help alleviate traffic congestion, reduce the occurrence of traffic accidents, and optimize the urban traffic system.

A Local Dynamic Graph Spatiotemporal–Long Short-Term Memory (LDGST-LSTM) was proposed in this paper to extract and fuse the POI knowledge and realize next location prediction. POI semantic information was learned by constructing the traffic knowledge graph, and spatial and temporal features were extracted by combining the Graph Attention Network (GAT) and temporal attention mechanism. The effectiveness of LDGST-LSTM was verified on two datasets, including Chengdu taxi trajectory data in August 2014 and October 2018. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed model were significantly improved compared with the benchmark models. The effects of major components in the proposed model were also evaluated through an ablation experiment.

      "abstract": "Contrastive learning is a promising solution to the problem of data sparsity in the field of recommendation system since it is able to extract self-supervised signals from raw data. The traditional contrastive learning-based sequential recommendation algorithms generate augmentations of original item sequences by utilizing crop, mask and reorder operations. However, those augmentation schemes destroy the underlying semantics of item sequences, resulting in difficulty in accurately defining positive and negative samples. To address this issue, we propose a contrastive translation based sequential recommendation algorithm, namely, CT4Rec. Specifically, CT4Rec generates augmented views of item sequences by injecting noises into embeddings of users and items, which is able to guarantee that the underlying semantics of augmented views are consistent with those of original item sequence. Hence, CT4Rec is able to effectively learn the invariances among the augmented views. In addition, the personalized translation operations are utilized to model the third-order relationships among entities. Moreover, it is difficult for contrastive learning-based recommendation algorithms with static temperature to simultaneously capture the differences among individual users/items and among the clusters of users/items. Hence, we utilize a dynamic temperature strategy to enhance CT4Rec, which endows CT4Rec with the capabilities of group-wise discrimination and instance discrimination. Our validation on five benchmark datasets shows that CT4Rec outperforms SOTA sequential recommendation methods. Our code is released at https://github.com/zar123123/CT4Rec.",

      "abstract": "Techniques for knowledge graph (KGs) enrichment have been increasingly crucial for commercial applications that rely on evolving product catalogues. However, because of the huge search space of potential enrichment, predictions from KG completion (KGC) methods suffer from low precision, making them unreliable for real-world catalogues. Moreover, candidate facts for enrichment have varied relevance to users. While making correct predictions for incomplete triplets in KGs has been the main focus of KGC method, the relevance of when to apply such predictions has been neglected. Motivated by the product search use case, we address the angle of generating relevant completion for a catalogue using user search behaviour and the users property association with a product. In this paper, we present our intuition for identifying enrichable data points and use general-purpose KGs to show-case the performance benefits. In particular, we extract entity-predicate pairs from user queries, which are more likely to be correct and relevant, and use these pairs to guide the prediction of KGC methods. We assess our method on two popular encyclopedia KGs, DBPedia and YAGO 4. Our results from both automatic and human evaluations show that query guidance can significantly improve the correctness and relevance of prediction.",

      "abstract": "Conventional knowledge graph embedding methods mainly assume that all entities at reasoning stage are available in the original training graph. But in real-world application scenarios, newly emerged entities are always inevitable, which results in the severe problem of out-of-knowledge-graph entities. Existing efforts on this issue mostly either utilize additional resources, e.g., entity descriptions, or simply aggregate in-knowledge-graph neighbors to embed these new entities inductively. However, high-quality additional resources are usually hard to obtain and existing neighbors of new entities may be too sparse to provide enough information for modeling these entities. Meanwhile, they may fail to integrate the rich information of ontological concepts, which provide a general figure of instance entities and usually remain unchanged in knowledge graph. To this end, we propose a novel inductive framework namely CatE to solve the sparsity problem with the enhancement from ontological concepts. Specifically, we first adopt the transformer encoder to model the complex contextual structure of the ontological concepts. Then, we further develop a template refinement strategy for generating the target entity embedding, where the concept embedding is used to form a basic skeleton of the target entity and the individual characteristics of the entity will be enriched by its existing neighbors. Finally, extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods.",

      "abstract": "Hyper-relational knowledge graphs can enhance the intelligence, efficiency, and reliability of industrial production by enabling equipment collaboration and optimizing supply chains. However, the construction of knowledge graphs in industrial fields faces significant challenges due to the complexity of hyper-relational data, the sparsity of industrial datasets, and limitations in existing link prediction methods, which struggle to capture the nuanced relationships and qualifiers often present in industrial scenarios. This paper proposes the HyLinker model, designed to improve the representation of entities and relations through modular components, including an entity neighbor aggregator, a relation qualifier aggregator, MoE-LSTM (Mixture of Experts Long Short-Term Memory), and a convolutional bidirectional interaction module. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs well on both public datasets and a self-constructed hoisting machine dataset. In the Mine Hoist Super-Relationship Dataset (MHSD-100), HyLinker outperforms the latest models, with improvements of 0.142 in MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) and 0.156 in Hit@1 (Hit Rate at Rank 1), effectively addressing the knowledge graph completion problem for hoisting machines and providing more accurate information for equipment maintenance and fault prediction. These results demonstrate the potential of HyLinker in overcoming current challenges and advancing the application of hyper-relational knowledge graphs in industrial contexts.",

      "abstract": "Relation extraction (RE) is an important task that aims to identify the relationships between entities in texts. While large language models (LLMs) have revealed remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capability for general zero and few-shot learning, recent studies indicate that current LLMs still struggle with zero and few-shot RE. Previous studies are mainly dedicated to design prompt formats and select good examples for improving ICL-based RE. Although both factors are vital for ICL, if one can fundamentally boost the ICL capability of LLMs in RE, the zero and few-shot RE performance via ICL would be significantly improved. To this end, we introduce Micre (Meta In-Context learning of LLMs for Relation Extraction), a new meta-training framework for zero and few-shot RE where an LLM is tuned to do ICL on a diverse collection of RE datasets (i.e., learning to learn in context for RE). Through meta-training, the model becomes more effectively to learn a new RE task in context by conditioning on a few training examples with no parameter updates or task-specific templates at inference time, enabling better zero and few-shot task generalization. We experiment Micre on various LLMs with different model scales and 12 public RE datasets, and then evaluate it on unseen RE benchmarks under zero and few-shot settings. Micre delivers comparable or superior performance compared to a range of baselines including supervised fine-tuning and typical in-context learning methods. We find that the gains are particular significant for larger model scales, and using a diverse set of the meta-training RE datasets is key to improvements. Empirically, we show that Micre can transfer the relation semantic knowledge via relation label name during inference on target RE datasets.",

TKG reasoning is aimed at forecasting new facts from existing events with timestamps and it is still faced with difficulties and challenges. In terms of different tasks in TKG reasoning, the researches can be broadly classified into interpolation and extrapolation. Extrapolated TKG reasoning attempts to predict facts in the future and can be more challenging by comparison with interpolation. Most existing works focus on modeling the time information, but only a few of them are designed definitely to model dynamic entities. Therefore, we propose a method, which deals with dynamic entities explicitly with self-attention mechanism, and adopts temporal-path-based reinforcement learning to predict future events. Through experiments on commonly used datasets for link prediction tasks, we demonstrate that our method shows good performance on most of datasets and modeling dynamic entities is of effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "In recommender systems, knowledge graph (KG) can offer critical information that is lacking in the original user-item interaction graph (IG). Recent process has explored this direction and shows that contrastive learning is a promising way to integrate both. However, we observe that existing KG-enhanced recommenders struggle in balancing between the two contrastive views of IG and KG, making them sometimes even less effective than simply applying contrastive learning on IG without using KG. In this paper, we propose a new contrastive learning framework for KG-enhanced recommendation. Specifically, to make full use of the knowledge, we construct two separate contrastive views for KG and IG, and maximize their mutual information; to ease the contrastive learning on the two views, we further fuse KG information into IG in a one-direction manner.Extensive experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method, compared to the state-of-the-art.

      "abstract": "Multi-task multi-agent reinforcement learning (M T-MARL) has recently gained attention for its potential to enhance MARL's adaptability across multiple tasks. However, it is challenging for existing multi-task learning methods to handle complex problems, as they are unable to handle unrelated tasks and possess limited knowledge transfer capabilities. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical approach that efficiently addresses these challenges. The high-level module utilizes a skill graph, while the low-level module employs a standard MARL algorithm. Our approach offers two contributions. First, we consider the MT-MARL problem in the context of unrelated tasks, expanding the scope of MTRL. Second, the skill graph is used as the upper layer of the standard hierarchical approach, with training independent of the lower layer, effectively handling unrelated tasks and enhancing knowledge transfer capabilities. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate these advantages and demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the latest hierarchical MAPPO algorithms.

We first convert structured knowledge graph data into natural language and then use these natural language prompts to fine-tune LLMs to enhance multi-hop link prediction in KGs. By converting the KG to natural language prompts, our framework is designed to learn the latent representations of entities and their interrelations. To show the efficacy of the KG-LLM Framework, we fine-tune three leading LLMs within this framework, including Flan-T5, LLaMa2 and Gemma. Further, we explore the framework's potential to provide LLMs with zero-shot capabilities for handling previously unseen prompts.

Meanwhile, contrastive learning (CL) is widely employed to enhance the distinctiveness of these representations.

In this paper, we proposed a novel node-based contrastive learning method for knowledge graph embedding, NC-KGE. NC-KGE enhances knowledge extraction in embeddings and speeds up training convergence by constructing appropriate contrastive node pairs on KGs. This scheme can be easily integrated with other knowledge graph embedding (KGE) methods. For downstream task such as biochemical relationship prediction, we have incorporated a relation-aware attention mechanism into NC-KGE, focusing on the semantic relationships and node interactions. Extensive experiments show that NC-KGE performs competitively with state-of-the-art models on public datasets like FB15k-237 and WN18RR. Particularly in biomedical relationship prediction tasks, NC-KGE outperforms all baselines on datasets such as PharmKG8k-28, DRKG17k-21, and BioKG72k-14, especially in predicting drug combination relationships.

      "abstract": "Developing robotic intelligent systems that can adapt quickly to unseen wild situations is one of the critical challenges in pursuing autonomous robotics. Although some impressive progress has been made in walking stability and skill learning in the field of legged robots, their ability for fast adaptation is still inferior to that of animals in nature. Animals are born with a massive set of skills needed to survive, and can quickly acquire new ones, by composing fundamental skills with limited experience. Inspired by this, we propose a novel framework, named Robot Skill Graph (RSG) for organizing a massive set of fundamental skills of robots and dexterously reusing them for fast adaptation. Bearing a structure similar to the Knowledge Graph (KG), RSG is composed of massive dynamic behavioral skills instead of static knowledge in KG and enables discovering implicit relations that exist in between the learning context and acquired skills of robots, serving as a starting point for understanding subtle patterns existing in robots' skill learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RSG can provide reliable skill inference upon new tasks and environments, and enable quadruped robots to adapt to new scenarios and quickly learn new skills.",

Such a shallow lookup results in a linear growth of memory consumption for storing the embedding matrix and incurs high computational costs when working with real-world KGs. Drawing parallels with subword tokenization commonly used in NLP, we explore the landscape of more parameter-efficient node embedding strategies with possibly sublinear memory requirements. To this end, we propose NodePiece, an anchor-based approach to learn a fixed-size entity vocabulary. In NodePiece, a vocabulary of subword/sub-entity units is constructed from anchor nodes in a graph with known relation types. Given such a fixed-size vocabulary, it is possible to bootstrap an encoding and embedding for any entity, including those unseen during training. Experiments show that NodePiece performs competitively in node classification, link prediction, and relation prediction tasks while retaining less than 10% of explicit nodes in a graph as anchors and often having 10x fewer parameters. To this end, we show that a NodePiece-enabled model outperforms existing shallow models on a large OGB WikiKG 2 graph having 70x fewer parameters.",

By employing translations, rotations, and superpositions within the vector space, a multiview convolutional neural network (MCNN) is constructed to enhance the accuracy of relation extraction through complementary and integrated feature representation. Integrating PTM with MCNN enables the construction of an emergency entity relationship extraction method based on PTM-MCNN. Neo4j is utilized for storing entity relationship triplets to construct an emergency knowledge graph. Through the utilization of the mutual information criterion, knowledge retrieval and matching are performed to accomplish the intelligent generation of emergency plans. The results indicate that PTM-MCNN achieves high recognition accuracy (F1 score of 92.2%), ensuring the reliability of the generated emergency plans. Related studies can effectively improve the intelligence of emergency management of water conservancy projects.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) is a semantic network with graph structure. Knowledge graphs are widely used in industry due to their ease of understanding and coding. Unfortunately, triples in knowledge graphs are usually missing and struggle to cope with complex tasks in existing scenarios. Multi-source knowledge graph is the knowledge graph from different devices, which contribute to the Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC). However, due to the privacy security of graph data from different devices, there are often security risks in sharing real data. Therefore, Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) based on federated setting is proposed to solve this problem successfully. In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments based on the federated embedding learning framework FedE, and show the impact of the number of clients and the training data on the accuracy of the graph embedding model, so as to analyze the possibility of using federated Settings in KGC in the future.",

      "abstract": "The task of link prediction aims to solve the problem of incomplete knowledge caused by the difficulty of collecting facts from the real world. GCNs-based models are widely applied to solve link prediction problems due to their sophistication, but GCNs-based models are suffering from two problems in the structure and training process. 1) The transformation methods of GCN layers become increasingly complex in GCN-based knowledge representation models; 2) Due to the incompleteness of the knowledge graph collection process, there are many uncollected true facts in the labeled negative samples. Therefore, this paper investigates the characteristic of the information aggregation coefficient (self-attention) of adjacent nodes and redesigns the self-attention mechanism of the GAT structure. Meanwhile, inspired by human thinking habits, we designed a semi-supervised self-training method over pre-trained models. Experimental results on the benchmark datasets FB15k-237 and WN18RR show that our proposed self-attention mechanism and semi-supervised self-training method can effectively improve the performance of the link prediction task. If you look at FB15k-237, for example, the proposed method improves Hits@1 by about 30%.",

To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel recommendation model named Dual-Intent-View Contrastive Learning network (DIVCL), inspired by recent advancements in contrastive and intent learning. DIVCL employs a dual-view representation learning approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), consisting of two distinct views: a local view based on the user-item interaction graph and a global view based on the user-item-entity knowledge graph. To further enhance learning, a set of intents are integrated into each user-item interaction as a separate class of nodes, fulfilling three crucial roles in the GNN learning process: (1) providing fine-grained representations of user-item interaction features, (2) acting as evaluators for filtering relevant relations in the knowledge graph, and (3) participating in contrastive learning to strengthen the model’s ability to handle sparse signals and redundant relations. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that DIVCL outperforms state-of-the-art models, showcasing its superior performance.

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become vitally important in modern recommender systems, effectively improving performance and interpretability. Fundamentally, recommender systems aim to identify user interests based on historical interactions and recommend suitable items. However, existing works overlook two key challenges: (1) an interest corresponds to a potentially large set of related items, and (2) the lack of explicit, fine-grained exploitation of KG information and interest connectivity. This leads to an inability to reflect distinctions between entities and interests when modeling them in a single way. Additionally, the granularity of concepts in the knowledge graphs used for recommendations tends to be coarse, failing to match the fine-grained nature of user interests. This homogenization limits the precise exploitation of knowledge graph data and interest connectivity. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel embedding-based model called InBox. Specifically, various knowledge graph entities and relations are embedded as points or boxes, while user interests are modeled as boxes encompassing interaction history. Representing interests as boxes enables containing collections of item points related to that interest. We further propose that an interest comprises diverse basic concepts, and box intersection naturally supports concept combination. Across three training steps, InBox significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like HAKG and KGIN on recommendation tasks. Further analysis provides meaningful insights into the variable value of different KG data for recommendations.",

      "abstract": "The knowledge graph completion algorithm can make the knowledge graph more complete and is currently a research hotspot in the field of artificial intelligence. The knowledge graph completion model is mainly defined in three aspects, the way of negative example generation, the design of scoring function and the design of loss function. The previous knowledge graph completion models only rely on factual view data to predict the missing links between entities and ignore the valuable common sense knowledge, and there is invalid negative sampling in knowledge graph embedding techniques; on the other hand, the existing graph neural network-based knowledge graph embedding models mainly consider capturing the graph structure around entities, and the relational representation is only used to update the entity embedding, which may miss the potentially useful information about the relational structure of potentially useful information. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes a two-view graph neural network-based knowledge graph completion model combined with common sense awareness. Common knowledge is first automatically extracted from fact triples with entity concepts to facilitate high-quality negative sampling, and then positive and weighted negative triples are fed into the two-view graph neural network-based knowledge graph embedding model to capture entity- and relationship-centric graph structures and learn vector representations of entities and relationships, and then the learned entity and relationship representations are fed into a weighted score function to return the final the final score. Extensive experimental and ablation studies on four datasets, FB15K, FB15K237, NELL995, and DBpedia-242, show that the model achieves better performance compared to the state-of-the-art models.",

Knowledge graph completion typically requires numerous training examples for each relation to increase their coverage. In KGs, long-tail relations are more prevalent, and freshly inserted links generally don’t have enough training triplets. One-shot relation learning is a transformational approach in the field of knowledge graphs, tackling the issues given by data scarcity and the necessity for fast reasoning mechanisms. Existing one-shot relation learning approaches rely on embedding-based methods based on the continuous vector-space. This study proposes GMatchBERT, a one-shot relation learning method with BERT embedding. The approach uses information from BERT embeddings and integrates the embeddings with one-hop graph topologies to create a matching metric. Experiments on two sets of data show that our suggested framework surpasses the existing approach for one-shot relation learning.",

      "abstract": "A large number of studies have emerged for Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion (MKGC) to predict the missing links in MKGs. However, fewer studies have been proposed to study the inductive MKGC (IMKGC) involving emerging entities unseen during training. Existing inductive approaches focus on learning textual entity representations, which neglect rich semantic information in visual modality. Moreover, they focus on aggregating structural neighbors from existing KGs, which of emerging entities are usually limited. However, the semantic neighbors are decoupled from the topology linkage and usually imply the true target entity. In this paper, we propose the IMKGC task and a semantic neighbor retrieval-enhanced IMKGC framework CMR, where the contrast brings the helpful semantic neighbors close, and then the memorize supports semantic neighbor retrieval to enhance inference. Specifically, we first propose a unified cross-modal contrastive learning to simultaneously capture the textual-visual and textual-textual correlations of query-entity pairs in a unified representation space. The contrastive learning increases the similarity of positive query-entity pairs, therefore making the representations of helpful semantic neighbors close. Then, we explicitly memorize the knowledge representations to support the semantic neighbor retrieval. At test time, we retrieve the nearest semantic neighbors and interpolate them to the query-entity similarity distribution to augment the final prediction. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CMR on three inductive MKGC datasets. Codes are available at https://github.com/OreOZhao/CMR.",

However, many current GNN-based KGC models have difficulty in effectively capturing and utilizing the substantial structure and global semantic information in Knowledge Graphs (KGs). For more effective use of GNN for KGC, we innovatively propose the Semantic Similarity-based Interaction Graph Attention Network (SemSI-GAT) for the KGC task. In SemSI-GAT, we utilize BERT, a pre-trained language model, to learn the global semantic information and obtain semantic similarity between entities and their neighbors. Furthermore, we creatively design a novel encoder network called the interaction graph attention network and introduce a semantic similarity sampling mechanism to optimize the aggregation of interaction information between neighbors. By aggregating local features with interaction features, this network can generate more expressive structural embeddings. This network generates more expressive embeddings by fusing global semantic information, local structure features, and interaction features. The experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed SemSI-GAT outperforms existing state-of-the-art KGC methods on four benchmark datasets.",

Compared with interpolation, extrapolation faces more challenges and difficulties, which is intended to forecast facts in the future. It’s worth noting that dealing with unseen entities effectively is one of important challenges, while only a few of prior work focuses on handling unseen data explicitly. To this end, we model unseen entities from semantic perspectives in this work, combining with temporal-path-based reinforcement learning, which guarantees the interpretability of reasoning.

Among all these studies, many prefer to utilize auxiliary information including those in the form of knowledge graph (KG) to reduce the reliance on labeled samples. In this survey, we have comprehensively reviewed over 90 articles about KG-aware research for two major sample shortage settings—zero-shot learning (ZSL) where some classes to be predicted have no labeled samples and few-shot learning (FSL) where some classes to be predicted have only a small number of labeled samples that are available. We first introduce KGs used in ZSL and FSL as well as their construction methods and then systematically categorize and summarize KG-aware ZSL and FSL methods, dividing them into different paradigms, such as the mapping-based, the data augmentation, the propagation-based, and the optimization-based. We next present different applications, including not only KG augmented prediction tasks such as image classification, question answering, text classification, and knowledge extraction but also KG completion tasks and some typical evaluation resources for each task.

To tackle this shortage, we propose a time-adaptive translating embedding model (TransTARec) for next POI recommendation that naturally incorporates temporal influence, sequential dynamics, and user preference within a single component. Methodologically, we treat a (previous timestamp, user, next timestamp) triplet as a union translation vector and develop a neural-based fusion operation to fuse user preference and temporal influence. The superiority of TransTARec, which is confirmed by extensive experiments on real-world datasets, comes from not only the introduction of temporal influence but also the direct unification with user preference and sequential dynamics.",

      "abstract": ": Knowledge graphs (KGs) help in resolving data inconsistencies and redundancies by organizing information in a unified structure, paving the way for building scalable, interpretable AI systems, as they provide a transparent way to trace reasoning paths and conclusions. The continuous evolving nature of information imposes for continuous knowledge graph completion (KGC). Thus, many research efforts are directed into building efficient KGC models. KGC models varied in the utilized knowledge features into the knowledge textual semantics, the graph relational structure, and temporal features, proving the crucial role of each. However, prior models neglect utilizing one or more types of features in the embedding and completion learning, missing the potential advantage of the neglected features for efficient completion learning. Thus, we propose an innovative sequential hybridization-based completion model, named Joint Features-based Knowledge Graph Completion (JF-KGC). The model encodes the latent semantics of knowledge, the structural topology, and the evolution of knowledge over time. This is a novel completion model that utilizes hybrid embedding of deep textual-based semantics, graph structure and temporal features for completion learning. The experiment conducted over YAGO11k and Wikidata12k benchmark datasets proved significant improvement over baselines in predicting missing knowledge with Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) equals 39.2% and 51.3% on YAGO11k and Wikidata12k, respectively.

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) can structurally organize large-scale information in the form of triples and significantly support many real-world applications. While most KG embedding algorithms hold the assumption that all triples are correct, considerable errors were inevitably injected during the construction process. It is urgent to develop effective error-aware KG embedding, since errors in KGs would lead to significant performance degradation in downstream applications. To this end, we propose a novel framework named Attributed Error-aware Knowledge Embedding (AEKE). It leverages the semantics contained in entity attributes to guide the KG embedding model learning against the impact of erroneous triples. We design two triple-level hypergraphs to model the topological structures of the KG and its attributes, respectively. The confidence score of each triple is jointly calculated based on self-contradictory within the triple, consistency between local and global structures, and homogeneity between structures and attributes. We leverage confidence scores to adaptively update the weighted aggregation in the multi-view graph learning framework and margin loss in KG embedding, such that potential errors will contribute little to KG learning. Experiments on three real-world KGs demonstrate that AEKE outperforms state-of-the-art KG embedding and error detection algorithms.",

The main contribution in this paper is to address the problems of low detection accuracy and inaccurate positioning of smoking detection.

Finally the proposed model, named YOLOv5s-Transformer, is deployed into edge computing platform NVIDIA Jeston Nano.

      "abstract": "To enhance the automation of urban rail scheduling systems in the face of malfunctions, the current prevalent approach involves constructing intelligent retrieval and question-answering systems based on urban rail fault data knowledge graphs to support dispatchers' decision-making. However, the knowledge graphs within the urban rail sector are currently crafted manually or semi-automatically, potentially neglecting the implicit semantic connections and obscured structural characteristics interlinking various entities. This oversight leads to incomplete rail fault knowledge graphs, adversely affecting the accuracy of intelligent question-answering systems. Consequently, it is essential to train a model to uncover these implicit semantic links and complete the rail fault knowledge graph. This paper proposes a knowledge graph embedding model that integrates relational weight constraints with neighborhood information. The concept of relational hyperplane is incorporated into the model, enabling the embedding vectors of entities and relations to adapt to the complex relational mappings in the urban rail domain. Furthermore, neighborhood information is integrated as supplementary information within the model using a self-attention mechanism, serving to further unearth the implicit semantic connections between rail fault entities, reduce the impact of small sample data on the model's representation capabilities and enhance the model's effectiveness in completing the knowledge graph. Finally, the experiments on a real rail fault dataset are conducted with the proposed model, and the result shows that the model proposed in this paper significantly outperforms other baseline models in triplet classification tasks and link prediction tasks.",

It aims to predict unseen edges by learning representations for all the entities and relations in a KG. A common concern when learning representations on traditional graphs is degree bias. It can affect graph algorithms by learning poor representations for lower-degree nodes, often leading to low performance on such nodes. However, there has been limited research on whether there exists degree bias for embedding-based KGC and how such bias affects the performance of KGC. In this paper, we validate the existence of degree bias in embedding-based KGC and identify the key factor to degree bias. We then introduce a novel data augmentation method, KG-Mixup, to generate synthetic triples to mitigate such bias. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method can improve various embedding-based KGC methods and outperform other methods tackling the bias problem on multiple benchmark datasets. 1",

      "abstract": "A multi-modal knowledge graph (MKG) includes triplets that consist of entities and relations and multi-modal auxiliary data. In recent years, multi-hop multi-modal knowledge graph reasoning (MMKGR) based on reinforcement learning (RL) has received extensive attention because it addresses the intrinsic incompleteness of MKG in an interpretable manner. However, its performance is limited by empirically designed rewards and sparse relations. In addition, this method has been designed for the transductive setting where test entities have been seen during training, and it works poorly in the inductive setting where test entities do not appear in the training set. To overcome these issues, we propose TMR (Topology-aware Multi-hop Reasoning), which can conduct MKG reasoning under inductive and transductive settings. Specifically, TMR mainly consists of two components. (1) The topology-aware inductive representation captures information from the directed relations of unseen entities, and aggregates query-related topology features in an attentive manner to generate the fine-grained entity-independent features. (2) After completing multi-modal feature fusion, the relation-augmented adaptive RL conducts multi-hop reasoning by eliminating manual rewards and dynamically adding actions. Finally, we construct new MKG datasets with different scales for inductive reasoning evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that TMP outperforms state-of-the-art MKGR methods under both inductive and transductive settings.",

To overcome the limitations, this study proposes a knowledge‐driven competitive intelligence framework for tourism management, utilizing knowledge graph (KG) construction and inference technologies. First, multi‐mode heterogeneous tourism data are integrated into a unified KG, including tourist check‐in, online text, and basic geographic information. Second, the spatial‐dependent GNN‐based model absorbing abundant spatial semantic knowledge from tourism‐oriented KG can enhance the performance of competition reasoning.

The obtained vectors are used to predict the missing links in a knowledge graph (KG). Although many KGs contain entity type information, most of the existing methods ignored the potential of the entity type information for the link prediction task. The proposed framework, which is called entity and entity type composition representation learning (EETCRL), obtains vector representations of both entities and entity types, which are combined and used for link prediction. Experimental results on three datasets show that the EETCRL outperforms the baseline methods in most cases. Furthermore, the results obtained from tests with different model sizes show that the proposed framework can achieve high performance even with a small model size. This paper also discusses the effect of considering information about entity types on the link prediction task by analyzing the experimental results.",

To address this issue, we construct a diet therapy knowledge graph by utilizing textual data and professional books provided by the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, from which we extract entities and relations. Building upon this foundation, we introduce a text representation technique predicated on contrastive learning, designed to augment the semantic richness of the knowledge graph and enhance the completion of the diet therapy knowledge graph. By conducting experiments on the diet therapy knowledge graph and public datasets, the results show that our method can capture the semantic information in the knowledge graph more efficiently compared to traditional methods. This provides new possibilities for research and practice in the field of traditional Chinese medicine diet therapy.

Recently, knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a powerful approach for graph-based representation in drug repurposing, encoding entities and relations to predict new connections and facilitate drug discovery. As COVID-19 has become a major public health concern, it is critical to establish an appropriate COVID-19 KG for drug repurposing to combat the spread of the virus. However, most publicly available COVID-19 KGs lack support for multi-relations and comprehensive entity types. Moreover, none of them originates from COVID-19-related drugs, making it challenging to identify effective treatments. To tackle these issues, we developed Drug-CoV, a drug-origin and multi-relational COVID-19 KG. We evaluated the quality of Drug-CoV by performing link prediction and comparing the results to another publicly available COVID-19 KG. Our results showed that Drug-CoV outperformed the comparing KG in predicting new links between entities. Overall, Drug-CoV represents a valuable resource for COVID-19 drug repurposing efforts and demonstrates the potential of KGs for facilitating drug discovery.",

      "abstract": "Addressing the issue that most current Knowledge Graph-based recommendation algorithms primarily focus on feature extraction from either the user or the item side, leading to suboptimal recommendation performance, a bipartite recommendation algorithm of knowledge graph and graph convolution network (BKGCN) is proposed. First, a neighborhood aggregation approach captures the higher-order relationships between each layer of the entity network, providing an initial description of the entities and browsing records in the user, project, and knowledge graphs. Next, by utilizing both the user and item sides to extract features, a knowledge-aware attention network based on users and items computes the internal information of triples. Finally, the neighborhood information obtained through the attention network from both the user and item sides is aggregated. The interaction probability between users and items is calculated using the inner product and normalization operations of the vectors. Utilizing two widely accessible datasets, namely Music Last.FM and Book-Crossing, comprehensive evaluations are undertaken through click-through rate prediction and Top-K recommendation tests, substantiating the effectiveness of the BKGCN algorithm. In comparison to the six foundational algorithms, BKGCN exhibits an enhancement of 1.4% in AUC and 0.3% in F1 over the best-performing baseline model on the Last.FM dataset. As for the Book-Crossing dataset, there is a notable improvement of 3.7% in AUC and 2.2% in F1, respectively.

      "title": "Beyond Triplets: Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graph Embedding for Link Prediction",
      "abstract": "Knowledge Graph (KG) embeddings are a powerful tool for predicting missing links in KGs. Existing techniques typically represent a KG as a set of triplets, where each triplet (h, r, t) links two entities h and t through a relation r, and learn entity/relation embeddings from such triplets while preserving such a structure. However, this triplet representation oversimplifies the complex nature of the data stored in the KG, in particular for hyper-relational facts, where each fact contains not only a base triplet (h, r, t), but also the associated key-value pairs (k, v). Even though a few recent techniques tried to learn from such data by transforming a hyper-relational fact into an n-ary representation (i.e., a set of key-value pairs only without triplets), they result in suboptimal models as they are unaware of the triplet structure, which serves as the fundamental data structure in modern KGs and preserves the essential information for link prediction. To address this issue, we propose HINGE, a hyper-relational KG embedding model, which directly learns from hyper-relational facts in a KG. HINGE captures not only the primary structural information of the KG encoded in the triplets, but also the correlation between each triplet and its associated key-value pairs. Our extensive evaluation shows the superiority of HINGE on various link prediction tasks over KGs. In particular, HINGE consistently outperforms not only the KG embedding methods learning from triplets only (by 0.81-41.45% depending on the link prediction tasks and settings), but also the methods learning from hyper-relational facts using the n-ary representation (by 13.2-84.1%).",

      "abstract": "Navigating materials performance databases efficiently is a persistent challenge in materials science and engineering, particularly in the selection of alloy materials. While recommendation systems address information overload, traditional approaches relying on historical user data face limitations such as data sparsity and cold-start issues. This study presents a novel recommendation model that integrates domain-specific knowledge graphs with large language models (LLMs) to enhance recommendation accuracy in alloy material selection. A knowledge graph for alloys is developed, encapsulating technical material data and relationships to improve retrieval and recommendation outcomes. LLMs are employed for label clustering and natural language-based instruction-following to craft user profiles and enhance data representation. Two graph enhancement strategies, integrated with attention mechanisms, effectively capture user preferences. Experimental results on a ferroalloy dataset demonstrate the model’s superior performance compared to baseline methods, significantly addressing data sparsity while offering personalized, accurate recommendations. This research bridges the gap between knowledge graphs and LLMs in recommendation systems, contributing a flexible, intelligent solution to streamline material selection processes.",

      "abstract": "Multi-modal data have recently been utilized to improve the performance of knowledge graph completion (KGC), attracting widespread research interest. However, they have been ignored in few-shot knowledge graph completion (FKGC), which aims to discover potential facts involving unseen relations that only appear in few-shot triples. The most relevant FKGC study simply concatenates various modal features, but the performance is still limited due to the following problems: (1) lack of exploiting significant multi-modal features in neighborhoods, and (2) ineffectively modeling inter-modal interactions in a few-shot setting. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel relational learning model entitled MMSN (Multi-Modal Siamese Network) for few-shot knowledge graph completion, which is composed of the following two primary modules: the Siamese multi-modal neighbor encoder (SMNE) and the meta-learning multi-modal knowledge representation decoder (MKRD). The module SMNE is developed to encode diverse modalities of neighbors by a Siamese attention network, fuse multi-modal information through a gating fusion network, and learn effective relational embeddings using an aggregator. The module MKRD is introduced to handle inter-modal interactions between multiple modalities and train the proposed model in a few-shot scenario. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed model MMSN outperforms the state-of-the-art FKGC models, including uni-modal and multi-modal models, on two real-world few-shot multi-modal datasets.",

However, to apply these methods to knowledge graphs, the data usually needs to be in an acceptable size and format. In fact, knowledge graphs normally have high dimensions and therefore we need to transform them to a low-dimensional vector space. An embedding is a low-dimensional space into which you can translate high dimensional vectors in a way that intrinsic features of the input data are preserved. In this review, we first explain knowledge graphs and their embedding and then review some of the random walk-based embedding methods that have been developed recently.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs contain rich knowledge about various entities and the relational information among them, while temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) describe and model the interactions of the entities over time. In this context, automatic temporal knowledge graph completion (TKGC) has gained great interest. Recent TKGC methods integrate advanced deep learning techniques, e.g., Transformers, and achieve superior model performance. However, this also introduces a large number of excessive parameters, which brings a heavier burden for parameter optimization. In this paper, we propose a simple but powerful graph encoder for TKGC, called TARGCN. TARGCN is parameter-efficient, and it extensively explores every entity's temporal context for learning contextualized representations. We find that instead of adopting various kinds of complex modules, it is more beneficial to efficiently capture the temporal contexts of entities. We experiment TARGCN on three benchmark datasets. Our model can achieve a more than 46% relative improvement on the GDELT dataset compared with state-of-the-art TKGC models. Meanwhile, it outperforms the strongest baseline on the ICEWS05-15 dataset with around 18% fewer parameters.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph completion is an essential task in the fields of graph mining and graph machine learning. Most contemporary approaches rely on geometric transformation to achieve knowledge graph completion, as geometry offers a well-defined mathematical foundation. For example, rotation transformations in rigid body transformation are frequently employed within quaternion spaces to model complex relation types in knowledge graphs. However, these models cannot effectively handle the hierarchical structure in the knowledge graph. As a result, the performance of knowledge graph completion suffers. To address this shortcoming of quaternion space, we propose a novel model that integrates hyperbolic space. Specifically, we perform a translation transformation in a hyperbolic space to obtain support vector embeddings that imply relation embedding. We then perform a rotation transformation with the Hamilton product in tangent space, treating the relation embedding as a rotation from the head entity embedding to the tail entity embedding. We verify the validity and generalization ability of our model on standard benchmark datasets including WN18RR, FB15k-237 and YAGO3-10. The experimental results show that our model achieves competitive results on MRR and H@K metrics. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/llqy123/HAQE-master.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) aims to reason over known facts and infer missing links but achieves weak performances on those sparse Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Recent works introduce text information as auxiliary features or apply graph densification to alleviate this challenge, but suffer from problems of ineffectively incorporating structure features and injecting noisy triples. In this paper, we solve the sparse KGC from these two motivations simultaneously and handle their respective drawbacks further, and propose a plug-and-play unified framework VEM$^2$L over sparse KGs. The basic idea of VEM$^2$L is to motivate a text-based KGC model and a structure-based KGC model to learn with each other to fuse respective knowledge into unity. To exploit text and structure features together in depth, we partition knowledge within models into two nonoverlapping parts: expressiveness ability on the training set and generalization ability upon unobserved queries. For the former, we motivate these two text-based and structure-based models to learn from each other on the training sets. And for the generalization ability, we propose a novel knowledge fusion strategy derived by the Variational EM (VEM) algorithm, during which we also apply a graph densification operation to alleviate the sparse graph problem further. Our graph densification is derived by VEM algorithm. Due to the convergence of EM algorithm, we guarantee the increase of likelihood function theoretically with less being impacted by noisy injected triples heavily. By combining these two fusion methods and graph densification, we propose the VEM$^2$L framework finally. Both detailed theoretical evidence, as well as qualitative experiments, demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed framework.",

      "abstract": "A recommendation algorithm combined with a knowledge graph enables auxiliary information on items to be obtained by using the knowledge graph to achieve better recommendations. However, the recommendation performance of existing methods relies heavily on the quality of the knowledge graph. Knowledge graphs often contain noise and irrelevant connections between items and entities in the real world. This knowledge graph sparsity and noise significantly amplifies the noise effects and hinders the accurate representation of user preferences. In response to these problems, an improved collaborative recommendation model is proposed which integrates knowledge embedding and graph contrastive learning. Specifically, we propose a knowledge contrastive learning scheme to mitigate noise within the knowledge graph during information aggregation, thereby enhancing the embedding quality of items. Simultaneously, to tackle the issue of insufficient user-side information in the knowledge graph, graph convolutional neural networks are utilized to propagate knowledge graph information from the item side to the user side, thereby enhancing the personalization capability of the recommendation system. Additionally, to resolve the over-smoothing issue in graph convolutional networks, a residual structure is employed to establish the message propagation network between adjacent layers of the same node, which expands the information propagation path. Experimental results on the Amazon-book and Yelp2018 public datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the best baseline models by 11.4% and 11.6%, respectively, in terms of the Recall@20 evaluation metric. This highlights the method’s efficacy in improving the recommendation accuracy and effectiveness when incorporating knowledge graphs into the recommendation process.",

Considering AI-generated content (AIGC) has shown great potentials for healthcare electronics (HE), a knowledge graph embedding model with AIGC called SEConv is proposed for medical knowledge graph completion. Firstly, a less resource-consuming model of self-attention mechanism is introduced to generate more expressive embedding representations, which contributes to deploying on resource-limited consumer electronics. Secondly, in order to extract more informative features from the triplets, a multilayer convolutional neural network is adopted to learn deeper structural features. Experiments have been implemented on the medical dataset of UMLS and DBpedia50, and other two benchmark datasets. And the results show that SEConv excels in learning more expressive and discriminative feature representations. Compared with the baseline models, SEConv achieves a substantial improvement, which verifies it can be used for healthcare prediction task and smart healthcare treatments.",

      "abstract": "Graphs offer unique insights into relationships between entities, complementing data modalities like text and images and enabling AI models to extend their capabilities beyond traditional tasks. However, learning from graphs often involves handling sensitive relationships in the data, raising significant privacy concerns. Existing privacy-preserving methods, such as DP-SGD, rely on gradient decoupling assumptions and are incompatible with relational learning due to the inherent dependencies between training samples. To address this challenge, we propose a privacy-preserving pipeline for relational learning that decouples dependencies in sampled relations for training, ensuring differential privacy through a tailored application of DP-SGD. We apply this approach to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), such as Llama2, on sensitive graph data while addressing the associated computational complexities. Our method is evaluated on four real-world text-attributed graphs, demonstrating significant improvements in relational learning tasks while maintaining robust privacy guarantees. Additionally, we analyze the trade-offs between privacy, utility, and computational efficiency, offering insights into the practical deployment of our approach for privacy-preserving relational learning.

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) represent world's facts in structured forms. KG completion exploits the existing facts in a KG to discover new ones. Translation-based embedding model (TransE) is a prominent formulation to do KG completion. Despite the efficiency of TransE in memory and time, it suffers from several limitations in encoding relation patterns such as many-to-many relation patterns, symmetric, reflexive etc. To tackle this problem, most of the attempts have circled around the revision of the score function of TransE i.e., proposing a more complicated score function such as Trans(A, D, G, H, R, etc) to mitigate the limitations. In this paper, we tackle this problem from a different perspective. We pose theoretical investigations of the main limitations of TransE in the light of loss function rather than the score function. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been investigated so far comprehensively. We show that by a proper selection of the loss function for training the TransE model, the main limitations of the model are mitigated. This is explained by setting upper-bound for the scores of positive samples, showing the region of truth (i.e., the region that a triple is considered positive by the model). Our theoretical proofs with experimental results fill the gap between the capability of translation-based class of embedding models and the loss function. The theories emphasize the importance of the selection of the loss functions for training the models. Our experimental evaluations on different loss functions used for training the models justify our theoretical proofs and confirm the importance of the loss functions on the performance.",

      "abstract": "As an effective knowledge organizing and modeling technique, knowledge graph has become a key topic in graph research, but the practical application of KG is limited by its incompleteness. In recent years, many knowledge graph embedding(KGE) methods for knowledge graph completion(KGC) based on graph neural networks(GNN) have been proposed. However, most GNN-based KGC models are still suffer from the encoder-decoder structure of low efficiency in aggregating neighborhood information and the difficulty of model training. This paper present an optimized model that incorporates Neighborhood information into knowledge inference, to improve the performance of KGC models based on multilayer perceptron network(MLP), which is named N-MlpE. We generate an input sequence that includes the query triplet and its neighbor entities and relationships, and then feed it to an adaptive filter module to remove useless neighbors for the inference to improve the accuracy of the inference, and reduce the computational complexity of training the model. The filtered sequence is then fed into a weight calculation module and a feature extraction module simultaneously, the former is designed based on selfattention to model the relevant rule inference, which enhances the interpretability of KGE models, and the latter is based on MLP and used to capture the long-distance interactions between triplets, which can significantly improve the accuracy of inference. Extensive experiments are conducted on two standard KG datasets WN18RR and FB15k237 to verify the effectiveness of N-MlpE, the results show that the accuracy of N-MlpE model outperforms most GNN-based models.",

The correctness and groundedness of the generated content need to be based on a verified context, such as results from Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). One important issue when adapting LLMs to a customized domain is that the generated responses are often incomplete, or the additions are not verified and may even be hallucinated. Prior studies on hallucination detection have focused on evaluation metrics, which are not easily adaptable to dynamic domains and can be vulnerable to attacks like jail-breaking.

Traditional approaches demonstrate limited effectiveness on FB15k-237, primarily because the underlying mechanism by which structural features of the dataset influence model performance remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we systematically investigate the impact mechanism of dataset structural features on link prediction performance. Firstly, we design a structured subgraph sampling strategy that ensures connectivity while constructing subgraphs with distinct structural features. Then, through correlation and sensitivity analyses conducted across several mainstream models, we observe that the distribution of relationship categories within subgraphs significantly affects performance, followed by the size of strongly connected components. Further exploration using the LIME model clarifies the intrinsic mechanism by which relationship categories influence link prediction performance, revealing that relationship categories primarily modulate the relative importance between entity embeddings and relationship embeddings and relationship embeddings, thereby affecting link prediction outcomes. These findings provide theoretical insights for addressing performance bottlenecks on FB15k-237, while the proposed analytical framework also offers methodological guidance for future studies dealing with structurally constrained datasets.",

Constructing a device-centric knowledge graph by extracting information from multiple sources related to power equipment is a valuable approach to enhance the intelligence level of asset management. Through the collection of pertinent authentic datasets, we have established a dataset for the state evaluation of power equipment, encompassing 35 types of relationships. To better suit the characteristics of concentrated relationship representations and varying lengths in textual descriptions, we propose a generative model called RoUIE, which is a method for constructing a knowledge graph of power equipment based on improved Universal Information Extraction (UIE). This model first utilizes a pre-trained language model based on rotational position encoding as the text encoder in the fine-tuning stage. Subsequently, we innovatively leverage the Distribution Focal Loss (DFL) to replace Binary Cross-Entropy Loss (BCE) as the loss function, further enhancing the model’s extraction performance. The experimental results demonstrate that compared to the UIE model and mainstream joint extraction benchmark models, RoUIE exhibits superior performance on the dataset we constructed. On a general Chinese dataset, the proposed model also outperforms baseline models, showcasing the model’s universal applicability.",

      "abstract": "The representation learning in knowledge graph aims to embed the semantic information of the research object into dense low dimensional distributed real valued vectors. The classical knowledge representation model, TransR, uses the relation specific matrix to represent the entities and relations in different semantic spaces, so as to solve the separation problem of semantic space. However, the TransR model only considers the different types of relations, ignores the entity types, and has defects in the processing of inverse relations. To solve the model problems, a novel knowledge representation method for multiple pattern embeddings based on entity-relation mapping matrix (M-TransER) is presented. The M-TransER model introduces the entity-relation mapping matrix, which makes the model consider the entity type while considering the relation type. On the basis that entities and relations are modeled as positive translation geometric distance, the inverse translation geometric distance model and the symmetrical relation model are fused. Eliminate the defects of the model in dealing with inverse relations, and improve the efficiency of symmetric relation processing. Experimental results on open datasets show that the M-TransER model has made great progress and demonstrated its superiority over the existing models and methods in both link prediction and triple classification tasks.",

      "abstract": "Classification methods based on fine-tuning pre-trained language models often require a large number of labeled samples; therefore, few-shot text classification has attracted considerable attention. Prompt learning is an effective method for addressing few-shot text classification tasks in low-resource settings. The essence of prompt tuning is to insert tokens into the input, thereby converting a text classification task into a masked language modeling problem. However, constructing appropriate prompt templates and verbalizers remains challenging, as manual prompts often require expert knowledge, while auto-constructing prompts is time-consuming. In addition, the extensive knowledge contained in entities and relations should not be ignored. To address these issues, we propose a structured knowledge prompt tuning (SKPT) method, which is a knowledge-enhanced prompt tuning approach. Specifically, SKPT includes three components: prompt template, prompt verbalizer, and training strategies. First, we insert virtual tokens into the prompt template based on open triples to introduce external knowledge. Second, we use an improved knowledgeable verbalizer to expand and filter the label words. Finally, we use structured knowledge constraints during the training phase to optimize the model. Through extensive experiments on few-shot text classification tasks with different settings, the effectiveness of our model has been demonstrated.",

      "abstract": "Open-world link prediction supports the knowledge representation and link prediction of new entities, enhancing the practical value of knowledge graphs in real-world applications. However, as research deepens, the performance improvements in open-world link prediction have gradually reached a bottleneck. Understanding its intrinsic impact mechanisms is crucial for identifying the key factors that limit performance, offering new theoretical insights and optimization strategies to overcome these bottlenecks. This study focuses on entity degree distribution, a core structural feature of knowledge graphs, and investigates its impact on the performance of open-world link prediction tasks. First, through experimental analysis, we confirm that entity degree distribution significantly affects link prediction model performance. Second, we reveal a strong positive correlation between entity degree and link prediction accuracy. Moreover, this study explores how entity degree influences embedding space distribution and weight updates during neural network training, uncovering the deeper mechanisms affecting open-world link prediction performance. The findings show that entity degree distribution has a significant impact on model training. By influencing the quality of the embedding space and weight updates, it indirectly affects the overall prediction performance of the model. In summary, this study not only highlights the critical role of entity degree distribution in open-world link prediction but also uncovers the intrinsic mechanisms through which it impacts model performance, providing valuable insights and directions for future research in this field.",

      "abstract": "Traffic data imputation is crucial for the reliability and efficiency of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), forming the foundation for downstream tasks like traffic prediction and management. However, existing deep learning-based imputation methods struggle with two significant challenges: poor performance under high missing data rates and the limited incorporation of external traffic-related factors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel knowledge graph-enhanced generative adversarial network (KG-GAN) for traffic data imputation. Our approach uniquely integrates external knowledge with traffic spatiotemporal dependencies to improve data imputation quality. Specifically, we construct a fine-grained knowledge graph (KG) that differentiates attributes and relationships of external factors such as points of interest (POI) and weather conditions, facilitating more robust knowledge representation learning. We then introduce a knowledge-aware embedding cell (EM-cell) that merges traffic data with these learned external representations, providing richer inputs for the spatiotemporal GAN. Extensive experiments on a large-scale real-world traffic dataset demonstrate that KG-GAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing data scenarios. Additionally, ablation studies confirm the superior performance gained from incorporating external knowledge, underscoring the importance of this approach in addressing complex missing data patterns.",

      "abstract": "With the continuous emergence of new knowledge, Knowledge Graph (KG) typically suffers from the incompleteness problem, hindering the performance of downstream applications. Thus, Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) has attracted considerable attention. However, existing KGC methods usually capture the coarse-grained information by directly interacting with the entity and relation, ignoring the important fine-grained information in them. To capture the fine-grained information, in this paper, we divide each entity/relation into several segments and propose a novel Multi-Level Interaction (MLI) based KGC method, which simultaneously interacts with the entity and relation at the fine-grained level and the coarse-grained level. The fine-grained interaction module applies the Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) mechanism to guarantee the sequentiality between segments, which facilitates the fine-grained feature interaction and does not obviously sacrifice the model complexity. Moreover, the coarse-grained interaction module designs a High-order Factorized Bilinear (HFB) operation to facilitate the coarse-grained interaction between the entity and relation by applying the tensor factorization based multi-head mechanism, which still effectively reduces its parameter scale. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances on the link prediction task over five well-established knowledge graph completion benchmarks.",

Using a quantitative approach, we selected a random Crossref sample of more than 115,000 records, which was then searched in seven databases (Dimensions, Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic, OpenAlex, Scilit, Semantic Scholar, and The Lens). Seven characteristics were analyzed (abstract, access, bibliographic info, document type, publication date, language, and identifiers), to observe fields that describe this information, the completeness rate of these fields, and the agreement among databases. The results show that academic search engines (Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic, and Semantic Scholar) gather less information and have a low degree of completeness. Conversely, third-party databases (Dimensions, OpenAlex, Scilit, and The Lens) have more metadata quality and a higher completeness rate. We conclude that academic search engines lack the ability to retrieve reliable descriptive data by crawling the web, and the main problem of third-party databases is the loss of information derived from integrating different sources.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph completion (KGC) tasks aim to infer missing facts in a knowledge graph (KG) for many knowledge-intensive applications. However, existing embedding-based KGC approaches primarily rely on factual triples, potentially leading to outcomes inconsistent with common sense. Besides, generating explicit common sense is often impractical or costly for a KG. To address these challenges, we propose a pluggable common sense-enhanced KGC framework that incorporates both fact and common sense for KGC. This framework is adaptable to different KGs based on their entity concept richness and has the capability to automatically generate explicit or implicit common sense from factual triples. Furthermore, we introduce common sense-guided negative sampling and a coarse-to-fine inference approach for KGs with rich entity concepts. For KGs without concepts, we propose a dual scoring scheme involving a relation-aware concept embedding mechanism. Importantly, our approach can be integrated as a pluggable module for many knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models, facilitating joint common sense and fact-driven training and inference. The experiments illustrate that our framework exhibits good scalability and outperforms existing models across various KGC tasks.",

      "abstract": " Knowledge graph question answering aims to answer natural language questions using structured knowledge graph data. The key to achieving this is having a correct semantic understanding of the question phrases. Query graph generation is an important step for knowledge graph question answering systems to tackle complex questions. Unlike simple single-hop questions, complex questions often require reasoning between multiple triples to get the right answer due to multiple entities, relationships and constraints, making it difficult to generate correct query graphs. In previous studies, researchers have primarily focused on improving the extraction and representation of question features, neglecting the prior structural information implicated in the question itself. In this paper, we propose a question structure classifier to classify the question structure, and alleviate the noise interference in query graph through classification results. In the classifier, we strengthen the information about the question structure through the attention mechanism, while weakening the irrelevant information. Moreover, a query graph sorting module based on feature cross-coding is proposed to sort candidate paths in the query graph using fine-grained feature interaction between words. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public datasets (MetaQA and WebQuestionsSP) and the experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other baselines.",

      "abstract": "Reconstructing the structure of causal graphical models from observational data is crucial for identifying causal mechanisms in scientific research. However, real-world noise and hidden factors can make it difficult to detect true underlying causal relationships. Current methods mainly rely on extensive expert analysis to correct wrongly identified connections, guiding structure learning toward more accurate causal interactions. This reliance on expert input demands significant manual effort and is risky due to potential erroneous judgments when handling complex causal interactions. To address these issues, this paper introduces a new, expert-free method to improve causal discovery. By utilizing the extensive resources of static knowledge bases across various fields, specifically knowledge graphs (KGs), we extract causal information related to the variables of interest and use these as prior constraints in the structure learning process. Unlike the detailed constraints provided by expert analysis, the information from KGs is more general, indicating the presence of certain paths without specifying exact connections or their lengths. We incorporate these constraints in a soft way to reduce potential noise in the KG-derived priors, ensuring that our method remains reliable. Moreover, we provide interfaces for various mainstream causal discovery methods to enhance the utility of our approach. For empirical validation, we apply our approach across multiple areas of causal discovery. The results show that our method effectively enhances data-based causal discovery and demonstrates its promising applications.",

      "abstract": "Designing efficient tools for modeling and analyzing transportation trajectories help improve various smart city services, e.g., location prediction, business recommendation and traffic forecasting. Yet with limited historical travel data, conventional tools are faced with challenges in representing the sophisticated contextual and spatiotemporal relationships inherent in transportation trajectories, while such trajectories have strong functional, geographical and time-specific characteristics. In this work, we propose an imitative transportation trajectory generation framework with multi-source urban knowledge enhancement. Specifically, we first construct Know-ST, an urban knowledge fusion framework that captures cross-domain knowledge (i.e., road network, point of interest, etc.) via tailored urban knowledge graph representation learning. The Know-ST preserves the temporal characteristics of trajectories and can continuously adapt to newly arriving trajectories. Moreover, we formulate the trajectory generation problem as a sequential imitation learning process, where an adversarially trained generator network is equipped to autonomously capture both the spatiotemporal and contextual information within individual transportation trajectories. Extensive experiments on real-world dataset show Know-ST outperforms multiple baselines under a variety of benchmarks, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

      "abstract": "The advent of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) has greatly impacted the field of Natural Language Processing. However, it is inconclusive how generative LLMs perform on domain-specific information extraction tasks. This study compares the performance of GPT-4 and a rule-based information extraction method based on ChemDataExtractor on band gap information extraction, a task that has important implications for the materials science domain. No training data is required for either method, which is desirable because there is a lack of training data in the materials science domain compared with a variety of material information that is of interest. Manual evaluation on 415 randomly selected articles showed that the GPT-4 model achieved a higher level of accuracy in extracting materials' band gap information than the rule-based method (Correctness 87.95% vs 51.08%, Partial correctness 11.33% vs 36.87%, incorrectness 0.72% vs 12.05%). Further analysis of the errors reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the GPT-4 model compared to the rule-based method. The GPT-4 model shows stronger performance in interdependency resolution and complicated material name recognition, while it also has weaknesses in hallucination, identifying band gap values, and identifying band gap types. Revised prompt based on the error analysis leads to improved accuracy for GPT-4. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to compare the GPT-4 model and ChemDataExtractor for the band gap extraction task. This study provides evidence to support using generative LLMs for domain-specific information extraction tasks.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) aims to map entities and relations of a knowledge graph (KG) into a low-dimensional and dense vector space via contrasting the positive and negative triples. In the training process of KGEs, negative sampling is essential to find high-quality negative triples since KGs only contain positive triples. Most existing negative sampling methods assume that non-existent triples with high scores are high-quality negative triples. However, negative triples sampled by these methods are likely to contain noise. Specifically, they ignore that non-existent triples with high scores might also be true facts due to the incompleteness of KGs, which are usually called false negative triples. To alleviate the above issue, we propose an easily pluggable denoising mixup method called DeMix, which generates high-quality triples by refining sampled negative triples in a self-supervised manner. Given a sampled unlabeled triple, DeMix firstly classifies it into a marginal pseudo-negative triple or a negative triple based on the judgment of the KGE model itself. Secondly, it selects an appropriate mixup partner for the current triple to synthesize a partially positive or a harder negative triple. Experimental results on the knowledge graph completion task show that the proposed DeMix is superior to other negative sampling techniques, ensuring corresponding KGEs a faster convergence and better link prediction results.",

The cybersecurity information stored in these databases is considered as security entities, and there are associations between these entities. However, due to manual maintenance and time delays, the relationships between some security entities remain undiscovered, hindering the analysis and understanding of network security personnel. Therefore, predicting the relationships between these cybersecurity entities is critical to improving cybersecurity analysis capabilities. To address this problem, we constructed a cybersecurity knowledge graph and designed a knowledge representation learning method based on hierarchical graph attention. This method effectively utilizes the structural and descriptive information of entities by hierarchically aggregating neighborhood features through entity-level and relation-level attention. We design extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our approach, and the results show that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods in predicting relations between security entities.",

      "abstract": "Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (TKGR) is the task of inferring missing facts for incomplete TKGs in complex scenarios (e.g., transductive and inductive settings), which has been gaining increasing attention. Recently, to mitigate dependence on structured connections in TKGs, text-based methods have been developed to utilize rich linguistic information from entity descriptions. However, suffering from the enormous parameters and inflexibility of pre-trained language models, existing text-based methods struggle to balance the textual knowledge and temporal information with computationally expensive purpose-built training strategies. To tap the potential of text-based models for TKGR in various complex scenarios, we propose ChapTER, a Contrastive historical modeling framework with prefix-tuning for TEmporal Reasoning. ChapTER feeds history-contextualized text into the pseudo-Siamese encoders to strike a textual-temporal balance via contrastive estimation between queries and candidates. By introducing virtual time prefix tokens, it applies a prefix-based tuning method to facilitate the frozen PLM capable for TKGR tasks under different settings. We evaluate ChapTER on four transductive and three few-shot inductive TKGR benchmarks, and experimental results demonstrate that ChapTER achieves superior performance compared to competitive baselines with only 0.17% tuned parameters. We conduct thorough analysis to verify the effectiveness, flexibility and efficiency of ChapTER.",

      "abstract": "General purpose language models often struggle with accurately identifying domain specific terminology in the medical field, resulting in suboptimal performance in named entity recognition (NER) tasks. This challenge is particularly pronounced in Chinese electronic medical records (EMRs), which lack clear word boundaries and contain complex medical expressions.This study proposes a novel NER method for Chinese EMRs that integrates ClinicalBERT, a language model pre trained on clinical corpora, with structured knowledge from a medical knowledge graph. Entity representations derived via Translating Embeddings (TransE) are incorporated to inject external semantic knowledge. Furthermore, the model fuses multiple character level features, including positional labels, contextual category clues, and semantic embeddings, to enhance boundary detection. The input text is annotated using the BIOES (Begin, Inside, Outside, End, Single) tagging scheme and subsequently encoded by ClinicalBERT. The encoded features are then passed through a bidirectional long short term memory (BiLSTM) network and a conditional random field (CRF) layer for final label prediction.Experiments conducted on publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves an F1 score of 89.44 percent, surpassing multiple existing baseline models in performance.These findings confirm that the integration of domain specific language modeling, structured medical knowledge, and enriched character level features significantly enhances NER accuracy in Chinese EMRs. The proposed method shows strong potential for practical deployment in clinical information extraction systems.",

      "abstract": "While linking records across large administrative datasets [“big data”] has the potential to revolutionize empirical social science research, many administrative data files do not have common identifiers and are thus not designed to be linked to others. To address this problem, researchers have developed probabilistic record linkage algorithms which use statistical patterns in identifying characteristics to perform linking tasks. Naturally, the accuracy of a candidate linking algorithm can be substantially improved when an algorithm has access to “ground-truth” examples—matches which can be validated using institutional knowledge or auxiliary data. Unfortunately, the cost of obtaining these examples is typically high, often requiring a researcher to manually review pairs of records in order to make an informed judgement about whether they are a match. When a pool of ground-truth information is unavailable, researchers can use “active learning” algorithms for linking, which ask the user to provide ground-truth information for select candidate pairs. In this paper, we investigate the value of providing ground-truth examples via active learning for linking performance. We confirm popular intuition that data linking can be dramatically improved with the availability of ground truth examples. But critically, in many real-world applications, only a relatively small number of tactically-selected ground-truth examples are needed to obtain most of the achievable gains. With a modest investment in ground truth, researchers can approximate the performance of a supervised learning algorithm that has access to a large database of ground truth examples using a readily available off-the-shelf tool.",

      "abstract": ": I will describe some examples in genomics and in neuroscience where one needs to ﬁnd diﬀerent fully data-driven adaptive statistical methods for testing or for estimation. In all those examples, the key is to ﬁnd concentration inequalities which either allow to very precisely calibrate the tuning parameter or to deeply understand how quantiles of test statistics are behaving. The main concentration tools are either \"Talagrand\" type inequalities for counting processes, Bernstein or Rosenthal type inequalities, or U-statistics - chaos inequalities. Abstract : In this lecture we present some new concentration inequalities for Feynman-Kac particle processes. We analyze diﬀerent types of stochastic particle models, including particle proﬁle occupation measures, genealogical tree based evolution models, particle free energies, as well as backward Markov chain particle models. We illustrate these results with a series of topics related to computational physics and biology, stochastic optimization, signal processing and Bayesian statistics, and many other probabilistic machine learning algorithms. Special emphasis is given to the stochastic modeling, and to the quantitative performance analysis of a series of advanced Monte Carlo methods, including particle ﬁlters, genetic type island models, Markov bridge models, and interacting particle Markov chain Monte Carlo methodologies. Abstract : The mathematical foundations of statistical learning theory heavily relies on concentration inequalities and empirical processes techniques. Learning an order relation over a Banach space involves performance measures which have higher order statistics, such as rank statistics, as empirical counterparts. The classical questions of consistency, universal and fast rates of convergence require dedicated tools which involve projection arguments and concentration inequalities for U- and R-processes. In the talk, we will present some results and open problems motivated by statistical problems of major interest. : in high Abstract : I will describe some results about concentration of volume of high dimensional convex bodies obtained in the last decade. Central limit theorem for convex bodies is one of the main achievement of these series of work. I will also present some open problems, like the thin shell conjecture and the problem of spectral gap, a conjecture due to Kannan Lovasz and Simonovits. Extension of these results to new classes of probability measures, like Cauchy measure or more generally κ -concave measures will be discussed. Abstract : Compressed sensing is an area of information theory where one seeks to recover an unknown signal from few measurements. A signal is often modeled as a vector in R n , and linear measurements are given as y = Ax where A is an m by n matrix. Best known results of compressed sensing are for random linear measurements, thus A is a random matrix. We will learn about some probabilistic successes and challenges in this area, with many connections to sampling theory, random matrix theory, and stochastic geometry. Abstract: I will provide a survey of recent results concerning probabilistic ap-proximations, obtained via the use of the Malliavin calculus of variations and the Stein and Chen-Stein methods. One advantage of this approach is that upper bounds are often expressed in terms of the variance of some random variable, so that well-known estimates (like e.g. given the Poincaré inequality and its general-izations) can be directly applied. I will also provide an overview of applications, ranging from fractional processes to random ﬁelds on homogeneous spaces, and from density estimates to geometric random graphs. Abstract : In the recent years the multi-armed bandit problem has attracted a lot of attention in the theoretical learning community. This growing interest is a con-sequence of the large number of problems that can be modelized as a multi-armed bandit: web advertisement, dynamic pricing, online optimization, ect. Bandits algorithms are also used as building blocks in more complicated scenarios such as reinforcement learning, model selection problems, or games. In this talk I will focus on the so-called adversarial model for multi-armed bandits. I will show an algorithm that solves a long-standing open problem regarding the minimax rate for this framework. I will also discuss the recent extension of this algorithm to bandits with a very large, but structured, set of arms (such as paths on a graph).

      "abstract": "Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is still a global health problem, with over 296 million chronically HBV-infected individuals worldwide. The merging data about clinical parameters, immune phenotyping data, and genetic information, together with AI models reliant on this integrated information, holds promise in effectively predicting the likelihood of functional cure in HBV-infected patients. Yet, the limited size of multidimensional datasets and characteristic of HBV cases poses a challenge for machine learning (ML) systems that typically require substantial data for pattern recognition. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing HyAI, a hybrid AI framework. HyAI employs knowledge graphs (KGs) and inductive learning to unearth meaningful patterns. HyAI relies on KG embedding models to learn a numerical representation of the HyAI KG in a k-dimensional vector space. Through community detection methods, closely related HBV patients are clustered using similarity metrics formulated from the acquired embeddings. HyAI is studied in a population of HBV patients integrated with multidimensional datasets. Our empirical analysis shows that HyAI uncovers immune markers that, together with clinical and demographic parameters, correspond to good predictors for forecasting the cure of chronic HBV infection.",

Moreover, link prediction and other tasks are carried out by vector calculation, and a variety of downstream tasks are achieved while retaining the structure of the knowledge graph itself. However, the existing knowledge representation learning models have certain defects when modeling complex relationships such as 1-N, N-1, and N-N, and the processing effect is not well. In order to better deal with complex relations, this paper proposes a knowledge representation learning model based on hyperboloid model, which emitters the knowledge graph into hyperbolic space for knowledge representation learning. Experiments are carried out on the public datasets FB15K, FB15K-237 and WN18RR. The experimental results show that the proposed model is superior to the baseline model in most evaluation indicators, which proves effectiveness of the proposed model.",

      "abstract": "Neuro-symbolic learning (NSL) models complex symbolic rule patterns into latent variable distributions by neural networks, which reduces rule search space and generates unseen rules to improve downstream task performance. Centralized NSL learning involves directly acquiring data from downstream tasks, which is not feasible for federated learning (FL). To address this limitation, we shift the focus from such a one-to-one interactive neuro-symbolic paradigm to one-to-many Federated Neuro-Symbolic Learning framework (FedNSL) with latent variables as the FL communication medium. Built on the basis of our novel reformulation of the NSL theory, FedNSL is capable of identifying and addressing rule distribution heterogeneity through a simple and effective Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence constraint on rule distribution applicable under the FL setting. It further theoretically adjusts variational expectation maximization (V-EM) to reduce the rule search space across domains. This is the first incorporation of distribution-coupled bilevel optimization into FL. Extensive experiments based on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate significant advantages of FedNSL compared to five state-of-the-art methods. It outperforms the best baseline by 17% and 29% in terms of unbalanced average training accuracy and unseen average testing accuracy, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs have garnered significant research attention and are widely used to enhance downstream applications. However, most current studies mainly focus on static knowledge graphs, whose facts do not change with time, and disregard their dynamic evolution over time. As a result, temporal knowledge graphs have attracted more attention because a large amount of structured knowledge exists only within a specific period. Knowledge graph representation learning aims to learn low-dimensional vector embeddings for entities and relations in a knowledge graph. The representation learning of temporal knowledge graphs incorporates time information into the standard knowledge graph framework and can model the dynamics of entities and relations over time. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of temporal knowledge graph representation learning and its applications. We begin with an introduction to the definitions, datasets, and evaluation metrics for temporal knowledge graph representation learning. Next, we propose a taxonomy based on the core technologies of temporal knowledge graph representation learning methods, and provide an in-depth analysis of different methods in each category. Finally, we present various downstream applications related to the temporal knowledge graphs. In the end, we conclude the paper and have an outlook on the future research directions in this area.",

In this paper, we propose a novel Large Language Models-based Knowledge Graph Completion framework, called SIKGC, which builds the structural information prompt to assist the knowledge graph completion tasks. Specifically, we arrange the triples in the knowledge graph as the sequences of text. By fusing the descriptions of entities, relations and their structural information as task-aware prompts, we input such prompts into large language models and regard the responses as prediction tasks. The experimental results on various public datasets show that the proposed method outperforms all baseline methods for the three knowledge completion tasks and attains state-of-the-art in triple classification. We also demonstrate that fine-tuning the smaller large language models (e.g., Baichuan2-13B, LLaMA2-13B, ChatGLM3-6B) with relevant data markedly enhances their KGC capabilities and significantly outperforms GPT-4.",

      "abstract": "Text-based knowledge graph completion methods take advantage of pre-trained language models (PLM) to enhance intrinsic semantic connections of raw triplets with detailed text descriptions. Typical methods in this branch map an input query (textual descriptions associated with an entity and a relation) and its candidate entities into feature vectors, respectively, and then maximize the probability of valid triples. These methods are gaining promising performance and increasing attention for the rapid development of large language models. According to the property of the language models, the more related and specific context information the input query provides, the more discriminative the resultant embedding will be. In this paper, through observation and validation, we find a neglected fact that the relation-aware neighbors of the head entities in queries could act as effective contexts for more precise link prediction. Driven by this finding, we propose a relation-aware anchor enhanced knowledge graph completion method (RAA-KGC). Specifically, in our method, to provide a reference of what might the target entity be like, we first generate anchor entities within the relation-aware neighborhood of the head entity. Then, by pulling the query embedding towards the neighborhoods of the anchors, it is tuned to be more discriminative for target entity matching. The results of our extensive experiments not only validate the efficacy of RAA-KGC but also reveal that by integrating our relation-aware anchor enhancement strategy, the performance of current leading methods can be notably enhanced without substantial modifications.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict missing facts in knowledge graphs (KGs), which is crucial as modern KGs remain largely incomplete. While training KGC models on multiple aligned KGs can improve performance, previous methods that rely on transferring raw data among KGs raise privacy concerns. To address this challenge, we propose a new federated learning framework that implicitly aggregates knowledge from multiple KGs without demanding raw data exchange and entity alignment. We treat each KG as a client that trains a local language model through textbased knowledge representation learning. A central server then aggregates the model weights from clients. As natural language provides a universal representation, the same knowledge thus has similar semantic representations across KGs. As such, the aggregated language model can leverage complementary knowledge from multilingual KGs without demanding raw user data sharing. Extensive experiments on a benchmark dataset demonstrate that our method substantially improves KGC on multilingual KGs, achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art alignment-based models without requiring any labeled alignments or raw user data sharing.

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict the missing links among knowledge graph (KG) entities. Though various methods have been developed for KGC, most of them can only deal with the KG entities seen in the training set and cannot perform well in predicting links concerning novel entities in the test set. Similar problem exists in temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs), and no previous temporal knowledge graph completion (TKGC) method is developed for modeling newly-emerged entities. Compared to KGs, TKGs require temporal reasoning techniques for modeling, which naturally increases the difficulty in dealing with novel, yet unseen entities. In this work, we focus on the inductive learning of unseen entities' representations on TKGs. We propose a few-shot out-of-graph (OOG) link prediction task for TKGs, where we predict the missing entities from the links concerning unseen entities by employing a meta-learning framework and utilizing the meta-information provided by only few edges associated with each unseen entity. We construct three new datasets for TKG few-shot OOG link prediction, and we propose a model that mines the concept-aware information among entities. Experimental results show that our model achieves superior performance on all three datasets and our concept-aware modeling component demonstrates a strong effect.",

      "abstract": "Geographic knowledge graph (GKG) embedding (referred to as knowledge representation learning) enables the mapping of geographic entities and geographic relationships into a continuous vector space, thereby better capturing the semantic and structural information among entities in geographic space. The representation learning of GKGs requires generating corresponding negative samples based on positive samples. Negative sampling is an essential component of GKG embedding models. However, traditional negative sample generation algorithms suffer from high error rates and poor adaptability to GKGs, leading to potential replacements of entities that may not be logically reasonable in terms of geographic relationships, thus reducing the model's performance and generalization ability. To address the aforementioned challenge, this paper proposes a novel negative sampling approach for GKGs embedding, predicated on the amalgamation of entity semantic congruence and clustering techniques. Primarily, the proposed methodology employs the FastText model to encode entities within the KG into vector representations, thereby aiming to procure precise semantic embeddings of said entities. Subsequently, for improved delineation of semantically akin entities, the K‐means algorithm is invoked to partition the entities into distinct clusters. Within the purview of negative sampling, entities within the same cluster as the substituted entity are randomly selected as negative instances, thus augmenting the fidelity of negative sample generation. Finally, experiments and analyses were conducted on the open‐source datasets WN18, FB15k, and the constructed geographic dataset GKG12. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy of GKG representation learning compared to the existing representation models.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs are graph-structured data models that provide a robust scheme for representing real-world relational facts with structured triples. The structural and factual information in knowledge graphs are extensively leveraged in various downstream applications. Unfortunately, knowledge graphs often contain incorrect triples due to the automated extraction processes. Therefore, to ensure the reliability and usability of knowledge graphs, it is crucial to identify and rectify these incorrect triples. However, this remains a challenging task, as knowledge graphs are intricate structures encompassing a vast number of triples formed by diverse entities, relations, and their complex interconnections. This paper proposes an effective method to enhance knowledge graph accuracy by introducing an active learning framework. The proposed framework integrates the advantages of machine-based models and human involvement to enable efficient and reliable improvement in knowledge graph accuracy. Additionally, the proposed method includes sampling strategies that consider the relation distribution in knowledge graphs to maximize the effectiveness of the active learning framework. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed active learning framework and sampling strategies in improving knowledge graph accuracy.

      "abstract": "In recent years, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have played a crucial role in the development of advanced knowledge-intensive applications, such as recommender systems and semantic search. However, the human sensory system is inherently multi-modal, as objects around us are often represented by a combination of multiple signals, such as visual and textual. Consequently, Multi-modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs), which combine structured knowledge representation with multiple modalities, represent a powerful extension of KGs. Although MMKGs can handle certain types of tasks (e.g., visual query answering) or queries that standard KGs cannot process, and they can effectively tackle some standard problems (e.g., entity alignment), we lack a widely accepted definition of MMKG. In this survey, we provide a rigorous definition of MMKGs along with a classification scheme based on how existing approaches address four fundamental challenges: representation, fusion, alignment, and translation, which are crucial to improving an MMKG. Our classification scheme is flexible and allows for easy incorporation of new approaches, as well as a comparison of two approaches in terms of how they address one of the fundamental challenges mentioned above. As the first comprehensive survey of MMKG, this article aims at inspiring and provide a reference for relevant researchers in the field of Artificial Intelligence.",

We propose DRUM, a scalable and differentiable approach for mining first-order logical rules from knowledge graphs that resolves these problems. We motivate our method by making a connection between learning confidence scores for each rule and low-rank tensor approximation. DRUM uses bidirectional RNNs to share useful information across the tasks of learning rules for different relations. We also empirically demonstrate the efficiency of DRUM over existing rule mining methods for inductive link prediction on a variety of benchmark datasets.",

      "abstract": "With the wide application of computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software, manufacturing enterprises have accumulated a wealth of numerical control (NC) programming data, providing valuable knowledge resources for new products’ development. Efficiently acquiring and reusing existing NC knowledge is essential for enhancing programming efficiency, improving product quality, and shortening manufacturing cycles. This study proposes an intelligent NC programming method based on knowledge graph. Firstly, the relevant knowledge in the NC programming domain is analyzed, and CAM knowledge elements are constructed to reduce the granularity of knowledge. Then, the ontology layer and data layer are constructed to achieve the development of the knowledge graph. Next, knowledge reasoning is performed on the knowledge graph through entity alignment and semantic rule-based reasoning. Furthermore, to address the issues of low reliability, limited applicability and need for frequent manual modifications in NC programming templates guided by the CAM knowledge graph, a CAM knowledge graph completion method based on neighborhood aggregation and semantic enhancement is proposed. Finally, an intelligent NC programming system based on knowledge graph is developed, and comparative experiments with mainstream algorithms on public datasets for few-shot knowledge graph completion are conducted, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method by experimenting with the key components of marine diesel engines.",

      "title": "Time-dependent Entity Embedding is not All You Need: A Re-evaluation of Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion Models under a Unified Framework",
      "abstract": "Various temporal knowledge graph (KG) completion models have been proposed in the recent literature. The models usually contain two parts, a temporal embedding layer and a score function derived from existing static KG modeling approaches. Since the approaches differ along several dimensions, including different score functions and training strategies, the individual contributions of different temporal embedding techniques to model performance are not always clear. In this work, we systematically study six temporal embedding approaches and empirically quantify their performance across a wide range of configurations with about 3000 experiments and 13159 GPU hours. We classify the temporal embeddings into two classes: (1) timestamp embeddings and (2) time-dependent entity embeddings. Despite the common belief that the latter is more expressive, an extensive experimental study shows that timestamp embeddings can achieve on-par or even better performance with significantly fewer parameters. Moreover, we find that when trained appropriately, the relative performance differences between various temporal embeddings often shrink and sometimes even reverse when compared to prior results. For example, TTransE (CITATION), one of the first temporal KG models, can outperform more recent architectures on ICEWS datasets. To foster further research, we provide the first unified open-source framework for temporal KG completion models with full composability, where temporal embeddings, score functions, loss functions, regularizers, and the explicit modeling of reciprocal relations can be combined arbitrarily.",

However, existing KGs are struggle with incompleteness, which motivates Knowledge graph completion (KGC), that is, predicting the lost links between entities based on observed triples. Reasoning over relation paths in incomplete KGs is popular. Nonetheless, some significant issues are still remained to be addressed, such as path noise and ambiguity of inferred relation. To address these problems, we propose a novel path augmented _Reasoning model with avoidance of Path noise and Disambiguation of inferred relation in this paper, referred to as RPD. In this model, we calculate the sum of resource allocation for each relation path to measure its reliability to avoid the inference of path noise. To address the ambiguity of an inferred relation, we introduce position embedding to denote the relation position along the path when learning path representation. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal RPD model in the handling of KGC tasks compared to SOTAs.",

      "abstract": "Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) incorporate temporal information to reflect the dynamic structural knowledge and evolutionary patterns of real-world facts. Nevertheless, TKGs are still limited in downstream applications due to the problem of incompleteness. Consequently, TKG completion (also known as link prediction) has been widely studied, with recent research focusing on incorporating independent embeddings of time or combining them with entities and relations to form temporal representations. However, most existing methods overlook the impact of history from a multi-granularity aspect. The inherent semantics of human-defined temporal granularities, such as ordinal dates, reveal general patterns to which facts typically adhere. To counter this limitation, this paper proposes \\textbf{L}earning \\textbf{G}ranularity \\textbf{Re}presentation (termed $\\mathsf{LGRe}$) for TKG completion. It comprises two main components: Granularity Representation Learning (GRL) and Adaptive Granularity Balancing (AGB). Specifically, GRL employs time-specific multi-layer convolutional neural networks to capture interactions between entities and relations at different granularities. After that, AGB generates adaptive weights for these embeddings according to temporal semantics, resulting in expressive representations of predictions. Moreover, to reflect similar semantics of adjacent timestamps, a temporal loss function is introduced. Extensive experimental results on four event benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of $\\mathsf{LGRe}$ in learning time-related representations.

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) are ubiquitous and widely used in various applications. However, most real-world knowledge graphs are incomplete, which significantly degrades their performance on downstream tasks. Additionally, the relationships in real-world knowledge graphs often follow a long-tail distribution, meaning that most relations are represented by only a few training triplets. To address these challenges, few-shot learning has been introduced. Few-shot KG completion aims to make accurate predictions for triplets involving novel relations when only a limited number of training triplets are available. Although many methods have been proposed, they typically learn each relation individually, overlooking the correlations between different tasks and the relevant information in previously trained tasks. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning-based few-shot KG completion method (TransNet). By learning the relationships between different tasks, TransNet effectively transfers knowledge from similar tasks to improve the current task's performance. Furthermore, by employing meta-learning, TransNet can generalize effectively to new, unseen relations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of TransNet over state-of-the-art methods. Code can be found at https://github.com/lihuiliullh/TransNet/tree/main",

      "abstract": "Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have emerged as a powerful representation for modeling complex relationships across diverse domains. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in leveraging their capabilities for graph learning. However, current approaches face significant challenges in embedding structural information into LLM-compatible formats, requiring either computationally expensive alignment mechanisms or manual graph verbalization techniques that often lose critical structural details. Moreover, these methods typically require labeled data from source domains for effective transfer learning, significantly constraining their adaptability. We propose STAG, a novel self-supervised framework that directly quantizes graph structural information into discrete tokens using a frozen codebook. Unlike traditional quantization approaches, our method employs soft assignment and KL divergence guided quantization to address the unique challenges of graph data, which lacks natural tokenization structures. Our framework enables both LLM-based and traditional learning approaches, supporting true zero-shot transfer learning without requiring labeled data even in the source domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple node classification benchmarks while maintaining compatibility with different LLM architectures, offering an elegant solution to bridging graph learning with LLMs.",

In this problem, a model trained on an existing KG needs to embed an emerging KG with unseen entities and relations. To solve this problem, we introduce the meta-learning setting, where a set of tasks are sampled on the existing KG to mimic the link prediction task on the emerging KG. Based on sampled tasks, we meta-train a graph neural network framework that can construct features for unseen components based on structural information and output embeddings for them. Experimental results show that our proposed method can effectively embed unseen components and outperforms models that consider inductive settings for KGs and baselines that directly use conventional KG embedding methods.",

      "abstract": "Learning and development, or L&D, plays an important role in talent management, which aims to improve the knowledge and capabilities of employees through a variety of performance-oriented training activities. Recently, with the rapid development of enterprise management information systems, many research efforts and industrial practices have been devoted to building personalized employee training course recommender systems. Nevertheless, a widespread challenge is how to provide explainable recommendations with the consideration of different learning motivations from talents. To this end, we propose CKGE, a contextualized knowledge graph (KG) embedding approach for developing an explainable training course recommender system. A novel perspective of CKGE is to integrate both the contextualized neighbor semantics and high-order connections as motivation-aware information for learning effective representations of talents and courses. Specifically, in CKGE, for each entity pair (i.e., the talent-course pair), we first construct a meta-graph, including the neighbors of each entity and the meta-paths between entities as motivation-aware information. Then, we develop a novel KG-based Transformer, which can serialize entities and paths in the meta-graph as a sequential input, with the specially designed relational attention and structural encoding mechanisms to better model the global dependence of KG structured data. Meanwhile, the local path mask prediction can effectively reveal the importance of different paths. As a result, CKGE not only can make precise predictions but also can discriminate the saliencies of meta-paths in characterizing corresponding preferences. Extensive experiments on real-world and public datasets clearly validate the effectiveness and interpretability of CKGE compared with state-of-the-art baselines.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is an effective method of finding reasoning pathways in incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs). To overcome the challenges of a large action space, a self-supervised pre-training method is proposed to warm up the policy network before the RL training stage. To alleviate the distributional mismatch issue in general self-supervised RL (SSRL), in our supervised learning (SL) stage, the agent selects actions based on the policy network and learns from generated labels; this self-generation of labels is the intuition behind the name self-supervised. With this training framework, the information density of our SL objective is increased and the agent is prevented from getting stuck with the early rewarded paths. Our self-supervised RL (SSRL) method improves the performance of RL by pairing it with the wide coverage achieved by SL during pretraining, since the breadth of the SL objective makes it infeasible to train an agent with that alone. We show that our SSRL model meets or exceeds current state-of-the-art results on all Hits@k and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) metrics on four large benchmark KG datasets. This SSRL method can be used as a plug-in for any RL architecture for a KGR task. We adopt two RL architectures, i.e., MINERVA and MultiHopKG as our baseline RL models and experimentally show that our SSRL model consistently outperforms both baselines on all of these four KG reasoning tasks.",

Through a knowledge graph-based approach, expert knowledge about the data and the application is included as contextual features to improve the recommendation process. A dashboard ontology is presented that describes key components in a dashboard ecosystem in order to semantically annotate all the knowledge in the graph. The recommender system leverages knowledge graph embedding and comparison techniques in combination with a context-aware collaborative filtering approach to derive recommendations based on the context, i.e., the state of the monitored system, and the end-user preferences. The proposed methodology is implemented and integrated in a dynamic dashboard solution. The resulting recommender system is evaluated on a smart healthcare use-case through a quantitative performance and scalability analysis as well as a qualitative user study.

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) usually contain rich internal semantic associations between entities and items, which can improve the quality of recommendation by building higher-order user-item relationships. However, many implicit higher-order relations do not guarantee the learning of high-quality representations and also face many challenges: i) the long-tailed distribution of entities leads to the sparsity of supervision signals represented by KG-enhanced item; ii) KG relationships in the real-world are noisy and contain topic-irrelevant connections between items and entities. To fill this research gap, we design a general Multilevel Knowledge Graph Contrastive Learning framework (MKGCL) that alleviates the noise and long-tail problems of knowledge graph-enhanced recommendation task, and to optimize the uniformity and alignment properties of the model representation output. Specifically, we design several simple and effective data augmentation methods by adding noise in the embedding space and replacing high co-occurrence relations, and design two contrastive learning methods with different paradigms to more effectively combat noise and improve recommendation accuracy.

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) has recently emerged as a powerful source of auxiliary information in the realm of knowledge-aware recommendation (KGR) systems. However, due to the lack of supervision signals caused by the sparse nature of user-item interactions, existing supervised graph neural network (GNN) models suffer from performance degradation. Moreover, the over-smoothing issue further limits the number of GNN layers or hops required to propagate messages - these models ignore the non-local information concealed deep within the knowledge graph. We propose the Quad-Tier Entity Fusion Contrastive Representation Learning (QTEF-CRL) knowledge-aware framework to achieve learning of deep user preferences from four perspectives: the collaborative, semantic, preference, and structural view. Unlike existing methods, the proposed tri-local and single-global quad-tier architecture exploits the knowledge graph holistically to achieve effective self-supervised representation learning. The newly-introduced preference view constructed from the collaborative knowledge graph (CKG) comprises a preference graph and preference-guided GNN that are specifically designed to capture non-local information explicitly. Experiments conducted on three datasets highlight the efficacy of our proposed model.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in knowledge graph embedding (KGE) rely on Euclidean/hyperbolic orthogonal relation transformations to model intrinsic logical patterns and topological structures. However, existing approaches are confined to rigid relational orthogonalization with restricted dimension and homogeneous geometry, leading to deficient modeling capability. In this work, we move beyond these approaches in terms of both dimension and geometry by introducing a powerful framework named GoldE, which features a universal orthogonal parameterization based on a generalized form of Householder reflection. Such parameterization can naturally achieve dimensional extension and geometric unification with theoretical guarantees, enabling our framework to simultaneously capture crucial logical patterns and inherent topological heterogeneity of knowledge graphs. Empirically, GoldE achieves state-of-the-art performance on three standard benchmarks. Codes are available at https://github.com/xxrep/GoldE.",

      "abstract": "Multimodel knowledge graph completion (MKGC) aims to predict missing entities in MKGs. Differing from prior Single-model knowledge graph completion efforts, MKGC leverages rich textual descriptions, images, and other multi-model information associated with entities. Traditional MKGC methods often use simple concatennation, weighted fusion, or tensor-based approaches for multi-modal information fusion, but they fail to capture the in-tra-modality and inter-modality dynamics. Moreover, traditional models like TransE and TransH, based on translational operations, struggle with complex relationships such as 1-N, N-N. To address these issue, this paper proposes a multi-modal information fusion enhanced by multi-level attention mechanism and relation-specific graph attention network method for MKGC. Firstly, obtaining text, attribute, and image embeddings of entities by leveraging pre-trained modals such as BERT and Vision Transformer. Secondly, using low-rank tensors for multimodal fusion and introducing self-attention and cross-attention blocks to capture complementary information within and across modalities respectively. Finally, constructing a multi-source node graph and a relation graph attention network is employed to capture the structural information of the graph. The ConvE modal is used as a decoder, and the performance is evaluated through link prediction tasks on real datasets. Experimental results show that new method out-performs other baselines, such as TransE, R-GCN, RSME, KG-BERT.",

The semantic association between the entities in the relational path is captured through the Bi-LSTM network. Finally, multiple relational paths are mixed and represented by the attention mechanism.

      "abstract": "Link prediction is a crucial component of knowledge graphs (KGs) as it aids in the analysis, completion, and application of KGs. Existing methods focus on learning the association between the observed graph structure and the links between a pair of nodes. However, they overlook the fact that KGs consist of interconnected nodes, and there exists a causal relationship between these nodes. Therefore, it is important to consider the causal relationship between nodes while performing link prediction in KGs. In this paper, we propose a Counterfactual Augmentation and Fusion Representation Model for Link Prediction (CARLP) that uses causality between nodes as a data augmentation of the KG. To address the poor effect of embedded representation due to the lack of link data in KG, we introduce Fusion Embedding to extract more dimensional information from KG. Additionally, we propose the ODE-Encoder to adjust the depth of the neural network by choosing a discretization scheme, making the neural network more accurate. Our experiments on KG Link Prediction demonstrate the effectiveness and genericity of the CRALP. It achieves 97.19% ± 0.18%, 97.99%± 0.17%, and 99.46%± 0.03% AUC values, and achieves 76.66%± 2.36%, 87.10%± 1.88%, and 60.21% ± 2.31% Hit@20 values on Cora, Citeseer and Facebook KGs. In particular, comparing with GCN, CRALP improves 5.08%, 3.92% and 13.00% on AUC, Hit@20 and AP, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graph (KG) completion has been widely studied to tackle the incompleteness issue (i.e., missing facts) in modern KGs. A fact in a KG is represented as a triplet (h, r, t) linking two entities h and t via a relation r. Existing work mostly consider link prediction to solve this problem, i.e., given two elements of a triplet predicting the missing one, such as (h, r, ?). This task has, however, a strong assumption on the two given elements in a triplet, which have to be correlated, resulting otherwise in meaningless predictions, such as (Marie Curie, headquarters location, ?). In addition, the KG completion problem has also been formulated as a relation prediction task, i.e., when predicting relations r for a given entity h. Without predicting t, this task is however a step away from the ultimate goal of KG completion. Against this background, this paper studies an instance completion task suggesting r-t pairs for a given h, i.e., (h, ?, ?). We propose an end-to-end solution called RETA (as it suggests the Relation and Tail for a given head entity) consisting of two components: a RETA-Filter and RETA-Grader. More precisely, our RETA-Filter first generates candidate r-t pairs for a given h by extracting and leveraging the schema of a KG; our RETA-Grader then evaluates and ranks the candidate r-t pairs considering the plausibility of both the candidate triplet and its corresponding schema using a newly-designed KG embedding model. We evaluate our methods against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on three real-world KG datasets. Results show that our RETA-Filter generates of high-quality candidate r-t pairs, outperforming the best baseline techniques while reducing by 10.61%-84.75% the candidate size under the same candidate quality guarantees. Moreover, our RETA-Grader also significantly outperforms state-of-the-art link prediction techniques on the instance completion task by 16.25%-65.92% across different datasets.",

      "abstract": "Relational direction plays an important role in multi-relational knowledge graphs (KGs). Current knowledge graph completion (KGC) methods suffer from insufficient utilization of relation correlation information. To address this issue, this article proposes a novel KGC framework, namely JGURD, which uses the encoder-decoder structure to achieve Joint Gradient Update with Relational Direction information. It combines graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with KG embedding methods, defining a update mechanism for entities and relationships to joint gradient updates. To incorporate entity information into the update of relationships, the forward propagation gradients of the triple score function are recorded, and entity gradient information is fused into relationship updates. To fully utilize relational direction information, a relation correlation graph (RCG) is constructed based on the topological patterns of relationship pairs. We design a multi-relation encoder combining GCN and multi-layer attention mechanism on RCG to comprehensively capture local and global structures of the RCG. To enhance the interpretability and adaptability of JGURD, three different decoders are employed. Experimental results show that JGURD outperforms the second-place HHAN-KGC, and the Hits@3 and MRR metrics on the FB15k dataset increased by 6.8% and 8.9%, respectively.",

In TKG, relation patterns inherent with temporality are required to be studied for representation learning and reasoning across temporal facts. However, existing methods can hardly model temporal relation patterns, nor can capture the intrinsic connections between relations when evolving over time, lacking of interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel temporal modeling method which represents temporal entities as Rotations in Quaternion Vector Space (RotateQVS) and relations as complex vectors in Hamilton’s quaternion space. We demonstrate our method can model key patterns of relations in TKG, such as symmetry, asymmetry, inverse, and can capture time-evolved relations by theory. And empirically, we show that our method can boost the performance of link prediction tasks over four temporal knowledge graph benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) is a powerful way to express Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which can help machines learn patterns hidden in the KGs. Relation patterns are useful hidden patterns, and they usually assist machines to predict unseen facts. Many existing KGE approaches can model some common relation patterns like symmetry/antisymmetry, inversion, and commutative composition patterns. However, most of them are weak in modeling noncommutative composition patterns. It means these approaches can not distinguish a lot of composite relations like “father’s mother” and “mother’s father”. In this work, we propose a new KGE method called QuatRotatScalE (QRSE) to overcome this weakness, since it utilizes rotation and scaling transformations of quaternions to design the relation embedding. Specifically, we embed the relations and entities into a quaternion vector space under the difference norm KGE framework. Since the multiplication of quaternions does not satisfy the commutative law, QRSE can model noncommutative composition patterns naturally. The experimental results on the synthetic dataset also support that QRSE has this ability. In addition, the experimental results on real-world datasets show that QRSE reaches state-of-the-art in link prediction problem.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs serve as a powerful tool to boost model performances for various applications covering computer vision, natural language processing, multimedia data mining, etc. The process of knowledge acquisition for human is multimodal in essence, covering text, image, video and audio modalities. However, existing multimodal knowledge graphs fail to cover all these four elements simultaneously, severely limiting their expressive powers in performance improvement for downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose TIVA-KG, a multimodal Knowledge Graph covering Text, Image, Video and Audio, which can benefit various downstream tasks. Our proposed TIVA-KG has two significant advantages over existing knowledge graphs in i) coverage of up to four modalities including text, image, video, audio, and ii) capability of triplet grounding which grounds multimodal relations to triples instead of entities. We further design a Quadruple Embedding Baseline (QEB) model to validate the necessity and efficacy of considering four modalities in KG. We conduct extensive experiments to test the proposed TIVA-KG with various knowledge graph representation approaches over link prediction task, demonstrating the benefits and necessity of introducing multiple modalities and triplet grounding. TIVA-KG is expected to promote further research on mining multimodal knowledge graph as well as the relevant downstream tasks in the community.

      "abstract": "User–item interactions on e-commerce platforms involve various intents, such as browsing and purchasing, which require fine-grained intent recognition. Existing recommendation methods incorporate latent intent into user–item interactions; however, they overlook important considerations. First, they fail to integrate intents with semantic information in knowledge graphs, neglecting intent interpretability. Second, they do not exploit the structural information from multiple views of latent intents in user–item interactions. This study established the intent with knowledge-aware multiview contrastive learning (IKMCL) model for explanation in recommendation systems. The proposed IKMCL model converts latent intent into fine-grained intent, calculates intent weights, mines latent semantic information, and learns the representation of user–item interactions through multiview intent contrastive learning. In particular, we combined fine-grained intents with a knowledge graph to calculate intent weights and capture intent semantics. The IKMCL model performs multiview intent contrastive learning at both coarse-grained and fine-grained levels to extract semantic relationships in user–item interactions and provide intent recommendations in structural and semantic views. In addition, an intent-relational path was designed based on multiview contrastive learning, enabling the capture of semantic information from latent intents and personalized item recommendations with interpretability. Experimental results using large benchmark datasets indicated that the proposed model outperformed other advanced methods, significantly improving recommendation performance.",

      "abstract": "Stemming from traditional knowledge graphs (KGs), hyper-relational KGs (HKGs) provide additional key-value pairs (i.e., qualifiers) for each KG fact that help to better restrict the fact validity. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in studying graph reasoning over HKGs. Meanwhile, as discussed in recent works that focus on temporal KGs (TKGs), world knowledge is ever-evolving, making it important to reason over temporal facts in KGs. Previous mainstream benchmark HKGs do not explicitly specify temporal information for each HKG fact. Therefore, almost all existing HKG reasoning approaches do not devise any module specifically for temporal reasoning. To better study temporal fact reasoning over HKGs, we propose a new type of data structure named hyper-relational TKG (HTKG). Every fact in an HTKG is coupled with a timestamp explicitly indicating its time validity. We develop two new benchmark HTKG datasets, i.e., Wiki-hy and YAGO-hy, and propose an HTKG reasoning model that efficiently models hyper-relational temporal facts. To support future research on this topic, we open-source our datasets and model.",

      "abstract": "Trajectory similarity computation is a fundamental problem in various applications (e.g., transportation optimization, behavioral study). Recent researches learn trajectory representations instead of point matching to realize more accurate and efficient trajectory similarity computation. However, these methods can still not be scaled to large datasets due to high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a novel hash learning method to encode the trajectories into binary hash codes and compute trajectory similarities by Hamming distances which is much more efficient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to conduct hash learning for trajectory similarity computation. Furthermore, unlike the Word2Vec model based on random walk strategy, we utilize hypergraph neural networks for the first time to learn the representations for the grids by constructing the hyperedges according to the real-life trajectories, resulting in more representative grid embeddings. In addition, we design a residual network into the multi-layer GRU to learn more discriminative trajectory representations. The proposed Hypergraph Hash Learning for Trajectory similarity commutation is an end-to-end framework and named HHL-Traj. Experimental results on two real-world trajectory datasets (i.e., Porto and Beijing) demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves up to 6.23% and 15.42% accuracy gains compared with state-of-the-art baselines in unhashed and hashed cases, respectively. The efficiency of trajectory similarity computation based on hash codes is also verified. Our code is available at https://github.com/caoyuan57/HHL-Traj.",

Gated graph neural network and TransR knowledge representation methods are used to extract interaction features in sequential graph and knowledge features in knowledge graphs, respectively. The two types of features will be fused and used to update the session preference matrix, and users can get the recommended explanation through the update degree of the session preference matrix. The experimental results on two public datasets of LFM and Movielens show that, when compared to the classical model, the Recall@10 metric of KGSRec on the two datasets is increased by 6.3% and 2.5%, respectively, and the NDCG@10 metric is increased by 0.46% and 0.36%, demonstrating the model's effectiveness.",

In addition, the methods with the usage of outer information are biased by the domain information. To address the issues, we propose a new bi-directional domain learning method to learn the representation of instances on a concept level with latent domain information in the multi-domain knowledge graphs. It consists of bi-directional sampling, multi-domain extension, and multi-channel attention to learn and extract concepts from domain knowledge graphs.

However, matrix factorization algorithms still have the drawback of not fully utilizing user feature information. To address this, we propose the TransH-MF model. This approach incorporates graph representation learning techniques grounded in matrix factorization. Initially, the TransH graph representation learning algorithm is utilized to project both entities and their relationships into a space, whose vector dimension is lower. Subsequently, the derived vectors are employed to assess the semantic proximity between entities. Ultimately, this proximity data is merged into the process of solving the optimal matrix factorization result.

This research offers a unique strategy based on Gibbs sampling and connection embedding to improve the model’s competency in handling link prediction within complex relationships. Gibbs sampling is initially used to obtain high-quality negative samples. Following that, the triplet entities are mapped onto a hyperplane defined by the connection. This procedure produces complicated relationship embeddings loaded with semantic information. Through metric learning, this process produces complex relationship embeddings imbued with semantic meaning.

      "abstract": "Background Accurate identification of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is critical in pharmacology, as DDIs can either enhance therapeutic efficacy or trigger adverse reactions when multiple medications are administered concurrently. Traditional methods for identifying DDIs are labor-intensive and time-consuming, prompting the development of computational alternatives. However, existing computational approaches frequently encounter challenges related to interpretability and struggle to effectively capture the complex, multi-level structures inherent in drug molecules. Specifically, they often fail to adequately analyze substructural components and neglect interactions across hierarchical structural levels, resulting in incomplete molecular representations. Results In this study, we propose a Hierarchical Learning Network with a co-attention mechanism tailored to molecular structure representation for predicting DDIs, named HLN-DDI. The proposed method advances existing approaches by explicitly encoding motif-level structures and capturing hierarchical molecular representations at atom-level, motif-level, and whole-molecule scales. These hierarchical representations are integrated using a co-attention mechanism and combined with interaction-type information to enhance predictive performance. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that HLN-DDI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmark datasets, achieving over 98% accuracy under transductive scenarios and surpassing 99% on various evaluation metrics. Moreover, HLN-DDI achieves a notable accuracy improvement of 2.75% in predicting DDIs involving unseen drugs. Practical assessments with real-world DDI scenarios further validate the efficacy and utility of our proposed model. Conclusion By leveraging hierarchical molecular structures and employing a co-attention mechanism to effectively integrate multi-level representations, HLN-DDI generates comprehensive and precise drug representations, leading to substantially improved predictions of potential drug-drug interactions.",

      "abstract": "Since knowledge graphs (KG) will continue to evolve in real scenarios, traditional KGE models are only suitable for static knowledge graphs. Therefore, continual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) has attracted the attention of researchers. Currently, a key challenge facing CKGE is that the model is prone to\"catastrophic forgetting\", resulting in the loss of previously learned knowledge. In order to effectively alleviate this problem, we propose a new CKGE model BAKE. First, we note that the Bayesian posterior update principle provides a natural continual learning strategy that is insensitive to data order and can theoretically effectively resist the forgetting of previous knowledge during data evolution. Different from the existing CKGE method, BAKE regards each batch of new data as a Bayesian update of the model prior. Under this framework, as long as the posterior distribution of the model is maintained, the model can better preserve the knowledge of early snapshots even after evolving through multiple time snapshots. Secondly, we propose a continual clustering method for CKGE, which further directly combats knowledge forgetting by constraining the evolution difference (or change amplitude) between new and old knowledge between different snapshots. We conduct extensive experiments on BAKE on multiple datasets, and the results show that BAKE significantly outperforms existing baseline models.",

Through the attention mechanism, models based on the graph attention network can learn the information of the neighboring node, improving knowledge graph completion and enriching the structural information. On the other hand, because of the shallow graph attention network, these models can only learn local structural information and cannot capture the global semantic properties of entities and relations. They also only use linear matrices to update relations, ignoring the impact of neighboring information on relations. We propose a fused semantic information graph attention network (FSI-GAT) to address the above challenges for knowledge graph completion. FSI-GAT consists of three modules: structural information learning module, semantic information learning module, and scoring module. The structural information learning module adopts the improved graph attention network to learn the local structural information of entities and relations; the semantic information learning module encodes the descriptive statements of entities and relations through the BERT pretrained language model to obtain the global semantic information; and the scoring module uses the ConvE to score the candidate tail entities.

Embedding a huge number of inter-relationships in terms of a small number of dimensions, require proper modeling in both cognitive and computational aspects. Recently, numerous objective functions regarding cognitive and computational aspects of natural languages are developed. Among which are the state-of-the-art methods of linearity, bilinearity, manifold-preserving kernels, projection-subspace, and analogical inference. However, the major challenge of such models lies in their loss functions that associate the dimension of relation embeddings to corresponding entity dimension. This leads to inaccurate prediction of corresponding relations among entities when counterparts are estimated wrongly. ProjE KGE, published by Bordes et al., due to low computational complexity and high potential for model improvement, is improved in this work regarding all translative and bilinear interactions while capturing entity nonlinearity. Experimental results on benchmark Knowledge Graphs (KGs) such as FB15K and WN18 show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art models in entity prediction task using linear and bilinear methods and other recent powerful ones. In addition, a parallel processing structure is proposed for the model in order to improve the scalability on large KGs.

However, unlike GNNs, FMs struggle to incorporate node features and generalise to unseen nodes in inductive settings. Our work bridges the gap between FMs and GNNs by proposing ReFactor GNNs. This new architecture draws upon both modelling paradigms, which previously were largely thought of as disjoint. Concretely, using a message-passing formalism, we show how FMs can be cast as GNNs by reformulating the gradient descent procedure as message-passing operations, which forms the basis of our ReFactor GNNs. Across a multitude of well-established KGC benchmarks, our ReFactor GNNs achieve comparable transductive performance to FMs, and state-of-the-art inductive performance while using an order of magnitude fewer parameters.",

      "abstract": "Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) augment traditional knowledge graphs by integrating temporal attributes, transforming them into a more nuanced and dynamic data structure capable of modeling real-world events. Representation learning techniques, particularly embedding-based methods, have been widely adopted for reasoning over TKGs. However, these methods often suffer from a black-box nature, which limits their ability to provide transparent reasoning chains and logically consistent link prediction outcomes. Moreover, many of these approaches overlook the duration of events, despite the fact that most real-world events span over periods of time rather than occurring instantaneously. This paper proposes a novel model, Interpretable Link Prediction on Continuous Time Durations (iLPCtd), which addresses both the interpretability of link predictions and the consideration of continuous temporal dynamics. By leveraging a random walk approach, iLPCtd extracts first-order temporal logical rules from given TKGs and applies them for subsequent link predictions. Importantly, the model incorporates the continuous nature of event timestamps to more accurately reflect real-world scenarios. To evaluate the model's performance, we constructed a new dataset, Satellite Observation to Earth (SOE), based on satellite meteorological observation workflows. Experimental results demonstrate that iLPCtd outperforms existing methods on this dataset. Additionally, experiments conducted on public datasets also show promising results, indicating that iLPCtd is not only capable of generating interpretable logical reasoning chains but also excels in handling complex temporal link prediction tasks, offering both theoretical and practical improvements in TKG reasoning.",

Although there have been many related works on knowledge graphs, there is currently a lack of research on the construction methods of policy knowledge graphs. This paper, focusing on the forestry field, designs a complete policy knowledge graph construction framework, including: firstly, proposing a fine-grained forestry policy domain ontology; then, proposing an unsupervised policy information extraction method, and finally, constructing a complete forestry policy knowledge graph. The experimental results show that the proposed ontology has good expressiveness and extensibility, and the policy information extraction method proposed in this paper achieves better results than other unsupervised methods. Furthermore, by analyzing the application of the knowledge graph in the retrieval-augmented-generation task of the large language models, the practical application value of the knowledge graph in the era of large language models is confirmed. The knowledge graph resource will be released on an open-source platform and can serve as the basic knowledge base for forestry policy-related intelligent systems. It can also be used for academic research. In addition, this study can provide reference and guidance for the construction of policy knowledge graphs in other fields.

      "abstract": "In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capability in addressing different graph learning and natural language tasks, respectively. Motivated by this, integrating LLMs with GNNs has been increasingly studied to acquire transferable knowledge across modalities, which leads to improved empirical performance in language and graph domains. However, existing studies mainly focused on a single-domain scenario by designing complicated integration techniques to manage multimodal data effectively. Therefore, a concise and generic learning framework for multi-domain tasks, i.e., graph and language domains, is highly desired yet remains under-exploited due to two major challenges. First, the language corpus of downstream tasks differs significantly from graph data, making it hard to bridge the knowledge gap between modalities. Second, not all knowledge demonstrates immediate benefits for downstream tasks, potentially introducing disruptive noise to context-sensitive models like LLMs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel plug-and-play framework for incorporating a lightweight cross-domain prompting method into both language and graph learning tasks. Specifically, we first convert the textual input into a domain-scalable prompt, which not only preserves the semantic and logical contents of the textual input, but also highlights related graph information as external knowledge for different domains. Then, we develop a reinforcement learning-based method to learn the optimal edge selection strategy for useful knowledge extraction, which profoundly sharpens the multi-domain model capabilities. In addition, we introduce a joint multi-view optimization module to regularize agent-level collaborative learning across two domains. Finally, extensive empirical justifications over 23 public and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our approach can be applied to diverse multi-domain tasks more accurately, robustly, and reasonably, and improve the performances of the state-of-the-art graph and language models in different learning paradigms.",

      "abstract": "Legal documents contain a wealth of valuable information, making them crucial for knowledge extraction and analysis. Extracting structured relationships between entities in legal texts can significantly enhance our understanding of legal concepts and facilitate the creation of knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose a structured approach combining relation extraction, graph reasoning, and clustering methods to effectively extract and represent legal relationships. Firstly, we employ state-of-the-art relation extraction techniques to identify relevant entities and their relationships from unstructured legal documents. These techniques leverage natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to recognize entity pairs and assign appropriate relationship labels. Next, we leverage graph reasoning to enhance the extracted relationships by incorporating additional contextual information. By representing the legal entities and their relationships as nodes and edges in a knowledge graph, we can apply reasoning algorithms to infer implicit relationships, resolve conflicts, and expand the graph based on the legal domain’s rules and regulations. Furthermore, we integrate clustering methods to organize related legal entities and relationships into meaningful clusters within the knowledge graph. By grouping semantically similar entities and relationships, we can uncover patterns, identify common themes, and enable more effective retrieval and analysis of legal information. Our experiments demonstrate that the structured approach, combining relation extraction, graph reasoning, and clustering methods, effectively extracts and represents legal relationships in a knowledge graph. The resulting graph provides a comprehensive and organized representation of legal concepts, facilitating legal research, decision-making, and knowledge discovery in the legal domain.",

Although existing KG representation learning models have shown promising performance, the theoretical mechanism behind existing models is much less well-understood. It is challenging to accurately portray the internal connections between models and build a competitive model systematically. To overcome this problem, a unified KG representation learning framework, called GrpKG, is proposed in this paper to model the KG representation learning from a generic groupoid perspective. We discover that many existing models are essentially the same in the sense of groupoid isomorphism and further provide transformation methods between different models. Moreover, we explore the applications of GrpKG in the model classification as well as other processes. The experiments on several benchmark data sets validate the effectiveness and superiority of our framework by comparing two proposed models (GrpQ8 and GrpM2) with the state-of-the-art models.",

      "abstract": "In biomedicine, the critical task is to decode Drug–Drug Interactions (DDIs) from complex biomedical texts. The scientific community employs Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) methods, enhanced with advanced neural network technologies, including capsule networks. However, existing methodologies primarily focus on the structural details of individual entities or relations within Biomedical Knowledge Graphs (BioKGs), overlooking the overall structural context of BioKGs, molecular structures, positional features of drug pairs, and their critical Relational Mapping Properties. To tackle the challenges identified, this study presents HSTrHouse an innovative hierarchical self-attention BioKGs embedding framework. This architecture integrates self-attention mechanisms with advanced neural network technologies, including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Graph Neural Network (GNN), for enhanced computational modeling in biomedical contexts. The model bifurcates the BioKGs into entity and relation layers for structural analysis. It employs self-attention across these layers, utilizing PubMedBERT and CNN for position feature extraction, and a GNN for drug pair molecular structure analysis. Then, we connect the position and molecular structure features to integrate them into the self-attention calculation of entity and relation. After that, the output of the self-attention layer is combined with the connected vectors of the position feature and molecular structure feature to obtain the final representation vector, and finally, to model the Relational Mapping Properties (RMPs), the representation vector is embedded into the complex vector space using Householder projections to obtain the BioKGs model. The paper validates HSTrHouse’s efficacy by comparing it with advanced models on three standard BioKGs for DDIs research.",

      "abstract": "Recently, a large amount of work has emerged for knowledge graph completion (KGC), which aims to reason over known facts and to infer the missing links. Meanwhile, contrastive learning has been applied to the KGC tasks, which can improve the representation quality of entities and relations. However, existing KGC approaches tend to improve their performance with high-dimensional embeddings and complex models, which make them suffer from large storage space and high training costs. Furthermore, contrastive loss with single positive sample learns little structural and semantic information in knowledge graphs due to the complex relation types. To address these challenges, we propose a novel knowledge graph completion model named ConKGC with the embedding dimension scaling and a relation-aware multi-positive contrastive loss. In order to achieve both space consumption reduction and model performance improvement, a new scoring function is proposed to map the raw low-dimensional embeddings of entities and relations to high-dimensional embedding space, and predict low-dimensional tail entities with latent semantic information of high-dimensional embeddings. In addition, ConKGC designs a multiple weak positive samples based contrastive loss under different relation types to maintain two important training targets, Alignment and Uniformity. This loss function and few parameters of the model ensure that ConKGC performs best and has fast convergence speed. Extensive experiments on three standard datasets confirm the effectiveness of our innovations, and the performance of ConKGC is significantly improved compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",

However, MKR still has two difficult issues. The first is how fully to capture users’ historical behavior pattern in the recommendation task and how fully to utilize deep multi-relation semantic information in the KGE task. The second is how to deal with datasets with different sparsity. Tackling these challenging issues, this paper proposes an enhanced MKR (EMKR) approach with two novelties. First, we propose to utilize the attention mechanism to aggregate users’ historical behavior for more accurately mining preferences in the recommendation task, and utilize the relation-aware graph convolutional neural network to fully capture the deep multi-relation neighborhood features in the KGE task, so as to address the first issue. Second, a two-part modeling strategy is proposed for a better representation of users in the recommendation task to expand the expressive ability of the model for adapting to datasets with different sparsity, so as to address the second issue. Extensive experiments are conducted on widely-used datasets and 11 approaches are used for comparison. The results show that the proposed EMKR can achieve substantial gains over the compared state-of-the-art approaches, especially in the situation where user-item interactions are sparse.",

In this paper, we propose a novel ontology embedding approach named EIKE (Extensional and Intensional Knowledge Embedding) by representing ontologies in two spaces, called extensional space and intensional space. EIKE presents a unified framework for embedding instances, concepts and their relations in an ontology, applying a geometry-based method to model extensional knowledge and a pretrained language model to model intensional knowledge, which can capture both structure information and textual information. Experimental results show that EIKE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in three datasets for both triple classification and link prediction, indicating that EIKE provides a more comprehensive and representative perspective of the domain.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) are commonly used as side information to enhance collaborative signals and improve recommendation quality. In the context of knowledge-aware recommendation (KGR), graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as promising solutions for modeling factual and semantic information in KGs. However, the long-tail distribution of entities leads to sparsity in supervision signals, which weakens the quality of item representation when utilizing KG enhancement. Additionally, the binary relation representation of KGs simplifies hyper-relational facts, making it challenging to model complex real-world information. Furthermore, the over-smoothing phenomenon results in indistinguishable representations and information loss. To address these challenges, we propose the SDK (Self-Supervised Dynamic Hypergraph Recommendation based on Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graph) framework. This framework establishes a cross-view hypergraph self-supervised learning mechanism for KG enhancement. Specifically, we model hyper-relational facts in KGs to capture interdependencies between entities under complete semantic conditions. With the refined representation, a hypergraph is dynamically constructed to preserve features in the deep vector space, thereby alleviating the over-smoothing problem. Furthermore, we mine external supervision signals from both the global perspective of the hypergraph and the local perspective of collaborative filtering (CF) to guide the model prediction process. Extensive experiments conducted on different datasets demonstrate the superiority of the SDK framework over state-of-the-art models. The results showcase its ability to alleviate the effects of over-smoothing and supervision signal sparsity.",

      "abstract": "Link prediction (LP) in knowledge graphs (KGs) uses embedding-based approaches and machine learning (ML) models to uncover new facts. In order to not overstate and accurately assess the performance of these techniques, their comprehensive and rigorous evaluation is needed. In this work, we suggest a framework to systematically trace and analyze bias---specifically, test leakage bias and sample selection bias---in training and testing knowledge graphs (KGs). The goal is to evaluate how bias affects the performance of LP models We specify a collection of bias measures in SPARQL (the W3C standard query language) to facilitate the analysis of any RDF graph with regard to its structural bias properties. Further, we evaluate our framework over seven state-of-the-art LP datasets (e.g., FB15k-237, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10) and the TransE model. Our findings show how bias, i.e., overrepresentation of entities and relations and pronounced information redundancy, is present across all datasets and how it advantageously impacts the reported performance of the LP model. With these results, we make a call for thorough assessments of data sources in order to discourage the use of biased datasets when appropriate, and to also help improve our understanding of how LP models work and to better interpret their produced output.",

      "abstract": "Complex Query Answering (CQA) is a challenge task of Knowledge Graph (KG). Due to the incompleteness of KGs, query embedding (QE) methods have been proposed to encode queries and entities into the same embedding space, and treat logical operators as neural set operators to obtain answers. However, these methods train KG embeddings and neural set operators concurrently on both simple (one-hop) and complex (multi-hop and logical) queries, which causes performance degradation on simple queries and low training efficiency. In this paper, we propose Query to Triple (Q2T), a novel approach that decouples the training for simple and complex queries. Q2T divides the training into two stages: (1) Pre-training a neural link predictor on simple queries to predict tail entities based on the head entity and relation. (2) Training a query encoder on complex queries to encode diverse complex queries into a unified triple form that can be efficiently solved by the pretrained neural link predictor. Our proposed Q2T is not only efficient to train, but also modular, thus easily adaptable to various neural link predictors that have been studied well. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, even without explicit modeling for neural set operators, Q2T still achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse complex queries over three public benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "In today's fast-paced world, advertisers are increasingly demanding real-time and accurate personalized ad delivery based on dynamic preference modeling, which emphasizes the temporality existing in both user preference and product characteristics. Meanwhile, with the development of graph neural networks (GNNs), E-commerce knowledge graphs (KG) with rich semantic relatedness are invoked to improve accuracy and provide appropriate explanations to encourage advertisers' willingness to invest in ad expenses. However, it is still challenging for existing methods to comprehensively consider both time-series interactions and graph-structured knowledge triples in a unified model, i.e., the case in knowledge-aware dynamic advertising. The interaction graph between users and products changes rapidly over time, while the knowledge in KG remains relatively stable. This results in an uneven distribution of temporal and semantic information, causing existing GNNs to fail in this scenario. In this work, we quantitatively define the above phenomenon as temporal unevenness and introduce the Incremental Leveling Network (InLN) with three novel techniques: the periodic-focusing window for node-level dynamic modeling, the biased temporal walk for subgraph-level dynamic modeling and the incremental leveling mechanism for KG updating. Verified by comprehensive and intensive experiments, InLN outperforms nine baseline models in three tasks by substantial margins, reaching up to a 9.9% improvement and averaging a 5.7% increase.",

However, previous works do not consider controlling information flow, which makes them hard to obtain useful latent information and limits model performance. Specifically, as human beings, predictions are usually made in multiple steps with every step filtering out irrelevant information and targeting at helpful information. In this paper, we first integrate iterative mechanism into knowledge graph embedding and propose a multi-step gated model which utilizes relations as queries to extract useful information from coarse to fine in multiple steps. First gate mechanism is adopted to control information flow by the interaction between entity and relation with multiple steps. Then we repeat the gate cell for several times to refine the information incrementally. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on most benchmark datasets compared to strong baselines. Further analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our model and its scalability on large knowledge graphs.",

      "abstract": "Spatio-temporal deep learning models aims to utilize useful patterns in such data to support tasks like prediction. However, previous deep learning models designed for specific tasks typically require separate training for each use case, leading to increased computational and storage costs. To address this issue, spatio-temporal foundation models have emerged, offering a unified framework capable of solving multiple spatio-temporal tasks. These foundation models achieve remarkable success by learning general knowledge with spatio-temporal data or transferring the general capabilities of pre-trained language models. While previous surveys have explored spatio-temporal data and methodologies separately, they have ignored a comprehensive examination of how foundation models are designed, selected, pre-trained, and adapted. As a result, the overall pipeline for spatio-temporal foundation models remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we innovatively provide an up-to-date review of previous spatio-temporal foundation models from the pipeline perspective. The pipeline begins with an introduction to different types of spatio-temporal data, followed by details of data preprocessing and embedding techniques. The pipeline then presents a novel data property taxonomy to divide existing methods according to data sources and dependencies, providing efficient and effective model design and selection for researchers. On this basis, we further illustrate the training objectives of primitive models, as well as the adaptation techniques of transferred models. Overall, our survey provides a clear and structured pipeline to understand the connection between core elements of spatio-temporal foundation models while guiding researchers to get started quickly. Additionally, we introduce emerging opportunities such as multi-objective training in the field of spatio-temporal foundation models.",

      "abstract": "Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs), as an extension of static Knowledge Graphs (KGs), incorporate the temporal feature to express the transience of knowledge by describing when facts occur. TKG extrapolation aims to infer possible future facts based on known history, which has garnered significant attention in recent years. Some existing methods treat TKG as a sequence of independent subgraphs to model temporal evolution patterns, demonstrating impressive reasoning performance. However, they still have limitations: 1) In modeling subgraph semantic evolution, they usually neglect the internal structural interactions between subgraphs, which are actually crucial for encoding TKGs. 2) They overlook the potential smooth features that do not lead to semantic changes, which should be distinguished from the semantic evolution process. Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Multi-span Evolutionary Network (DiMNet) for TKG reasoning. Specifically, we design a multi-span evolution strategy that captures local neighbor features while perceiving historical neighbor semantic information, thus enabling internal interactions between subgraphs during the evolution process. To maximize the capture of semantic change patterns, we design a disentangle component that adaptively separates nodes' active and stable features, used to dynamically control the influence of historical semantics on future evolution. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world TKG datasets show that DiMNet demonstrates substantial performance in TKG reasoning, and outperforms the state-of-the-art up to 22.7% in MRR.",

Most previous TKGC methods only consider predicting the missing links among the entities seen in the training set, while they are unable to achieve great performance in link prediction concerning newly-emerged unseen entities. Recently, a new task, i.e., TKG few-shot out-of-graph (OOG) link prediction, is proposed, where TKGC models are required to achieve great link prediction performance concerning newly-emerged entities that only have few-shot observed examples. In this work, we propose a TKGC method FITCARL that combines few-shot learning with reinforcement learning to solve this task. In FITCARL, an agent traverses through the whole TKG to search for the prediction answer. A policy network is designed to guide the search process based on the traversed path. To better address the data scarcity problem in the few-shot setting, we introduce a module that computes the confidence of each candidate action and integrate it into the policy for action selection. We also exploit the entity concept information with a novel concept regularizer to boost model performance. Experimental results show that FITCARL achieves stat-of-the-art performance on TKG few-shot OOG link prediction.",

(2023) proposed a link prediction method using the theoretical concept of double equivariance (equivariance for nodes&relation types), in contrast to the (single) equivariance (only for nodes) used to design Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this work we further extend the double equivariance concept to multi-task double equivariance, where we define link prediction in attributed multigraphs that can have distinct and potentially conflicting predictive patterns for different sets of relation types (multiple tasks). Our empirical results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach can effectively generalize to test graphs with multi-task structures without access to additional information.",

In particular, the tutorial will focus on temporal facts where the triples are enriched with temporal information, hyper-relational facts where the triples are enriched with qualifiers, n-ary facts describing relationships between multiple entities, and also facts that are augmented with literal and text descriptions.

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs are useful for many artificial intelligence tasks but often have missing data. Hence, a method for completing knowledge graphs is required. Existing approaches include embedding models, the Path Ranking Algorithm, and rule evaluation models. However, these approaches have limitations. For example, all the information is mixed and difficult to interpret in embedding models, and traditional rule evaluation models are basically slow. In this paper, we provide an integrated view of various approaches and combine them to compensate for their limitations. We first unify state-of-the-art embedding models, such as ComplEx and TorusE, reinterpreting them as a variant of translation-based models. Then, we show that these models utilize paths for link prediction and propose a method for evaluating rules based on this idea. Finally, we combine an embedding model and observed feature models to predict missing triples. This is possible because all of these models utilize paths. We also conduct experiments, including link prediction tasks, with standard datasets to evaluate our method and framework. The experiments show that our method can evaluate rules faster than traditional methods and that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of link prediction.",

      "title": "SGKGE: Semantically Guided Knowledge Graph Embeddings via Complementary Latent Representations",
      "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) completion is a challenging yet essential task that has attracted increasing attention in recent years. While entities in KGs typically present complex semantics (a phenomenon known as polysemy), previous works primarily focus on holistic but often inaccurate representations of entities, neglecting the diversity of their semantics. This limitation results in suboptimal representations for entities within KGs. To address this issue, we propose a new method termed semantically guided KG embeddings (SGKGE), which captures the precise semantics of entities in KGs from a semantics-guided perspective. Specifically, SGKGE first guides the learning of holistic semantics of entities through a hyperbolic manifold with learnable shared curvature and a geometric attention-fusion module, facilitating efficient reasoning. Subsequently, SGKGE captures fine-grained semantics through a set of Cartesian product Riemannian manifolds with distinct curvatures, coupled with a semantic interactions module. This approach enables SGKGE to produce more accurate entity semantics and enhance downstream applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on six well-established KG completion benchmarks.

This often necessitates developers to be involved to establish connection between users/researchers and the complex instrumentation.

Here we present a modular architecture for the Virtual Scientific Companion by assembling multiple AI-enabled cognitive blocks that each scaffolds large language models (LLMs) for a specialized task. With VISION, we performed LLM-based operation on the beamline workstation with low latency and demonstrated the first voice-controlled experiment at an x-ray scattering beamline. The modular and scalable architecture allows for easy adaptation to new instruments and capabilities.

      "abstract": "In knowledge graph completion (KGC), predicting triples involving emerging entities and/or relations, which are unseen when the KG embeddings are learned, has become a critical challenge. Subgraph reasoning with message passing is a promising and popular solution. Some recent methods have achieved good performance, but they (i) usually can only predict triples involving unseen entities alone, failing to address more realistic fully inductive situations with both unseen entities and unseen relations, and (ii) often conduct message passing over the entities with the relation patterns not fully utilized. In this study, we propose a new method named RMPI which uses a novel Relational Message Passing network for fully Inductive KGC. It passes messages directly between relations to make full use of the relation patterns for subgraph reasoning with new techniques on graph transformation, graph pruning, relation-aware neighborhood attention, addressing empty subgraphs, etc., and can utilize the relation semantics defined in the KG’s ontological schema. Extensive evaluation on multiple benchmarks has shown the effectiveness of RMPI’s techniques and its better performance compared with the existing methods that support fully inductive KGC. RMPI is also comparable to the state-of-the-art partially inductive KGC methods with very promising results achieved.

To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a new method named Trust-aware Multi-task Knowledge Graph (TMKG), which uses multi-task learning to integrate two kinds of side information of trust graph and knowledge graph in an end-to-end manner. First, we mine the intra-graph and inter-graph high-order connections through the node propagation and aggregation, and optimize the embedding of nodes through the implicit relationships obtained. Furthermore, through the shared cross unit, the connection relationships between each layer is mined, and the high-order interaction of nodes of different layers is obtained.

      "abstract": "In the era of large language models (LLMs), efficient and accurate data retrieval has become increasingly crucial for the use of domain-specific or private data in the retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Neural graph databases (NGDBs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm that combines the strengths of graph databases (GDBs) and neural networks to enable efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of graph-structured data which can be adaptively trained with LLMs. The usage of neural embedding storage and Complex neural logical Query Answering (CQA) provides NGDBs with generalization ability. When the graph is incomplete, by extracting latent patterns and representations, neural graph databases can fill gaps in the graph structure, revealing hidden relationships and enabling accurate query answering. Nevertheless, this capability comes with inherent trade-offs, as it introduces additional privacy risks to the domain-specific or private databases. Malicious attackers can infer more sensitive information in the database using well-designed queries such as from the answer sets of where Turing Award winners born before 1950 and after 1940 lived, the living places of Turing Award winner Hinton are probably exposed, although the living places may have been deleted in the training stage due to the privacy concerns. In this work, we propose a privacy-preserved neural graph database (P-NGDB) framework to alleviate the risks of privacy leakage in NGDBs. We introduce adversarial training techniques in the training stage to enforce the NGDBs to generate indistinguishable answers when queried with private information, enhancing the difficulty of inferring sensitive information through combinations of multiple innocuous queries. Extensive experimental results on three datasets show that our framework can effectively protect private information in the graph database while delivering high-quality public answers responses to queries.

However, the long-tailed issue of relations remains challenging for scene graph generation. This paper proposes a novel framework based on knowledge-driven data-driven joining to address the long-tail issues in scene graph generation. The proposed framework consists of two modules: the relation inference module and the prior knowledge learning module. The relation inference module aims to learn the relational features of entity pairs in images and the structural features of scene graphs. The prior knowledge learning module aims to learn the triplet representation from the knowledge graph and use it as prior knowledge to provide logical guidance and constraints for relation inference. This provides prior bias for relation inference to transfer the bias towards head categories to reasonable categories, thereby mitigating the long-tail problem. Experiment results indicate that the proposed framework outperforms on Visual Genome datasets and that the generated scene graph relation is logically reasonable.",

As a family of effective approaches for link predictions, embedding methods try to learn low-rank representations for both entities and relations such that the bilinear form defined therein is a well-behaved scoring function. Despite of their successful performances, existing bilinear forms overlook the modeling of relation compositions, resulting in lacks of interpretability for reasoning on KG. To fulfill this gap, we propose a new model called DihEdral, named after dihedral symmetry group. This new model learns knowledge graph embeddings that can capture relation compositions by nature. Furthermore, our approach models the relation embeddings parametrized by discrete values, thereby decrease the solution space drastically. Our experiments show that DihEdral is able to capture all desired properties such as (skew-) symmetry, inversion and (non-) Abelian composition, and outperforms existing bilinear form based approach and is comparable to or better than deep learning models such as ConvE.",

      "abstract": "Link prediction aims to infer missing valid triplets to complete knowledge graphs, with recent inclusion of multimodal information to enrich entity representations. Existing methods project multimodal information into a unified embedding space or learn modality-specific features separately for later integration. However, performance was limited in such studies due to neglecting the modalities compatibility and conflict semantic carried by entities in valid and invalid triplets. In this paper, we aim at modeling inter-entity modality interactions and thus propose a novel Modality Circular fusion approach (MoCi), which interweaves multimodal contextual of entities. Firstly, unlike most methods in this task that directly fuse modalities, we design a triplets-prompt modality contrastive pre-training to align modality semantics beforehand. Moreover, we propose a modality circular fusion model using a simple yet efficient multilinear transformation strategy. This allows explicit inter-entity modality interactions, distinguishing it from methods confined to fuse within individual entities. To the best of our knowledge, MoCi presents one of the pioneering frameworks that tailored to grasp inter-entity modality semantics for better link prediction. Extensive experiments on seven datasets demonstrate our model yields SOTA performance, confirming the efficacy of MoCi in modeling inter-entity modality interactions.

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs’ incompleteness has motivated many researchers to propose methods to automatically infer missing facts in knowledge graphs. Knowledge graph embedding has been an active research area for knowledge graph completion, with great improvement from the early TransE to the current state-of-the-art ConvKB. ConvKB considers a knowledge graph as a set of triples, and employs a convolutional neural network to capture global relationships and transitional characteristics between entities and relations in the knowledge graph. However, it only utilizes the triple information, and ignores the rich information contained in relation paths. In fact, a path of one relation describes the relation from some aspect in a fine-grained way. Therefore, it is beneficial to take relation paths into consideration for knowledge graph embedding. In this paper, we present a novel convolutional neural network-based embedding model PConvKB, which improves knowledge graph embedding by incorporating relation paths locally and globally. Specifically, we introduce attention mechanism to measure the local importance of relation paths. Moreover, we propose a simple yet effective measure DIPF to compute the global importance of relation paths. Experimental results show that our model achieves substantial improvements against state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning aims to predict missing entities in incomplete triples, which requires adequate structural information to derive accurate embeddings. However, KGs in the real world are not as dense as the idealized benchmarks, where sparse graph structures restrict the comprehensive structural information for superior performance. Although the logical semantics in KGs shows its potential in alleviating the impact of structural sparsity, there still exist some challenges. The deficient supervision and the semantic gap of logic make it difficult to introduce logical semantics in sparse KG reasoning. To this end, we propose a novel KG reasoning approach LoLLM injecting logic with the supervised information supplied by the Large Language Model (LLM), which is proved to be effective in evaluating and scoring. Firstly, LoLLM derives structural embeddings employing a graph convolutional network (GCN) with relation-aware and triple-aware attention. LoLLM secondly constructs reasoning paths instantiated from the first-order logic rules extracted from sparse KGs, and injects the logical semantics by a designed LLM-enhanced tuning strategy. We propose a textual loss (TL) and a logical loss (LL) in the optimization and obtain logical tuning embeddings of KG in this process. Finally, LoLLM fuses structural embeddings from the GCN and logical tuning embeddings from the LLM-enhanced tuning for scoring and incomplete triple prediction. Extensive experiments on two sparse KGs and a benchmark show that LoLLM outperforms state-of-the-art structure-based and Language Model (LM)-augmented baselines. Moreover, the logic rules with corresponding confidences provide explicit explanations as an interpretable paradigm.",

In this paper, a method for the semantic representation of the geospatial entity categories (denoted as feature embedding) is presented, taking advantage of the characteristic that regions with similar distributions of geospatial entity categories also have a certain level of similarity. To construct the entity category embedding, a spatial proximity graph of entities and an adjacency matrix of entity categories are created using a large number of geospatial entities obtained from OSM (OpenStreetMap). The cosine similarity algorithm is then employed to measure the similarity between these embeddings. Comparison experiments are then conducted by comparing the similarity results from the standard model. The results show that the results of this model are basically consistent with the standard model (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.7487), which verifies the effectiveness of the feature embedding extracted by this model. Based on this, this paper applies the feature embedding to the regional similarity task, which verifies the feasibility of using the model in the downstream task. It provides a new idea for realizing the formal expression of the unsupervised entity category semantics.",

The validity of co-authorship as a proxy for scientific collaboration is affected by this. Using bibliometric data from publications in the field of genomics, we examine the impact of hyperauthorship on metrics of scientific collaboration, and propose a method to determine a suitable cutoff threshold for hyperauthored papers and compare co-authorship networks with and without hyperauthored works. Our analysis reveals that including hyperauthored papers dramatically impacts the structural positioning of central authors and the topological characteristics of the network, while producing small influences on whole-network cohesion measures. We present two solutions to minimize the impact of hyperauthorship: using a mathematically grounded and reproducible calculation of threshold cutoff to exclude hyperauthored papers or fractional counting to weight network results. Our findings affirm the structural influences of hyperauthored papers and suggest that scholars should be mindful when using co-authorship networks to study scientific collaboration.",

To this end, we propose a bert-based relational prediction model, which extract relations between entities automatically. Concretely, we utilize the definition of domain terminologies as context of BERT and add special characters to the input of the model to capture the semantic features of domain terms. Through this method, the model can effectively obtain the semantic information of terminology definition and predict the relationship between them.

      "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graph representation approaches encounter significant challenges in handling the complex dynamic relations among entities, relations, and time. These challenges include the high difficulty of training and poor generalization performance, particularly with large datasets. To address these issues, this paper introduces curriculum learning strategies from machine learning, aiming to improve learning efficiency through effective curriculum planning. The proposed framework constructs a high-dimensional filtering model based on graph-based high-order receptive fields and employs a scoring model that uses a curriculum temperature strategy to evaluate the difficulty of temporal knowledge graph data quadruples at each stage. By progressively expanding the receptive field and dynamically adjusting the difficulty of learning samples, the model can better understand and capture multi-level information within the graph structure, thereby improving its generalization capabilities. Additionally, a temperature factor is introduced during model training to optimize parameter gradients, alongside a gradually increasing training strategy to reduce training difficulty. Experiments on the benchmark datasets ICEWS14 and ICEWS05-15 demonstrate that this framework not only significantly enhances model performance on these datasets but also substantially reduces training convergence time.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs equipped with graph network networks (GNNs) have led to a successful step forward in alleviating cold start problems in recommender systems. However, the performance highly depends on precious high-quality knowledge graphs and supervised labels. This paper argues that existing knowledge-graph-based recommendation methods still suffer from insufficiently exploiting sparse information and the mismatch between personalized interests and general knowledge. This paper proposes a model named Adaptive Knowledge Contrastive Learning with Dynamic Attention (AKCL-DA) to address the above challenges. Specifically, instead of building contrastive views by randomly discarding information, in this study, an adaptive data augmentation method was designed to leverage sparse information effectively. Furthermore, a personalized dynamic attention network was proposed to capture knowledge-aware personalized behaviors by dynamically adjusting user attention, therefore alleviating the mismatch between personalized behavior and general knowledge. Extensive experiments on Yelp2018, LastFM, and MovieLens datasets show that AKCL-DA achieves a strong performance, improving the NDCG by 4.82%, 13.66%, and 4.41% compared to state-of-the-art models, respectively.",

However, current state-of-the-art deep knowledge convolutional embedding models rely on external convolution kernels and conventional convolution processes, which limits the feature interaction capability of the model. This paper introduces a novel dynamic convolutional embedding model, named ConvD, which directly reshapes relation embeddings into multiple internal convolution kernels. This approach effectively enhances the feature interactions between relation embeddings and entity embeddings. Simultaneously, we incorporate a priori knowledge-optimized attention mechanism that assigns distinct contribution weights to multiple relational convolution kernels during dynamic convolution, further boosting the expressive power of the model. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that our proposed model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods, with average improvements ranging from 3.28% to 14.69% across all the evaluation metrics, while the number of parameters is reduced by 50.66% to 85.40% compared to other state-of-the-art models.",

      "abstract": "One main challenge in constructing a knowledge graph (KG) is to deal with ambiguity. Specifically, an entity in the graph can be assigned with multiple meanings while two or more entities considered to have different meanings may actually be the same. Assigning an entity with the correct meaning may involve re-evaluation of its relevant contexts. This costly operation typically involves searching for other similar entities within the KG such that the context can be determined. In this paper, a new model called DisambiguART is proposed leveraging multi-channel matching and inference in a self-organizing neural network for sense disambiguation in knowledge graphs. Unlike other disambiguation methods that rely on representation learning to identify the relevant contexts whereby similarities among entities are learned, DisambiguART extends the working principle of multi-channel Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) to conduct inferences directly over the graph representation through bi-directional interactions of bottom-up activations and top-down matching to find similar entities and select the correct meaning according to the right context. The proposed method is evaluated on the tasks of entity sense disambiguation in three domain KGs (jet-engine, biomedical, and kinship) and author-name disambiguation in bibliographic KGs, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of DisambiguART against the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graph completion (TKGC) refers to the prediction and filling in of missing facts on time series, which is essential for many downstream applications. However, many existing TKGC methods suffer from two limitations: (1) they only consider direct relations between entities and fail to express high-order structural dependencies between entities; and (2) they only leverage relation quadruples of temporal knowledge graphs, ignoring attribute information that contains rich semantic information. This makes them vulnerable to sparsity and incompleteness problems. In response, we propose HCAE, a temporal knowledge graph completion model that includes high-order connectivity and attribute information. This consists mainly of a recursive embedding propagation layer and a multi-head attention aggregation layer. The former leverages a recursive mechanism to update entity embeddings and can learn high-order connectivity information between entities in linear complexity time. The latter leverages an attention mechanism to understand the importance of different attributes for entity representation automatically. Combining high-order connectivity and attribute information can lead to more diverse entity representations and help enhance the model’s ability to infer unknown entities. Comparative experiments on three real-world datasets show that the model’s inference accuracy significantly outperforms other benchmark methods, especially regarding knowledge graphs with many unknown entities or relations.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, many knowledge graph completion models are proposed to assist the automatic construction of large knowledge graphs. While knowledge graph embedding models and textual information enhanced models are two tendencies in this area, they both suffer from some shortcomings, for example, relying too much on one single modal information may cause the limitation of performance. However, only a few works attempt to integrate multiple modalities. Besides, we found that the semantic similarity between head and tail entities correlates to the enhancing effect of textual information, and the semantic similarity is also related to relation types. We call this phenomenon relational sensitivity. To address these issues, we propose a relation sensitive textual information enhanced knowledge graph completion model (RSTIE-KGC). In our work, by integrating pre-trained language models (PLM) with knowledge graph embedding models, we fuse structural information and textual information, taking advantage of both topological and semantic features. Instead of finetuning the whole PLMs as existing models do, we choose a more efficient way, using frozen PLMs followed by an adapter to fit the text embeddings to our tasks, so that we can reduce training costs and enlarge the scale of negative samples, which maintains accuracy and effectiveness of our model. Based on the relational sensitivity, we propose our RelRank block, which selectively enhances textual information by calculating and filtering mean rank proportion (MRP) score for each relation type, thereby making better use of beneficial semantic information and reducing the noise and redundancy caused by textual information. The prediction process makes more refined use of textual information, as a result improving the accuracy of the model in the link prediction task. We conducted link prediction experiments on two real-world datasets. On FB15k-237, our model outperformed the current state-of-art textual information enhanced models in both MRR and Hit@k metrics. On WN18RR, our model also showed a stable prediction performance, and the results of both MRR and Hits@1 metrics were better than the most textual information enhanced models.",

      "abstract": "Drug–drug interactions (DDIs) are entities composed of different chemical substructures (functional groups). In existing methods that predict drug–drug interactions based on the usage of substructures, each node is perceived as the epicenter of a sub-pattern, and adjacent nodes eventually become centers of similar substructures, resulting in redundancy. Furthermore, the significant differences in structure and properties among compounds can lead to unrelated pairings, making it difficult to integrate information. This heterogeneity negatively affects the prediction results. In response to these challenges, we propose a drug–drug interaction prediction method based on substructure signature learning (DDI-SSL). This method extracts useful information from local subgraphs surrounding drugs and effectively utilizes substructures to assist in predicting drug side effects. Additionally, a deep clustering algorithm is used to aggregate similar substructures, allowing any individual subgraph to be reconstructed using this set of global signatures. Furthermore, we developed a layer-independent collaborative attention mechanism to model the mutual influence between drugs, generating signal strength scores for each class of drugs to mitigate noise caused by heterogeneity. Finally, we evaluated DDI-SSL on a comprehensive dataset and demonstrated improved performance in DDI prediction compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

The work is in line with Bosch research of data-driven solutions that intends to replace the traditional way of destroying cars, which is extremely costly and produces waste. The paper tackles two very challenging questions simultaneously: how large the welding spot diameter is; and to which car body the welded spot belongs to. The problem setting is difficult for traditional ML because there exist a high number of car bodies that should be assigned as class labels. We formulate the problem as link prediction, and experimented popular KGE methods on real industry data, with consideration of literals.

      "abstract": "In recent years, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have emerged as a crucial methodology for handling graph-structured data, exhibiting superior performance in semi-supervised classification tasks. However, most existing GCNs encounter two main issues in real-world scenarios: 1) graph-structured data may be incomplete, for example, containing outlier nodes and noisy edges, which poses a great challenge for GCNs to extract the relation information for classification tasks; 2) the scarcity of labeled data, often limited to a few-shot scenario, hampers the ability of GCNs to learn comprehensive embedding representations. To cope with these issues, we propose a novel framework called pseudo labeling collaborative multi-channel graph convolutional networks (PCM-GCN). First, considering incomplete graph-structured data, we develop two modules: graph generation module and multi-channel fusion module. The graph generation module is designed to extend the raw data to multiple graphs, which avoids being constrained by the effective expression ability of the raw data. Meanwhile, the multi-channel fusion module integrates embeddings from multiple graphs, capturing the complementarity among multiple channels. Second, to address the problem of sparse labels, we develop a confidence-based pseudo labeling module, appending confident data with pseudo label to the labeled set to enlarge the training set. PCM-GCN leverages pseudo labeling to enhance multi-channel embedding fusion, resulting in rich and comprehensive node embedding representation. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets have shown that PCM-GCN surpasses other state-of-the-art methods in semi-supervised node classification tasks.",

In this paper, we utilize graph patterns in a knowledge graph to overcome such problems. Our proposed model, graph pattern entity ranking Model (GRank), constructs an entity ranking system for each graph pattern and evaluate them using a measure for a ranking system. By doing so, we can find helpful graph patterns for predicting facts. Then we conduct the link prediction tasks on standard data sets to evaluate GRank. We show our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches such as ComplEx and TorusE on standard metrics such as HITS@n and MRR.

      "abstract": "Reasoning with knowledge graphs (KGs) has primarily focused on triple-shaped facts. Recent advancements have been explored to enhance the semantics of these facts by incorporating more potent representations, such as hyper-relational facts. However, these approaches are limited to atomic facts, which describe a single piece of information. This paper extends beyond atomic facts and delves into nested facts, represented by quoted triples where subjects and objects are triples themselves (e.g., ((BarackObama, holds_position, President), succeed_by, (DonaldTrump, holds_position, President))). These nested facts enable the expression of complex semantics like situations over time and logical patterns} over entities and relations. In response, we introduce NestE, a novel KG embedding approach that captures the semantics of both atomic and nested factual knowledge. NestE represents each atomic fact as a 1*3 matrix, and each nested relation is modeled as a 3*3 matrix that rotates the 1*3 atomic fact matrix through matrix multiplication. Each element of the matrix is represented as a complex number in the generalized 4D hypercomplex space, including (spherical) quaternions, hyperbolic quaternions, and split-quaternions. Through thorough analysis, we demonstrate the embedding's efficacy in capturing diverse logical patterns over nested facts, surpassing the confines of first-order logic-like expressions. Our experimental results showcase NestE's significant performance gains over current baselines in triple prediction and conditional link prediction.

      "abstract": "Answering complex logical queries over knowledge graphs (KGs) is a fundamental yet challenging task. Recently, query representation has been a mainstream approach to complex logical reasoning, making the target answer and query closer in the embedding space. However, there are still two limitations. First, prior methods model the query as a fixed vector, but ignore the uncertainty of relations on KGs. In fact, different relations may contain different semantic distributions. Second, traditional representation frameworks fail to capture the joint distribution of queries and answers, which can be learned by generative models that have the potential to produce more coherent answers. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a novel generative model, named DiffCLR, which exploits the diffusion model for complex logical reasoning to approximate query distributions. Specifically, we first devise a query transformation to convert logical queries into input sequences by dynamically constructing contextual subgraphs. Then, we integrate them into the diffusion model to execute a multi-step generative process, and a structure-enhanced self-attention is further designed for incorporating the structural features embodied in KGs. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show our model effectively outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in multi-hop chain queries with significant improvement.",

Recent some subgraph-based methods have shown some advancements, but they all overlook the relational semantics between entities during subgraph extraction. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel inductive link prediction model named SASILP (Structure and Semantic Inductive Link Prediction), which comprehensively incorporates relational semantics in both subgraph extraction and node initialization processes. The model employs a random walk strategy to calculate the structural scores of neighboring nodes and utilizes an enhanced graph attention network to determine their semantic scores. By integrating both structural and semantic scores, SASILP strategically selects key nodes to form a subgraph. Furthermore, the subgraph is initialized with a node initialization technique that integrates information about neighboring relations. The experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SASILP outperforms state-of-the-art methods on inductive link prediction tasks, and verify the effectiveness of our approach.",

For vascular robotic systems that assist clinical surgery, the development of autonomous guidewire delivery methods can reduce the learning curve and mental burden on doctors, as well as decrease surgical response time. However, current mainstream reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods suffer from a lack of interpretability and generalization, in addition to requiring long training periods. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method that constructs a fuzzy logic system based on the thought process of human doctors during clinical surgery when delivering the guidewire. The system calculates the rotational control parameters of the guidewire according to the relative angle of its distal end within the vascular system and historical attempt data, thereby enhancing the guidewire’s capability to navigate complex vascular branches. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the success rate and delivery efficiency in target point delivery tasks.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) aims to learn dense embeddings as the representations for entities and relations in KGs. Indeed, the entities in existing KGs suffer from the data imbalance issue, i.e., there exists a substantial disparity in the occurrence frequencies among various entities. Existing KGE models pre-define a unified and fixed dimension size for all entity embeddings. However, embedding sizes of entities are highly desired for their frequencies, while a uniform embedding size may result in inadequate expression of entities, i.e., leading to overfitting for low-frequency entities and underfitting for high-frequency ones. A straight-forward idea is to set the embedding sizes for each entity before KGE training. However, manually selecting different embedding sizes is labor-intensive and time-consuming, posing challenges in real-world applications. To tackle this problem, we propose AdaE, which adaptively learns KG embeddings with different embedding sizes during training. In particular, AdaE is capable of selecting appropriate dimension sizes for each entity from a continuous integer space. To this end, we specially tailor bilevel optimization for the KGE task, which alternately learns representations and embedding sizes of entities. Our framework is general and flexible, fitting various existing KGE models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and compatibility of AdaE.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) has proven to be an effective approach to solving the Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) task. Relational patterns which refer to relations with specific semantics exhibiting graph patterns are an important factor in the performance of KGE models. Though KGE models' capabilities are analyzed over different relational patterns in theory and a rough connection between better relational patterns modeling and better performance of KGC has been built, a comprehensive quantitative analysis on KGE models over relational patterns remains absent so it is uncertain how the theoretical support of KGE to a relational pattern contributes to the performance of triples associated to such a relational pattern. To address this challenge, we evaluate the performance of 7 KGE models over 4 common relational patterns on 2 benchmarks, then conduct an analysis in theory, entity frequency, and part-to-whole three aspects and get some counterintuitive conclusions. Finally, we introduce a training-free method Score-based Patterns Adaptation (SPA) to enhance KGE models' performance over various relational patterns. This approach is simple yet effective and can be applied to KGE models without additional training. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method generally enhances performance over specific relational patterns.

      "abstract": "Personalized review-based rating prediction aims at leveraging existing reviews to model user interests and item characteristics for rating prediction. Most of the existing studies mainly encounter two issues. First, the rich knowledge contained in the fine-grained aspects of each review and the knowledge graph is rarely considered to complement the pure text for better modeling user-item interactions. Second, the power of pre-trained language models is not carefully studied for personalized review-based rating prediction. To address these issues, we propose an approach named Knowledge-aware Collaborative Filtering with Pre-trained Language Model (KCF-PLM). For the first issue, to utilize rich knowledge, KCF-PLM develops a transformer network to model the interactions of the extracted aspects w.r.t. a user-item pair. For the second issue, to better represent users and items, KCF-PLM takes all the historical reviews of a user or an item as input to pre-trained language models. Moreover, KCF-PLM integrates the transformer network and the pre-trained language models through representation propagation on the knowledge graph and user-item guided attention of the aspect representations. Thus KCF-PLM combines review text, aspect, knowledge graph, and pre-trained language models together for review-based rating prediction. We conduct comprehensive experiments on several public datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of KCF-PLM.",

In order to deal with the situation, we propose the length reward in the Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework to represent the length of reasoning paths and use the neighbor information effectively. Our model utilizes the position information to design reward function. To solve this problem of save the semantic information of entity neighbors and historical trajectory information, we propose a new GRU-GAT framework to capture neighbor feature of the current entity and the target entity.

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) embeddings have shown great power in learning representations of entities and relations for link prediction tasks. Previous work usually embeds KGs into a single geometric space such as Euclidean space (zero curved), hyperbolic space (negatively curved) or hyperspherical space (positively curved) to maintain their specific geometric structures (e.g., chain, hierarchy and ring structures). However, the topological structure of KGs appears to be complicated, since it may contain multiple types of geometric structures simultaneously. Therefore, embedding KGs in a single space, no matter the Euclidean space, hyperbolic space or hyperspheric space, cannot capture the complex structures of KGs accurately. To overcome this challenge, we propose Geometry Interaction knowledge graph Embeddings (GIE), which learns spatial structures interactively between the Euclidean, hyperbolic and hyperspherical spaces. Theoretically, our proposed GIE can capture a richer set of relational information, model key inference patterns, and enable expressive semantic matching across entities. Experimental results on three well-established knowledge graph completion benchmarks show that our GIE achieves the state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Reasoning (KGR) aims to deduce missing or novel knowledge by learning structured information and semantic relationships within Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Despite significant advances achieved by deep neural networks in recent years, existing models typically extract non-linear representations from explicit features in a relatively simplistic manner and fail to fully exploit semantic heterogeneity of relation types and entity co-occurrence frequencies. Consequently, these models struggle to capture critical predictive cues embedded in various entities and relations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a relation aware spectral decoupling attention network for KGR (RASD). First, a spectral decoupling attention network module projects joint embeddings of entities and relations into the frequency domain, extracting features across different frequency bands and adaptively allocating attention at the global level to model frequency specific information. Next, a relation-aware learning module employs relation aware filters and an augmentation mechanism to preserve distinct relational properties and suppress redundant features, thereby enhancing representation of heterogeneous relations. Experimental results demonstrate that RASD achieves significant and consistent improvements over multiple leading baseline models on link prediction tasks across five public benchmark datasets.",

Most of the current algorithms consider a KG as a multidirectional labeled graph and lack the ability to capture the semantics underlying the schematic information. This position paper revises the state of the art and discusses several variations of the existing algorithms for KG completion, which are discussed progressively based on the level of expressivity of the semantics utilized. The paper begins with analysing various KG completion algorithms considering only factual information such as transductive and inductive link prediction and entity type prediction algorithms. It then revises the algorithms utilizing Large Language Models as background knowledge. Afterwards, it discusses the algorithms progressively utilizing semantic information such as class hierarchy information within the KGs and semantics represented in different description logic axioms. The paper concludes with a critical reflection on the current state of work in the community, where we argue that the aspects of semantics, rigorous evaluation protocols, and bias against external sources have not been sufficiently addressed in the literature, which hampers a more thorough understanding of advantages and limitations of existing approaches.

      "abstract": "In recent times, a plethora of hardware accelerators has emerged, catering to graph learning applications. However, the focus has primarily been on accelerating graph analysis, graph clustering, and graph mining, with a lack of attention to knowledge graph reasoning. Graph reasoning requires a more complex model to handle the complicated knowledge graph compared to other graph learning tasks. A primary knowledge graph reasoning task is to find the implicit relations between entities of a given knowledge graph, which demands a significantly longer training time than traditional graph learning algorithms due to the model complexity. Therefore, it is essential to develop an acceleration method to mitigate the training cost for the practical deployment of this task. Prior work in this field has solely considered using a single GPU or distributed GPU cluster to accelerate translational embedding models. However, as demonstrated in this paper, such general-purpose GPUs don't provide satisfactory results for more complex reinforcement learning-based models. Hence, it becomes necessary to design customized domain-specific accelerators. This work proposes GraFlex, the first domain specific accelerator for reinforcement learning-based knowledge graph reasoning, implemented on FPGA. We first develop a compression method for knowledge graphs. Then, we explore FPGAs of different sizes, analyze their on-chip resources, and suggest a mechanism to achieve high-speed training on devices with insufficient resources using the aforementioned compression method.",

      "abstract": "Graph machine learning has been extensively studied in both academia and industry. Although booming with a vast number of emerging methods and techniques, most of the literature is built on the in-distribution hypothesis, i.e., testing and training graph data are identically distributed. However, this in-distribution hypothesis can hardly be satisfied in many real-world graph scenarios where the model performance substantially degrades when there exist distribution shifts between testing and training graph data. To solve this critical problem, out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization on graphs, which goes beyond the in-distribution hypothesis, has made great progress and attracted ever-increasing attention from the research community. In this paper, we comprehensively survey OOD generalization on graphs and present a detailed review of recent advances in this area. First, we provide a formal problem definition of OOD generalization on graphs. Second, we categorize existing methods into three classes from conceptually different perspectives, i.e., data, model, and learning strategy, based on their positions in the graph machine learning pipeline, followed by detailed discussions for each category. We also review the theories related to OOD generalization on graphs and introduce the commonly used graph datasets for thorough evaluations. Finally, we share our insights on future research directions.",

      "title": "Knowledge Graph Embedding: An Overview",
      "abstract": "Many mathematical models have been leveraged to design embeddings for representing Knowledge Graph (KG) entities and relations for link prediction and many downstream tasks. These mathematically-inspired models are not only highly scalable for inference in large KGs, but also have many explainable advantages in modeling different relation patterns that can be validated through both formal proofs and empirical results. In this paper, we make a comprehensive overview of the current state of research in KG completion. In particular, we focus on two main branches of KG embedding (KGE) design: 1) distance-based methods and 2) semantic matching-based methods. We discover the connections between recently proposed models and present an underlying trend that might help researchers invent novel and more effective models. Next, we delve into CompoundE and CompoundE3D, which draw inspiration from 2D and 3D affine operations, respectively. They encompass a broad spectrum of techniques including distance-based and semantic-based methods. We will also discuss an emerging approach for KG completion which leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) and textual descriptions of entities and relations and offer insights into the integration of KGE embedding methods with PLMs for KG completion.",

      "abstract": "Deep Learning has become one of the most dominant approaches in Artificial Intelligence research today. Although conventional deep learning techniques have achieved huge successes on Euclidean data such as images, or sequence data such as text, there are many applications that are naturally or best represented with a graph structure. This gap has driven a tide in research for deep learning on graphs, among them Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the most successful in coping with various learning tasks across a large number of application domains. In this chapter, we will systematically organize the existing research of GNNs along three axes: foundations, frontiers, and applications. We will introduce the fundamental aspects of GNNs ranging from the popular models and their expressive powers, to the scalability, interpretability and robustness of GNNs. Then, we will discuss various frontier research, ranging from graph classification and link prediction, to graph generation and transformation, graph matching and graph structure learning. Based on them, we further summarize the basic procedures which exploit full use of various GNNs for a large number of applications. Finally, we provide the organization of our book and summarize the roadmap of the various research topics of GNNs.

      "abstract": "Sudden fire incidents have become one of the most frequent and common major disasters that threaten public safety and social development. The data released by authorities is mostly represented in text form, which provides limited and unclear descriptions of emergency response procedures. The low level of data structuring results in some data being unable to be effectively transformed into valuable information for reuse, leading to the wastage of data resources and hindering further processing as well as subsequent applications of case event information. In order to structure and process fire incident information, and enhance the value of information utilization for assisting decision-making, we focus on the fire incident data recorded in a state in the United States as the case data. Considering the characteristics of fire incident data, knowledge representation learning methods based on knowledge graphs such the TransE model and the TransH model are applied. By adopting the idea of distributed representation, the data is embedded into low-dimensional dense vectors, which can significantly improve computational efficiency, alleviate data sparsity issues, and meet the requirements of downstream applications. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed research method is validated by evaluating the embedding effects of the knowledge representation process using the evaluation metrics of link prediction tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that TransH significantly outperforms TransE on link prediction tasks.",

Therefore, our work first dives into this more realistic issue, lifelong TKG reasoning, where existing methods can only address part of the challenges. Specifically, we formulate lifelong TKG reasoning as a temporal-path-based reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Then, we add temporal displacement into the action space of RL to extrapolate for the future and further propose a temporal-rule-based reward shaping to guide the training. To transfer and update knowledge, we design a new edge-aware message passing module, where the embeddings of new entities and edges are inductive. We conduct extensive experiments on three newly constructed benchmarks for lifelong TKG reasoning. Experimental results show the outperforming effectiveness of our model against all well-adapted baselines.",

      "abstract": "Medical knowledge graph (KG) is sparse KG that contains insufficient information and missing paths. Multi-hop reasoning is an effective approach of medical KG completion, since it offers logical insights of the underlying KG and shows more direct interpretability. However, existing methods based on reinforcement learning focus on the use of historical and current state information but ignore the importance of evaluating the quality of candidate nodes in sparse KGs. Especially, it is difficult for the agent to select the correct search actions in sparse KGs. Occasionally, the agent will be at a dilemma state (i.e., state trap), where few actions can be selected. To address the above issue, we propose an effective relation-based node quality evaluation (RNQE) model for multi-hop reasoning. This model has two merits: (1) it reduces the impact of insufficient information in sparse KGs by synthesizing the reasoning quality information (i.e., the potential reasoning contribution) of candidate nodes; (2) it avoids the state trap by encouraging the agents to explore the path along a set of nodes with more relations. Experiments on both benchmark and real-world medical knowledge graphs demonstrate the promising ability of our proposed method to improve the reasoning performance for KGs.",

      "title": "Is Large Language Model Good at Triple Set Prediction? An Empirical Study",
      "abstract": "The core of the Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) task is to predict and complete the missing relations or nodes in a KG. Common KGC tasks are mostly about inferring unknown elements with one or two elements being known in a triple. In comparison, the Triple Set Prediction (TSP) task is a more realistic knowledge graph completion task. It aims to predict all elements of unknown triples based on the information from known triples. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited significant advancements in language comprehension, demonstrating considerable potential for KGC tasks. However, the potential of LLM on the TSP task has not yet to be investigated. Thus in this paper we proposed a new framework to explore the strengths and limitations of LLM in the TSP task. Specifically, the framework consists of LLM-based rule mining and LLM-based triple set prediction. The relation list of KG embedded within rich semantic information is first leveraged to prompt LLM in the generation of rules. This process is both efficient and independent of statistical information, making it easier to mine effective and realistic rules. For each subgraph, the specified rule is applied in conjunction with the relevant triples within that subgraph to guide the LLM in predicting the missing triples. Subsequently, the predictions from all subgraphs are consolidated to derive the complete set of predicted triples on KG. Finally, the method is evaluated on the relatively complete CFamily dataset. The experimental results indicate that when LLMs are required to adhere to a large amount of factual knowledge to predict missing triples, significant hallucinations occurs, leading to a noticeable decline in performance. To further explore the causes of this phenomenon, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis supported by a detailed case study. The datasets and code for experiments are available at https://github.com/zjukg/LLM-based-TSP.",

      "abstract": "Graph Neural Network (GNN), with the main idea of encoding graph structure information of graphs by propagation and aggregation, has developed rapidly. It achieved excellent performance in representation learning of multiple types of graphs such as homogeneous graphs, heterogeneous graphs, and more complex graphs like knowledge graphs. However, merely stacking GNN layers may not improve the model's performance and can even be detrimental. For the phenomenon of performance degradation in deep GNNs, we propose a new perspective. Unlike the popular explanations of over-smoothing or over-squashing, we think the issue arises from the interference of low-quality node representations during message propagation. We introduce a simple and general method, SF-GNN, to address this problem. In SF-GNN, we define two representations for each node, one is the node representation that represents the feature of the node itself, and the other is the message representation specifically for propagating messages to neighbor nodes. A self-filter module evaluates the quality of the node representation and decides whether to integrate it into the message propagation based on this quality assessment. Experiments on node classification tasks for both homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs, as well as link prediction tasks on knowledge graphs, demonstrate that our method can be applied to various GNN models and outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in addressing deep GNN degradation.",

However, existing deep neural networks and graph neural networks models are limited by their performance and parameters number, which can not capture global semantics and have poor generalization ability. Furthermore, existing methods employing large language model for entity relation extraction do not establish good relationships among multi-tasks of entity relation extraction task, resulting in more information can not be effectively shared and transmitted between tasks. In addition, previous approaches can not effectively eliminate false entities and relationships. To solve these problems, we propose an entity relation extraction framework based on large language model and multi-tasks iterative prompt engineering. In our model, we design an iterative prompt engineering, which can better establish the relationship among multi-tasks, and ensure every task to obtain the optimal results. Moreover, we design semantic merging, group disambiguation and self-verification modules to eliminate the false entity relations and noise nodes. Additionally, we design summary prompts to provide sufficient global semantics for better text segmentation. Finally, we evaluated our model on wikiann, wikineural, ACE2005, CoNLL2003, CoNLL2004, and SciERC datasets and compared it with other baseline models.",

At the same time, developments in the Internet of Things (IoT) have empowered modern industries to implement large-scale IoT ecosystems, such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Using knowledge graphs (KG) to process data from the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a research field worthy of attention, but most of the researched knowledge graph technologies are mainly concentrated in the field of static knowledge graphs, which are composed of triples. In fact, many graphs also contain some dynamic information, such as time changes at points and time changes at edges; such knowledge graphs are called Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs). We consider the temporal knowledge graph based on the projection and change of space. In order to combine the temporal information, we propose a new representation of the temporal knowledge graph, namely TBRm, which increases the temporal dimension of the translational distance model and utilizes relational predicates in time add representation in time dimension. We evaluate the proposed method on knowledge graph completion tasks using four benchmark datasets. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TBRm representation in the temporal dimension. At the same time, it is also practiced on a network security data set of the Industrial Internet of Things. The practical results prove that the TBRm method can achieve good performance in terms of the degree of harm to IIoT network security.",

      "abstract": "This study introduces a deep reinforcement learning-based graph convolutional neural network (DRL-GCN) for sugarcane leaf disease identification, which is important for improving agricultural yield and quality. The proposed method models the spatio-temporal relationships of sugarcane growth timing data and leaf spatial structure information and incorporates them into a graph convolutional neural network. A deep reinforcement learning strategy is combined with a modular design and feature fusion strategy to form the DRL-GCN model, which can handle noisy data and complex spatio-temporal patterns. First, by modeling sugarcane growth timing data and leaf spatial structure information, this study proposes an innovative method for representing spatio-temporal relationships. Then, the spatio-temporal relationship is incorporated into a graph convolutional neural network and combined with a deep reinforcement learning strategy to form a DRL-GCN model. The model uses a modular design and feature fusion strategy to accomplish the sugarcane leaf disease identification task. The experimental results from simulated and real sugarcane leaf images show that the DRL-GCN model has better recognition performance than traditional methods and other neural network models. The DRL-GCN model also shows high robustness and generalization ability when dealing with noisy data. This study offers an effective and high-performance solution for sugarcane disease recognition with wide application prospects.",

Certain embedding models — to contend with complex relationships (e.g., 1-to-N, N-to-1, N-to-N, etc.) — are utilized in a cascading fashion. Various negative sampling techniques are used at each major cascade, and this ensemble was explored against the Yet Another Great Ontology (YAGO)3-10 dataset. As the long-tail phenomenon is prevalent, with its concomitant unbalanced data (and bias towards favoring head classes), selected T2S2TKG Embedding (T2S2TKGE) techniques were utilized to better balance between head and tail classes. These were sorted into cascades based upon their performance against the various complex relationships, and their time as well as space complexities were considered as well. Various architectural constructs were explored, and a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)-“GraphSAGE”-inspired Graph-Attention-Network (GSGAT) mechanism along with a Robust Convex Relaxation (RCR)-based Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) (DCGAN)-DCNN-1,2,3 amalgam shows promise for operationalizing the aforementioned.",

      "abstract": "Predicting missing links has great significance in knowledge graph completion because it helps improve the accuracy and completeness of the information in the graph. The recent models employ an attention mechanism to capture the graph network. Previous attention-based models treat similar relation semantics for associated pairs of entities, but relations might have similar names but represent different semantics. Thus, models fail to capture the semantic dissimilarity of relations involved within the triplet entity pair. This paper proposes a new graph attention model capable of effectively learning embeddings by combining relationship features with triplet entity embeddings to balance relationship contributions while capturing meaningful graph structure. The model incorporates relational compositional embeddings to determine distinct attention for neighboring nodes during computation and update the entity embedding. This novel approach outperforms the previously established models on the benchmark dataset.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) such as Resource Description Framework (RDF) data represent relationships between various entities through the structure of triples (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$ < subject$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$predicate$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$object>$ </tex-math></inline-formula>). Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is crucial in machine learning applications, specifically in node classification and link prediction tasks. KGE remains a vital research topic within the semantic web community. RDF-star introduces the concept of a quoted triple (QT), a specific form of triple employed either as the subject or object within another triple. Moreover, RDF-star permits a QT to act as compositional entities within another QT, thereby enabling the representation of recursive, hyper-relational KGs with nested structures. However, existing KGE models fail to adequately learn the semantics of QTs and entities, primarily because they do not account for RDF-star graphs containing multi-leveled nested QTs and QT–QT relationships. This study introduces RDF-star2Vec, a novel KGE model specifically designed for RDF-star graphs. RDF-star2Vec introduces graph walk techniques that enable probabilistic transitions between a QT and its compositional entities. Feature vectors for QTs, entities, and relations are derived from generated sequences through the structured skip-gram model. Additionally, we provide a dataset and a benchmarking framework for data mining tasks focused on complex RDF-star graphs. Evaluative experiments demonstrated that RDF-star2Vec yielded superior performance compared to recent extensions of RDF2Vec in various tasks including classification, clustering, entity relatedness, and QT similarity.",

      "abstract": "The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) for domain applications in fields such as materials science and engineering depends on the development of fine-tuning strategies that adapt models for specialized, technical capabilities. In this work, we explore the effects of Continued Pretraining (CPT), Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and various preference-based optimization approaches, including Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO), on fine-tuned LLM performance. Our analysis shows how these strategies influence model outcomes and reveals that the merging of multiple fine-tuned models can lead to the emergence of capabilities that surpass the individual contributions of the parent models. We find that model merging leads to new functionalities that neither parent model could achieve alone, leading to improved performance in domain-specific assessments. Experiments with different model architectures are presented, including Llama 3.1 8B and Mistral 7B models, where similar behaviors are observed. Exploring whether the results hold also for much smaller models, we use a tiny LLM with 1.7 billion parameters and show that very small LLMs do not necessarily feature emergent capabilities under model merging, suggesting that model scaling may be a key component. In open-ended yet consistent chat conversations between a human and AI models, our assessment reveals detailed insights into how different model variants perform and show that the smallest model achieves a high intelligence score across key criteria including reasoning depth, creativity, clarity, and quantitative precision. Other experiments include the development of image generation prompts based on disparate biological material design concepts, to create new microstructures, architectural concepts, and urban design based on biological materials-inspired construction principles.",

Some of the parameters used to analyze the efficiency of an embedding are dilation, expansion, edge congestion and wirelength. If e = (u, v) ∈E (G), then the length of P f (e) in H is called the dilation of the edge e. The maximal dilation over all edges of G is called the dilation of the embedding f. The dilation of embedding G into H is the minimum dilation taken over all embeddings f of G into H. The edge congestion of an embedding f of G into H is the maximum number of edges of the graph G that are embedded on any single edge of H. Let EC f (e) denote the number of edges (u, v) of G such that e is in the path P f ((u, v)) between f (u) and f (v) in H. In other words, EC f (e) = ∈ ∈.

While these models focus on structural relationships, they often overlook valuable textual information found in literals, which can negatively impact performance. To address this limitation, we propose an approach leveraging Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to integrate textual knowledge into KGE learning. Our method uses knowledge distillation, where a PLM acts as a teacher to transfer semantic information to a target KGE model. By employing Sentence-BERT as the PLM, we evaluate the plausibility of textual facts and enhance the KGE model through a modified loss function incorporating Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. We introduce a trainable slack variable to regulate the influence of the PLM on the target model's semantic learning. Experiments on four KGE models across two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively enhances KGE models by incorporating missing semantics from textual knowledge.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs are useful for many AI tasks but often have missing facts. To populate the graphs, knowledge graph embedding models have been developed. TransE is one of such models and the first translation-based method. TransE is well known because the principle of TransE can effectively capture the rules of a knowledge graph although it seems very simple. However, TransE has problems with its regularization and an unchangeable ratio of negative sampling. In this paper, we generalize TransE to solve these problems by proposing knowledge graph embedding on a Lie group (KGLG) and the Weighted Negative Part (WNP) method for the objective function of translation-based models. KGLG is the novel translation-based method which embeds entities and relations of a knowledge graph on any Lie group. It allows us not to employ regularization during training of the model if we choose a compact lie group for the embedding space. The WNP method is for changing the ratio of negative sampling, which enhances translation-based models. Our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches such as TransE, DistMult, and ComplEx on a standard link prediction task. We show that TorusE, KGLG on a torus, is scalable to large-size knowledge graphs and faster than the original TransE.",

Second, various transition semantics in both one-hop and sequential transitions cannot be properly utilized to understand user movement trends. To overcome the above limitations, we introduce rotation operations in hyperbolic space, enabling the joint modeling of hierarchical structures and various transition semantics to effectively capture complex mobility patterns. Specifically, a novel hyperbolic rotation-based recommendation model HMST is developed for the next POI recommendation.

      "abstract": "At present, people are gradually becoming aware of financial management and thus fund recommendation attracts more and more attention to help them find suitable funds quickly. As a user usually takes many factors (e.g., fund theme, fund manager) into account when investing a fund and the fund usually consists of a substantial collection of investments, effectively modeling multi-interest representations is more crucial for personalized fund recommendation than the traditional goods recommendation. However, existing multi-interest methods are largely sub-optimal for fund recommendation, since they ignore financial domain knowledge and diverse fund investment intentions. In this work, we propose a Disentangled Interest importance aware Knowledge Graph Neural Network (DIKGNN) for personalized fund recommendation on FinTech platforms. In particular, we restrict the multiple intent spaces by introducing the attribute nodes from the fund knowledge graph as the minimum intent modeling unit to utilize financial domain knowledge and provide interpretability. In the intent space, we define disentangled intent representations, equipped with intent importance distributions to describe the diverse fund investment intentions. Then we design a new neighbor aggregation mechanism with the learned intent importance distribution upon the interaction graph and knowledge graph to collect multi-intent information. Furthermore, we leverage micro independence and macro balance constraints on the representations and distributions respectively to encourage intent independence and diversity. The extensive experiments on public recommendation benchmarks demonstrate that DIKGNN can achieve substantial improvement over state-of-the-art methods. Our proposed model is also evaluated over one real-world industrial fund dataset from a FinTech platform and has been deployed online.",

      "abstract": "To meet the challenge of incompleteness within Knowledge Graphs, Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) has emerged as the fundamental methodology for predicting the missing link (Link Prediction), by mapping entities and relations as low-dimensional vectors in continuous space. However, current KGE models often struggle with the polysemy issue, where entities exhibit different semantic characteristics depending on the relations in which they participate. Such limitation stems from weak interactions between entities and their relation contexts, leading to low expressiveness in modeling complex structures and resulting in inaccurate predictions. To address this, we propose Contextualized Quaternion Embedding (ConQuatE), a model that enhances the representation learning of entities across multiple semantic dimensions by leveraging quaternion rotation to capture diverse relational contexts. In specific, ConQuatE incorporates contextual cues from various connected relations to enrich the original entity representations. Notably, this is achieved through efficient vector transformations in quaternion space, without any extra information required other than original triples. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art models for Link Prediction on four widely recognized datasets: FB15k-237, WN18RR, FB15k, and WN18.",

One important recent innovation in Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain is the employ of deep neural models that make the most of pre-training, culminating in BERT, the most popular example of this line of approaches today. Recently, a series of new KGC methods introducing a pre-trained language model, such as KG-BERT, have been developed and released compelling performance. However, previous pre-training based KGC methods usually train the model by using simple training task and only utilize one-hop relational signals in KG, which leads that they cannot model high-order semantic contexts and multi-hop complex relatedness. To overcome this problem, this article presents a novel pre-training framework for KGC task, which especially consists of both one-hop relation level task (low-order) and multi-hop meta-graph level task (high-order). Hence, the proposed method can capture not only the elaborate sub-graph structure but also the subtle semantic information on the given KG.

      "title": "Paths2Pair: Meta-path Based Link Prediction in Billion-Scale Commercial Heterogeneous Graphs",
      "abstract": "Link prediction, determining if a relation exists between two entities, is an essential task in the analysis of heterogeneous graphs with diverse entities and relations. Despite extensive research in link prediction, most existing works focus on predicting the relation type between given pairs of entities. However, it is almost impractical to check every entity pair when trying to find most hidden relations in a billion-scale heterogeneous graph due to the billion squared number of possible pairs. Meanwhile, most methods aggregate information at the node level, potentially leading to the loss of direct connection information between the two nodes. In this paper, we introduce Paths2Pair, a novel framework to address these limitations for link prediction in billion-scale commercial heterogeneous graphs. (i) First, it selects a subset of reliable entity pairs for prediction based on relevant meta-paths. (ii) Then, it utilizes various types of content information from the meta-paths between each selected entity pair to predict whether a target relation exists. We first evaluate our Paths2Pair based on a large-scale dataset, and results show Paths2Pair outperforms state-of-the-art baselines significantly. We then deploy our Paths2Pair on JD Logistics, one of the largest logistics companies in the world, for business expansion. The uncovered relations by Paths2Pair have helped JD Logistics identify 108,709 contacts to attract new company customers, resulting in an 84% increase in the success rate compared to the state-of-the-practice solution, demonstrating the practical value of our framework. We have released the code of our framework at https://github.com/JQHang/Paths2Pair.",

      "abstract": "A key to knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is to choose a proper representation space, e.g., point-wise Euclidean space and complex vector space. In this paper, we propose a unified perspective of embedding and introduce uncertainty into KGE from the view of group theory. Our model can incorporate existing models (i.e., generality), ensure the computation is tractable (i.e., efficiency) and enjoy the expressive power of complex random variables (i.e., expressiveness). The core idea is that we embed entities/relations as elements of a symmetric group, i.e., permutations of a set. Permutations of different sets can reflect different properties of embedding. And the group operation of symmetric groups is easy to compute. In specific, we show that the embedding of many existing models, point vectors, can be seen as elements of a symmetric group. To reflect uncertainty, we first embed entities/relations as permutations of a set of random variables. A permutation can transform a simple random variable into a complex random variable for greater expressiveness, called a normalizing flow. We then define scoring functions by measuring the similarity of two normalizing flows, namely NFE. We construct several instantiating models and prove that they are able to learn logical rules. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of introducing uncertainty and our model. The code is available at https://github.com/changyi7231/NFE.",

      "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs), which effectively use topological structures in the knowledge graphs (KG) to embed entities and relations in low-dimensional spaces, have shown great power in knowledge graph completion (KGC). KG has abundant global and local structural information, however, many GNN-based KGC models cannot capture these two types of information about the graph structure by designing complex aggregation schemes, and are not designed well to learn representations of seen entities with sparse neighborhoods in isolated subgraphs. In this paper, we find that a simple attention-based method can outperform a general GNN-based approach for KGC. We then propose a double-branch multi-attention based graph neural network (MA-GNN) to learn more expressive entity representations which contain rich global-local structural information. Specifically, we first explore the graph attention network-based local aggregator to learn entity representations. Furthermore, we propose a snowball local attention mechanism by leveraging the semantic similarity between two-hop neighbors to enrich the entity embedding. Finally, we use Transformer-based self-attention to learn long-range dependence between entities to obtain richer representations with the global graph structure and entity features. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets show that MA-GNN achieves significant improvements over strong baselines for inductive KGC.",

Furthermore, many contrastive-based methods underutilize the rich semantic content in textual data. To address these issues, leveraging recent research in sentence representation learning and Chain of thought (CoT) in prompt engineering, we proposes a novel description-based KGC method with two-stage prompt-based template.

      "title": "Weighted Knowledge Graph Embedding",
      "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) aims to project both entities and relations in a knowledge graph (KG) into low-dimensional vectors. Indeed, existing KGs suffer from the data imbalance issue, i.e., entities and relations conform to a long-tail distribution, only a small portion of entities and relations occur frequently, while the vast majority of entities and relations only have a few training samples. Existing KGE methods assign equal weights to each entity and relation during the training process. Under this setting, long-tail entities and relations are not fully trained during training, leading to unreliable representations. In this paper, we propose WeightE, which attends differentially to different entities and relations. Specifically, WeightE is able to endow lower weights to frequent entities and relations, and higher weights to infrequent ones. In such manner, WeightE is capable of increasing the weights of long-tail entities and relations, and learning better representations for them. In particular, WeightE tailors bilevel optimization for the KGE task, where the inner level aims to learn reliable entity and relation embeddings, and the outer level attempts to assign appropriate weights for each entity and relation. Moreover, it is worth noting that our technique of applying weights to different entities and relations is general and flexible, which can be applied to a number of existing KGE models. Finally, we extensively validate the superiority of WeightE against various state-of-the-art baselines.",

We provide a generic recipe to construct embedding models associated with two instantiating examples: SO3E and SU2E, both of which apply a continuous non-Abelian group as the relation embedding. Empirical experiments using these two exampling models have shown state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.",

Specifically, we employ scientific publication and Crunchbase data to study highly-skilled migration, Twitter and Air Passenger data to investigate monthly trends. While main trends are preserved across datasets, with a general decrease in migration towards the UK immediately after the referendum approval, we are able to also observe more fine grained trends specific to some data or regions. Furthermore, we relate the changes in mobility observed from Air Passenger data with attention to Brexit from Google Trends data.",

As such, precise DDI prediction is vitally important. Several deep-learning approaches based on drug substructures have been proposed in recent years to predict DDI. However, these methods often struggle to generalize to unfamiliar domains, and their approaches to substructure extraction can be suboptimal. In this paper, we propose IS-DDI, a novel DDI prediction model based on invariant substructures. We employ a domain-invariant loss function to enhance generalization ability and adopt a Transformer-like substructure extraction module to obtain self-adaptive substructures effectively. We evaluate IS-DDI in both transductive and inductive setting. Experimental results demonstrate that IS-DDI not only has the advantage in prediction performance but also exhibits robust cross-domain generalization ability.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning on heterogeneous graphs has experienced rapid advancement in recent years, driven by the inherently heterogeneous nature of real-world data. However, existing studies typically assume the graphs to be static, while real-world graphs are continuously expanding. This dynamic nature requires models to adapt to new data while preserving existing knowledge. To this end, this work addresses the challenge of continual learning on heterogeneous graphs by introducing the Meta-learning based Knowledge Distillation framework (MKD), designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in evolving heterogeneous graph structures. MKD combines rapid task adaptation through meta-learning on limited samples with knowledge distillation to achieve an optimal balance between incorporating new information and maintaining existing knowledge. To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of sample selection, MKD incorporates a novel sampling strategy that selects a small number of target-type nodes based on node diversity and maintains fixed-size buffers for other types. The strategy retrieves first-order neighbors along metapaths and selects important neighbors based on their structural relevance, enabling the sampled subgraphs to retain key topological and semantic information. In addition, MKD introduces a semantic-level distillation module that aligns the attention distributions over different metapaths between teacher and student models, encouraging semantic consistency beyond the logit level. Comprehensive evaluations across three benchmark datasets validate MKD's effectiveness in handling continual learning scenarios on expanding heterogeneous graphs.",

      "abstract": "In Hong Kong, the number of elderly citizens will reach one-third of the population within the next decade. To mitigate this problem, timebanking has received attention in recent years. In timebanking, an NGO helper earns time credits through providing voluntary services (e.g., household duties) to elders. These time credits can be used to acquire other services. Although timebanking has shown the promise of promoting mutual care in many countries, its potential has not been fully utilized, due to the lack of IT and data support. We thus develop HINCare, a software platform that supports timebanking for multiple NGOs. Besides providing convenience to NGO supervisors, helpers, and elders, HINCare makes use of a heterogeneous information network (HIN) for recommending suitable helpers to elders. This is the first time a graph-based recommender system is used for such purposes. Currently, HINCare is used by 12 NGOs to serve more than 5000 users in Hong Kong. In this demonstration, participants can play the role of helpers and elders in the HINCare environment.",

      "abstract": "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the need for effective mechanisms to transform continuous multimodal data into discrete representations suitable for language-based processing. Discrete tokenization, with vector quantization (VQ) as a central approach, offers both computational efficiency and compatibility with LLM architectures. Despite its growing importance, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey that systematically examines VQ techniques in the context of LLM-based systems. This work fills this gap by presenting the first structured taxonomy and analysis of discrete tokenization methods designed for LLMs. We categorize 8 representative VQ variants that span classical and modern paradigms and analyze their algorithmic principles, training dynamics, and integration challenges with LLM pipelines. Beyond algorithm-level investigation, we discuss existing research in terms of classical applications without LLMs, LLM-based single-modality systems, and LLM-based multimodal systems, highlighting how quantization strategies influence alignment, reasoning, and generation performance. In addition, we identify key challenges including codebook collapse, unstable gradient estimation, and modality-specific encoding constraints. Finally, we discuss emerging research directions such as dynamic and task-adaptive quantization, unified tokenization frameworks, and biologically inspired codebook learning. This survey bridges the gap between traditional vector quantization and modern LLM applications, serving as a foundational reference for the development of efficient and generalizable multimodal systems.

This task encompasses the identification, within an aggregated knowledge graph, of nodes that are equivalent, more specific, or weakly related. In this article, we propose to match nodes within a knowledge graph by (i) learning node embeddings with Graph Convolutional Networks such that similar nodes have low distances in the embedding space, and (ii) clustering nodes based on their embeddings, in order to suggest alignment relations between nodes of a same cluster. We conducted experiments with this approach on the real world application of aligning knowledge in the field of pharmacogenomics, which motivated our study. We particularly investigated the interplay between domain knowledge and GCN models with the two following focuses. First, we applied inference rules associated with domain knowledge, independently or combined, before learning node embeddings, and we measured the improvements in matching results. Second, while our GCN model is agnostic to the exact alignment relations (e.g., equivalence, weak similarity), we observed that distances in the embedding space are coherent with the “strength” of these different relations (e.g., smaller distances for equivalences), letting us considering clustering and distances in the embedding space as a means to suggest alignment relations in our case study.",

      "abstract": "In the past few years, knowledge graphs (KGs), as a form of structured human intelligence, have attracted considerable research attention from academia and industry. In this very active field of study, a widely explored problem is that of link prediction, the task of predicting whether two nodes should be connected, based on node attributes and local or global graph connectivity properties. The state of the art in this area is represented by techniques based on graph embeddings. However, KGs, especially those acquired using automated or partly automated techniques, are often riddled with noise, e.g., wrong relationships, which makes the problem of link deletion as important as that of link prediction. In this paper, we address three main research questions. The first is about the true effectiveness of different knowledge graph embedding models under the presence of an increasing number of wrong links. The second is to asses if methods that can predict unknown relationships effectively, work equally well in recognizing incorrect relations. The third is to verify if there are systems robust enough to maintain primacy in all experimental conditions. To answer these research questions, we performed a systematic benchmark study in which the experimental setting includes ten state-of-the-art models, three common KG datasets with different structural properties and three downstream tasks: the widely explored tasks of link prediction and triple classification, and the less popular task of link deletion. Comparative studies often yield contradictory results, where the same systems score better or worse depending on the experimental context. In our work, in order to facilitate the discovery of clear performance patterns and their interpretation, we select and/or aggregate performance data to highlight each specific comparison dimension: dataset complexity, type of task, category of models, and robustness against noise.",

However, existing TKG approaches still face two main challenges, i.e., the limited capability to model arbitrary timestamps continuously and the lack of rich inference patterns under temporal constraints. In this paper, we propose an innovative TKGE method (PTBox) via polynomial decomposition-based temporal representation and box embedding-based entity representation to tackle the above-mentioned problems. Specifically, we decompose time information by polynomials and then enhance the model’s capability to represent arbitrary timestamps flexibly by incorporating the learnable temporal basis tensor. In addition, we model every entity as a hyperrectangle box and define each relation as a transformation on the head and tail entity boxes. The entity boxes can capture complex geometric structures and learn robust representations, improving the model’s inductive capability for rich inference patterns. Theoretically, our PTBox can encode arbitrary time information or even unseen timestamps while capturing rich inference patterns and higher-arity relations of the knowledge base. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

      "abstract": "The application of knowledge graph completion in industry and the Internet of Things involves various aspects, ranging from improving production efficiency to providing intelligent decision support. During the pursuit of constructing a knowledge graph, information for the graph is obtained from textual documents and online web pages. The extraction of information from documents is incomplete due to the limited information, so the knowledge graph needs to be completed. The knowledge graph completion model maps triples into different vector spaces for representation, but it still has the following shortcomings: 1) the textual encoder lacks of structured knowledge, 2) the distribution of relationships is long-tailed, with the model predominantly predicting more frequent relationships. In this paper, we propose structure-augment based long-tailed knowledge graph completion model (SALT-KGC) to deal with the two issues. To tackle the first problem, we partition each triple into two asymmetric parts as in translation-based graph embedding approach. We encode both parts using a Siamese-style textual encoder. Our model employs both classifier and spatial measurement for representation and structure learning respectively, in order to increase the structured knowledge of encoders. To tackle the second problem, we implement the focal loss to solve the problem of imbalance between positive and negative samples and focus on hard examples. Moreover, we develop a self-adaptive ensemble scheme to further improve the performance by incorporating from an existing graph embedding model. The SALT-KGC model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two widely-used public datasets.",

      "abstract": "Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) plays a pivotal role in knowledge graph completion or question answering systems, providing richer and more accurate triples and attributes. As numerical attributes become increasingly essential in characterizing entities and relations in KGs, the ability to reason over these attributes has gained significant importance. Existing graph-based methods such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs), primarily focus on aggregating homogeneous local neighbors and implicitly embedding diverse triples. However, these approaches often fail to fully leverage the potential of logical paths within the graph, limiting their effectiveness in exploiting the reasoning process. To address these limitations, we propose ChainsFormer, a novel chain-based framework designed to support numerical reasoning. Chainsformer not only explicitly constructs logical chains but also expands the reasoning depth to multiple hops. Specially, we introduces Relation-Attribute Chains (RA-Chains), a specialized logic chain, to model sequential reasoning patterns. ChainsFormer captures the step-by-step nature of multi-hop reasoning along RA-Chains by employing sequential in-context learning. To mitigate the impact of noisy chains, we propose a hyperbolic affinity scoring mechanism that selects relevant logic chains in a variable-resolution space. Furthermore, ChainsFormer incorporates an attention-based numerical reasoner to identify critical reasoning paths, enhancing both reasoning accuracy and transparency. Experimental results demonstrate that ChainsFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to a 20.0% improvement in performance.

It requires the agent to learn informative visual representations and robust navigation policy. To promote these two components, we proposed two complementary techniques, context-aware graph inference (CGI) and generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL). CGI improves visual representation learning by integrating object relationships, including category proximity and spatial correlation. It uses the translation on hyperplane (TransH) method to infer context-aware object relationships under the guidance of various contexts over navigation episodes, including image, action, and memory. Both CGI and GAIL aim to improve robust navigation policy, enabling the agent to escape from deadlock states, such as looping or getting stuck. GAIL is an imitation learning (IL) technique that enables the agent to learn from expert demonstrations. Specifically, we propose GAIL to address the non-discriminative reward problem that exists in object-goal navigation. GAIL designs a dynamic reward function and combines it with environment rewards, thus providing guidance for effective navigation policy. Experiments in the AI2-Thor and RoboThor environments demonstrate that our method significantly improves the effectiveness and efficiency of navigation in unfamiliar environments.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to infer missing facts from existing facts. Learning logical rules plays a pivotal role in KGC, as logical rules excel in explaining why a missing fact is inferred. Most existing rule learning methods focus merely on learning chain-like rules, neglecting type constraints on entities. In practice, type constraints are crucial in expressing precise rules. Therefore, we propose a novel formalism for logical rules named TC-rules, which complements chain-like rules with both explicit and implicit type constraints on entity variables. Accordingly, we propose an end-to-end approach to effectively learn TC-rules, by parameterizing a neural model to simulate the inference of TC-rules. Considering that existing end-to-end methods learn two different sets of logical rules to respectively answer a head query (?,rnew, t) and a tail query (h,rrnew, ?), leading to confusing explanations for supporting a new fact (h,rnew, t), we propose a bi-directional learning mechanism to ensure that the TC-rules learnt for answering (?,rnew, t) are the same as the TC-rules learnt for answering (h,rnew, ?). Experimental results on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art rule learners in both the link prediction task and the triple classification task. Furthermore, our case study confirms that expressive TC-rules can be extracted from the parameter assignment of the learnt neural model.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we explore a new way for user targeting, where non-expert marketers could select their target users solely given demands in natural language form. The key to this issue is how to transform natural languages into practical structured logical languages, i.e., the structured understanding of marketer demands. In practical scenarios, the demands of non-expert marketers are often abstract and diverse. Considering the impressive natural language processing ability of large language models (LLMs), we try to leverage LLMs to solve this issue. To stimulate the LLMs' reasoning ability, the chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting method is widely used, but existing methods still have some limitations in our scenario: (1) Previous methods either use simple \"Let's think step by step\" spells or provide fixed examples in demonstrations without considering compatibility between prompts and concrete questions, making LLMs ineffective when the marketers' demands are abstract and diverse. (2) Previous methods are often implemented in closed-source models or excessively large models, which is not suitable in industrial practical scenarios. Based on these, we propose ARALLM (i.e., Analogical Reasoning Augmented Large Language Models) consisting of two modules: Analogical Reasoning based Prompting and Reasoning-Augmented Multi-Task Model Distillation. Then, we adopt a retrieval-based method to conduct analogical reasoning with the help of the reasoning library. The experimental results show that this prompting strategy achieves better performance than the ordinary prompting method. Beyond that, we distill knowledge from super LLMs (GPT-3.5) to fine-tune smaller student LLMs in a multi-task training paradigm, enabling the models to be easily deployed in practical environments.

      "abstract": "Semantic networks, exemplified by the knowledge graph, serve as a means to represent knowledge by leveraging the structure of a graph. While the knowledge graph exhibits promising potential in the field of natural language processing, it suffers from incompleteness. This article focuses on the task of completing knowledge graphs by predicting linkages between entities, which is fundamental yet critical. Traditional methods based on translational distance struggle when dealing with unseen entities. In contrast, semantic matching presents itself as a potential solution due to its ability to handle such cases. However, semantic matching-based approaches necessitate large-scale datasets for effective training, which are typically unavailable in practical scenarios, hindering their competitive performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel architecture for knowledge graphs known as LP-BERT, which incorporates a language model. LP-BERT consists of two primary stages: multi-task pre-training and knowledge graph fine-tuning. During the pre-training phase, the model acquires relationship information from triples by predicting either entities or relations through three distinct tasks. In the fine-tuning phase, we introduce a batch-based triple-style negative sampling technique inspired by contrastive learning. This method significantly increases the proportion of negative sampling while maintaining a nearly unchanged training time. Furthermore, we propose a novel data augmentation approach that leverages the inverse relationship of triples to enhance both the performance and robustness of the model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we conduct extensive experiments on three widely used knowledge graph datasets: WN18RR, FB15k-237, and UMLS. The experimental results showcase the superiority of our methods, with LP-BERT achieving state-of-the-art performance on the WN18RR and FB15k-237 datasets.",

In order to solve this problem, this study proposes a multi-relationship semantic-aware knowledge graph completion method (MR-SAGCN), which enhances the expressive ability of knowledge triples and the generalization ability of the model by sensing the multi-layer semantic information between entities and the semantic information between relationships under different relationships, and adopting a multi-view decoder approach to enable the model to learn richer representations from different perspectives.

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is an efficient and scalable method for knowledge graph completion. However, most existing KGE methods suffer from the challenge of multiple relation semantics, which often degrades their performance. This is because most KGE methods learn fixed continuous vectors for entities (relations) and make deterministic entity predictions to complete the knowledge graph, which hardly captures multiple relation semantics. To tackle this issue, previous works try to learn complex probabilistic embeddings instead of fixed embeddings but suffer from heavy computational complexity. In contrast, this paper proposes a simple yet efficient framework namely the Knowledge Graph Diffusion Model (KGDM) to capture the multiple relation semantics in prediction. Its key idea is to cast the problem of entity prediction into conditional entity generation. Specifically, KGDM estimates the probabilistic distribution of target entities in prediction through Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). To bridge the gap between continuous diffusion models and discrete KGs, two learnable embedding functions are defined to map entities and relation to continuous vectors. To consider connectivity patterns of KGs, a Conditional Entity Denoiser model is introduced to generate target entities conditioned on given entities and relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KGDM significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in three benchmark datasets.",

      "abstract": "Due to the open world assumption, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are never complete. In order to address this issue, various Link Prediction (LP) methods are proposed so far. Some of these methods are inductive LP models which are capable of learning representations for entities not seen during training. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing inductive LP models focus on learning representations for unseen relations. In this work, a novel Relation Aware Inductive Link preDiction (RAILD) is proposed for KG completion which learns representations for both unseen entities and unseen relations. In addition to leveraging textual literals associated with both entities and relations by employing language models, RAILD also introduces a novel graph-based approach to generate features for relations. Experiments are conducted with different existing and newly created challenging benchmark datasets and the results indicate that RAILD leads to performance improvement over the state-of-the-art models. Moreover, since there are no existing inductive LP models which learn representations for unseen relations, we have created our own baselines and the results obtained with RAILD also outperform these baselines.",

      "abstract": "Zero-Shot Relational Learning (ZSRL), strives to predict relations that have not been observed during training, presenting a considerable challenge in terms of model generalization. Existing ZSRL methods usually utilize the prior knowledge of labels (e.g., text description, ontological schema) to enable knowledge transfer by learned features. Nonetheless, these methods remain limited to calculating the surface features exhibited by relations, failing to fully explore their underlying driving factors. This leads to insufficient discrimination between the shared and distinctive inherent components among relations, which consequently impedes the cognitive understanding required for advanced reasoning. In our study, we aim to identify and utilize shared factors that widely exist in the prior knowledge of classes to learn enhanced semantic representations via shared factors composition, and develop our Factor-based ZSRL framework (FZR) with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to bridge inequality between seen and unseen classes. FZR is designed to restructure the semantic space in such a way that it captures the essence of relation formation, thereby facilitating superior knowledge transfer in zero-shot scenarios. We conduct extensive experiments and evaluate our model on real-world datasets, and the results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in zero-shot relational learning tasks.",

      "abstract": "Recent advent of deep learning techniques have reinforced the development of new recommender systems. Although these systems have been demonstrated as efficient and effective, the issue of item popularity bias in these recommender systems has raised serious concerns. While most of the existing works focus on group fairness at item side, individual fairness at item side is left largely unexplored. To address this issue, in this paper, first, we define a new notion of individual fairness from the perspective of items, namely (α, β)-fairness, to deal with item popularity bias in recommendations. In particular, (α, β)-fairness requires that similar items should receive similar coverage in the recommendations, where α and β control item similarity and coverage similarity respectively, and both item and coverage similarity metrics are defined as task specific for deep recommender systems. Next, we design two bias mitigation methods, namely embedding-based re-ranking (ER) and greedy substitution (GS), for deep recommender systems. ER is an in-processing mitigation method that equips (α, β)-fairness as a constraint to the objective function of the recommendation algorithm, while GS is a post-processing approach that accepts the biased recommendations as the input, and substitutes high-coverage items with low-coverage ones in the recommendations to satisfy (α, β)-fairness. We evaluate the performance of both mitigation algorithms on two real-world datasets and a set of state-of-the-art deep recommender systems. Our results demonstrate that both ER and GS outperform the existing minimum-coverage (MC) mitigation solutions [Koutsopoulos and Halkidi 2018; Patro et al. 2020] in terms of both fairness and accuracy of recommendations. Furthermore, ER delivers the best trade-off between fairness and recommendation accuracy among a set of alternative mitigation methods, including GS, the hybrid of ER and GS, and the existing MC solutions.",

      "abstract": "Numerical reasoning is an essential task for supporting machine learning applications, such as recommendation and information retrieval. The reasoning task aims to compare two items and infer new facts (e.g., is taller than) by leveraging existing relational information and numerical attributes (e.g., the height of an entity) in knowledge graphs. However, most existing methods rely on leveraging attribute encoders or additional loss functions to predict numerical relations. Therefore, the prediction performance is often not robust in cases when attributes are sparsely observed. In this paper, we propose a Relation-AAware attribute representation learning-based Knowledge Graph Embedding method for numerical reasoning tasks, which we call RAKGE. RAKGE incorporates a newly proposed attribute representation learning mechanism, which can leverage the association between relations and their corresponding numerical attributes. In addition, we introduce a robust self-supervised learning method to generate unseen positive and negative examples, thereby making our approach more reliable when numerical attributes are sparsely available. In the evaluation of three real-world datasets, our proposed model outperformed state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of up to 65.1% in Hits@1 and up to 52.6% in MRR compared to the best competitor.

      "abstract": "The design of alloys is a multi-scale problem that requires a holistic approach that involves retrieving relevant knowledge, applying advanced computational methods, conducting experimental validations, and analyzing the results, a process that is typically reserved for human experts. Machine learning (ML) can help accelerate this process, for instance, through the use of deep surrogate models that connect structural features to material properties, or vice versa. However, existing data-driven models often target specific material objectives, offering limited flexibility to integrate out-of-domain knowledge and cannot adapt to new, unforeseen challenges. Here, we overcome these limitations by leveraging the distinct capabilities of multiple AI agents that collaborate autonomously within a dynamic environment to solve complex materials design tasks. The proposed physics-aware generative AI platform, AtomAgents, synergizes the intelligence of large language models (LLM) the dynamic collaboration among AI agents with expertise in various domains, including knowledge retrieval, multi-modal data integration, physics-based simulations, and comprehensive results analysis across modalities that includes numerical data and images of physical simulation results. The concerted effort of the multi-agent system allows for addressing complex materials design problems, as demonstrated by examples that include autonomously designing metallic alloys with enhanced properties compared to their pure counterparts. Our results enable accurate prediction of key characteristics across alloys and highlight the crucial role of solid solution alloying to steer the development of advanced metallic alloys. Our framework enhances the efficiency of complex multi-objective design tasks and opens new avenues in fields such as biomedical materials engineering, renewable energy, and environmental sustainability.",

      "abstract": "A vast amount of textual and structural information is required for knowledge graph construction and its downstream tasks. However, most of the current knowledge graphs are incomplete due to the difficulty of knowledge acquisition and integration. Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) is used to predict missing connections. In previous studies, textual information and graph structural information are utilized independently, without an effective method for fusing these two types of information. In this paper, we propose a graph structure enhanced pre-training language model for knowledge graph completion. Firstly, we design a graph sampling algorithm and a Graph2Seq module for constructing sub-graphs and their corresponding contexts to support large-scale knowledge graph learning and parallel training. It is also the basis for fusing textual data and graph structure. Next, two pre-training tasks based on masked modeling are designed for capturing accurate entity-level and relation-level information. Furthermore, this paper proposes a novel asymmetric Encoder-Decoder architecture to restore masked components, where the encoder is a Pre-trained Language Model (PLM) and the decoder is a multi-relational Graph Neural Network (GNN). The purpose of the architecture is to integrate textual information effectively with graph structural information. Finally, the model is fine-tuned for KGC tasks on two widely used public datasets. The experiments show that the model achieves excellent performance and outperforms baselines in most metrics, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by fusing the structure and semantic information to knowledge graph.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Predicting interactions between microbes and hosts plays critical roles in microbiome population genetics and microbial ecology and evolution. How to systematically characterize the sophisticated mechanisms and signal interplay between microbes and hosts is a significant challenge for global health risks. Identifying microbe-host interactions (MHIs) can not only provide helpful insights into their fundamental regulatory mechanisms, but also facilitate the development of targeted therapies for microbial infections. In recent years, computational methods have become an appealing alternative due to the high risk and cost of wet-lab experiments. Therefore, in this study, we utilized rich microbial metagenomic information to construct a novel heterogeneous microbial network (HMN)-based model named KGVHI to predict candidate microbes for target hosts. Specifically, KGVHI first built a HMN by integrating human proteins, viruses and pathogenic bacteria with their biological attributes. Then KGVHI adopted a knowledge graph embedding strategy to capture the global topological structure information of the whole network. A natural language processing algorithm is used to extract the local biological attribute information from the nodes in HMN. Finally, we combined the local and global information and fed it into a blended deep neural network (DNN) for training and prediction. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, the comprehensive experimental results show that our model can obtain excellent results on the corresponding three MHI datasets. Furthermore, we also conducted two pathogenic bacteria case studies to further indicate that KGVHI has excellent predictive capabilities for potential MHI pairs.",

However, the existing patent analysis method always focus on the patent text cues, and such a strategy merely depends on the feature information to capture the data characteristics, failing to multi-type informative patent representation. Therefore, in this paper, to model the underlying structure/relationships of patent data, we employ the knowledge graph to depict the heterogeneous attributes of patent, and propose a novel Knowledge Graph-based Patent Clustering (KGPC) method, where the relationship reconstruction in knowledge graph as well as clustering-oriented representation refinement for patent clustering are jointly considered. With this model, there are three components, i.e., entity representation refinement, relationship reconstruction and self-supervised entity clustering. Given a patent knowledge graph as input, the entity representation refinement can be mutually boosted by the relationship reconstruction and self-supervised clustering objective, thereby leading to a balanced clustering-oriented output. Extensive experiments on several real-world patent knowledge graph datasets validate the effectiveness of KGPC while compared with the state-of-the-art.",

      "abstract": "Embedding methods have become popular due to their scalability on link prediction and/or triple classification tasks on Knowledge Graphs. Embedding models are trained relying on both positive and negative samples of triples. However, in the absence of negative assertions, these must be usually artificially generated using various negative sampling strategies, ranging from random corruption to more sophisticated techniques which have an impact on the overall performance. Most of the popular libraries for knowledge graph embedding, support only basic such strategies and lack advanced solutions. To address this gap, we deliver an extension for the popular KGE framework PyKEEN that integrates a suite of several advanced negative samplers (including both static and dynamic corruption strategies), within a consistent modular architecture, to generate meaningful negative samples, while remaining compatible with existing PyKEEN -based workflows and pipelines. The developed extension not only enhancesPyKEEN itself but also allows for easier and comprehensive development of embedding methods and/or for their customization. As a proof of concept, we present a comprehensive empirical study of the developed extensions and their impact on the performance (link prediction tasks) of different embedding methods, which also provides useful insights for the design of more effective strategies",

However, a notable challenge arises as mobile users often hesitate to disclose their personal interests, requirements, and locations to service providers in location-based publish/subscribe systems, giving rise to substantial data privacy concerns. In this light, we propose a privacy-preserving publish/subscribe framework, which not only facilitates real-time delivery of geo-textual objects to a large-scale audience of location-based subscribers, but also ensures the utmost privacy of subscribers’ locations and query keywords.

      "abstract": "Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) reasoning involves predicting future events based on historical information. However, due to the unpredictability of future events, this task is highly challenging. To address this issue, we propose a multi-scale hybrid architecture model based on ensemble learning, called RLGNet (Repeating-Local-Global History Network). Inspired by the application of multi-scale information in other fields, we introduce the concept of multi-scale information into TKG reasoning. Specifically, RLGNet captures and integrates different levels of historical information by combining modules that process information at various scales. The model comprises three modules: the Repeating History Module focuses on identifying repetitive patterns and trends in historical data, the Local History Module captures short-term changes and details, and the Global History Module provides a macro perspective on long-term changes. Additionally, to address the limitations of previous single-architecture models in generalizing across single-step and multi-step reasoning tasks, we adopted architectures based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) for the Local and Global History Modules, respectively. This hybrid architecture design enables the model to complement both multi-step and single-step reasoning capabilities. Finally, to address the issue of noise in TKGs, we adopt an ensemble learning strategy, combining the predictions of the three modules to reduce the impact of noise on the final prediction results. RLGNet achieves better performance than the baseline models.",

Explaining the results of this task means finding a meaningful reason for which entities are predicted as linked. This work presents a structural and semantically enriched approach for generating explanations for link predictions, by exploring the data available in the knowledge graph. The solution searches for paths and examples of similar situations that justify the prediction carried out using numerical approaches.

      "abstract": "The use of different techniques and tools is a common practice to cover all stages in the development life-cycle of systems generating a significant number of work products. These artefacts are frequently encoded using diverse formats, and often require access through non-standard protocols and formats. In this context, Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) emerges as a methodology to shift the paradigm of Systems Engineering practice from a document-oriented environment to a model-intensive environment. To achieve this major goal, a formalised application of modelling is employed throughout the life-cycle of systems to generate various system artefacts represented as models, such as requirements, logical models, and multi-physics models. However, the mere use of models does not guarantee one of the main challenges in the Systems Engineering discipline, namely, the reuse of system artefacts. Considering the fact that models are becoming the main type of system artefact, it is necessary to provide the capability to properly and efficiently represent and retrieve the generated models. In light of this, traditional information retrieval techniques have been widely studied to match existing software assets according to a set of capabilities or restrictions. However, there is much more at stake than the simple retrieval of models or even any piece of knowledge. An environment for model reuse must provide the proper mechanisms to (1) represent any piece of data, information, or knowledge under a common and shared data model, and (2) provide advanced retrieval mechanisms to elevate the meaning of information resources from text-based descriptions to concept-based ones. This need has led to novel methods using word embeddings and vector-based representations to semantically encode information. Such methods are applied to encode the information of physical models while preserving their underlying semantics. In this study, a text corpus from MATLAB Simulink models was preprocessed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and trained to generate word vector representations. Then, the presented method was validated using a testbed of MATLAB Simulink physical models in which verbalisations of models are transformed into vectors. The effectiveness of the proposed solution was assessed through a use case study. Evaluation of the results demonstrates a precision value of 0.925, a recall value of 0.865, and an F1 score of 0.884.",

      "abstract": "Recently, an enormous amount of research has emerged on multimodal knowledge graph completion (MKGC), which seeks to extract knowledge from multimodal data and predict the most plausible missing facts to complete a given multimodal knowledge graph (MKG). However, existing MKGC approaches largely ignore that visual information may introduce noise and lead to uncertainty when adding them to the traditional KG embeddings due to the contribution of each associated image to entity is different in diverse link scenarios. Moreover, treating each triple independently when learning entity embeddings leads to local structural and the whole graph information missing. To address these challenges, we propose a novel link aware fusion and aggregation based multimodal knowledge graph completion model named LAFA, which is composed of link aware fusion module and link aware aggregation module. The link aware fusion module alleviates noise of irrelevant visual information by calculating the importance between an entity and its associated images in different link scenarios, and fuses the visual and structural embeddings according to the importance through our proposed modality embedding fusion mechanism. The link aware aggregation module assigns neighbor structural information to a given central entity by calculating the importance between the entity and its neighbors, and aggregating the fused embeddings through linear combination according to the importance. Extensive experiments on standard datasets validate that LAFA can obtain state-of-the-art performance.",

Results show that RETA-Filter can efficiently reduce the solution space for the instance completion task, outperforming best baseline techniques by 10.61%–84.75% on the reduced solution space size, while also being 1.7×–29.6x faster than these techniques. Moreover, RETA-Grader trained on the reduced solution space also significantly outperforms the best state-of-the-art techniques on the instance completion task by 31.90%–105.02%.",

      "abstract": "Incorporating knowledge graphs as auxiliary information to enhance recommendation systems can improve the representations learning of users and items. Recommendation methods based on knowledge graphs can introduce user–item interaction learning into the item graph, focusing only on learning the node vector representations within a single graph; alternatively, they can treat user–item interactions and item graphs as two separate graphs and learn from each graph individually. Learning from two graphs has natural advantages in exploring original information and interaction information, but faces two main challenges: (1) in complex graph connection scenarios, how to adequately mine the self-information of each graph, and (2) how to merge interaction information from the two graphs while ensuring that user–item interaction information predominates. Existing methods do not thoroughly explore the simultaneous mining of self-information from both graphs and effective interaction information, leading to the loss of valuable insights. Considering the success of contrastive learning in mining self-information and auxiliary information, this paper proposes a dual-graph contrastive learning recommendation method based on knowledge graphs (KGDC) to explore a more accurate representations of users and items in recommendation systems based on external knowledge graphs. In the learning process within the self-graph, KGDC strengthens and represents the information of different connecting edges in both graphs, and extracts the existing information more fully. In interactive information learning, KGDC reinforces the interaction relationship between users and items in the external knowledge graph, realizing the leading role of the main task. We conducted a series of experiments on three standard datasets, and the results show that the proposed method can achieve better results.",

AI techniques have not only greatly developed within their native areas of development but have also spread in terms of their application to multiple areas of science and technology. We conduct a large-scale analysis of AI in science. The first question we address is the composition of what is commonly labeled AI, and how the various subfields within this domain are linked together. We reconstruct the internal structure of the AI ecosystem through the co-occurrence of AI terms in publications, and we distinguish between 15 different specialties of AI. Furthermore, we investigate the spreading of AI outside its native disciplines. We bring to light the dynamics of the diffusion of AI in the scientific ecosystem and we describe the disciplinary landscape of AI applications. Finally we analyze the role of collaborations for the interdisciplinary spreading of AI. Although the study of science frequently emphasizes the openness of scientific communities, we show that collaborations between those scholars who primarily develop AI and those who apply it are quite rare. Only a small group of researchers can gradually establish bridges between these communities.",

To address this challenge, we developed TarIKGC, a tool for target prioritization that leverages semantics enhanced knowledge graph (KG) completion. This method harnesses knowledge representation learning within a heterogeneous compound-target-disease network. Specifically, TarIKGC combines an attention-based aggregation graph neural network with a multimodal feature extractor network to simultaneously learn internal semantic features from biomedical entities and topological features from the KG. Furthermore, a KG embedding model is employed to identify missing relationships among compounds and targets. In silico evaluations highlighted the superior performance of TarIKGC in drug repositioning tasks. In addition, TarIKGC successfully identified two potential cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) inhibitors with novel scaffolds through reverse target fishing. Both compounds exhibited antiproliferative activities across multiple therapeutic indications targeting CDK2.",

      "abstract": "Relation prediction is a task designed for knowledge graph completion which aims to predict missing relationships between entities. Recent subgraph-based models for inductive relation prediction have received increasing attention, which can predict relation for unseen entities based on the extracted subgraph surrounding the candidate triplet. However, they are not completely inductive because of their disability of predicting unseen relations. Moreover, they fail to pay sufficient attention to the role of relation as they only depend on the model to learn parameterized relation embedding, which leads to inaccurate prediction on long-tail relations. In this paper, we introduce Relation-dependent Contrastive Learning (ReCoLe) for inductive relation prediction, which adapts contrastive learning with a novel sampling method based on clustering algorithm to enhance the role of relation and improve the generalization ability to unseen relations. Instead of directly learning embedding for relations, ReCoLe allocates a pre-trained GNN-based encoder to each relation to strengthen the influence of relation. The GNN-based encoder is optimized by contrastive learning, which ensures satisfactory performance on long-tail relations. In addition, the cluster sampling method equips ReCoLe with the ability to handle both unseen relations and entities. Experimental results suggest that ReCoLe outperforms state-of-the-art methods on commonly used inductive datasets.",

Recently, embedding methods have been used for entity alignment tasks, that learn a vector-space representation of entities which preserves their similarity in the original KGs. A wide variety of supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised methods have been proposed that exploit both factual (attribute based) and structural information (relation based) of entities in the KGs. Still, a quantitative assessment of their strengths and weaknesses in real-world KGs according to different performance metrics and KG characteristics is missing from the literature. In this work, we conduct the first meta-level analysis of popular embedding methods for entity alignment, based on a statistically sound methodology. Our analysis reveals statistically significant correlations of different embedding methods with various meta-features extracted by KGs and rank them in a statistically significant way according to their effectiveness across all real-world KGs of our testbed. Finally, we study interesting trade-offs in terms of methods’ effectiveness and efficiency.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph, a typical multi-relational structure, includes large-scale facts of the world, yet it is still far away from completeness. Knowledge graph embedding, as a representation method, constructs a low-dimensional and continuous space to describe the latent semantic information and predict the missing facts. Among various solutions, almost all embedding models have high time and memory-space complexities and, hence, are difficult to apply to large-scale knowledge graphs. Some other embedding models, such as TransE and DistMult, although with lower complexity, ignore inherent features and only use correlations between different entities to represent the features of each entity. To overcome these shortcomings, we present a novel low-complexity embedding model, namely, SimE-ER, to calculate the similarity of entities in independent and associated spaces. In SimE-ER, each entity (relation) is described as two parts. The entity (relation) features in independent space are represented by the features entity (relation) intrinsically owns and, in associated space, the entity (relation) features are expressed by the entity (relation) features they connect. And the similarity between the embeddings of the same entities in different representation spaces is high. In experiments, we evaluate our model with two typical tasks: entity prediction and relation prediction. Compared with the state-of-the-art models, our experimental results demonstrate that SimE-ER outperforms existing competitors and has low time and memory-space complexities.",

This framework is based on three components: (1) multimodal KGEs, (2) a blocking procedure, and finally, (3) hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two newly created KGs: (i) KG containing information from Scientometrics Journal from 1978 onwards (OC-782K), and (ii) a KG extracted from a well-known benchmark for AND provided by AMiner (AMiner-534K). The results show that our proposed architecture outperforms our baselines of 8–14% in terms of F1 score and shows competitive performances on a challenging benchmark such as AMiner.

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph reasoning is a key task in the field of natural language processing, aiming to infer missing entities or relations through existing information in the graph. Multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning has been one of the hot topics in knowledge graph research in recent years. However, due to the inherent incompleteness of knowledge graphs, effectively completing knowledge graphs has become a challenge. Multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning provides an interpretable solution by predicting missing links through exploring paths between entities. Most previous works have used reinforcement learning (RL) based methods to learn paths towards target entities. However, these methods may lack the ability to capture long-distance dependencies between entities, and they may fail to infer a path when there are missing edges along the path. To address these issues, we propose a multi-hop reasoning model based on sequence-to-sequence Transformer model named MHKGR. We introduce two modeling improvements to address the above problems: (1) we introduce a position-aware attention mechanism, which allows the model to flexibly focus on entities on different paths during the reasoning process, thereby improving the accuracy of multi-hop reasoning paths; (2) we optimize the output distribution of the model when generating reasoning paths by introducing a global response normalization module, which reduces noise and interference from irrelevant paths, enhancing the model’s ability to identify correct reasoning paths. We conducted extensive experiments on multiple standard and sparse knowledge graph datasets, and the results show that our method outperforms previous methods significantly.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models have excelled at encoding and leveraging language patterns in large text-based corpora for various tasks, including spatiotemporal event-based question answering (QA). However, due to encoding a text-based projection of the world, they have also been shown to lack a full bodied understanding of such events, e.g., a sense of intuitive physics, and cause-and-effect relationships among events. In this work, we propose using causal event graphs (CEGs) to enhance language understanding of spatiotemporal events in language models, using a novel approach that also provides proofs for the model’s capture of the CEGs. A CEG consists of events denoted by nodes, and edges that denote cause and effect relationships among the events. We perform experimentation and evaluation of our approach for benchmark spatiotemporal QA tasks and show effective performance, both quantitative and qualitative, over state-of-the-art baseline methods.",

      "abstract": "In dynamic Windows malware detection, deep learning models are extensively deployed to analyze API sequences. Methods based on API sequences play a crucial role in malware prevention. However, due to the continuous updates of APIs and the changes in API sequence calls leading to the constant evolution of malware variants, the detection capability of API sequence-based malware detection models significantly diminishes over time. We observe that the API sequences of malware samples before and after evolution usually have similar malicious semantics. Specifically, compared to the original samples, evolved malware samples often use the API sequences of the pre-evolution samples to achieve similar malicious behaviors. For instance, they access similar sensitive system resources and extend new malicious functions based on the original functionalities. In this paper, we propose a frame(MME), a framework that can enhance existing API sequence-based malware detectors and mitigate the adverse effects of malware evolution. To help detection models capture the similar semantics of these post-evolution API sequences, our framework represents API sequences using API knowledge graphs and system resource encodings and applies contrastive learning to enhance the model's encoder. Results indicate that, compared to Regular Text-CNN, our framework can significantly reduce the false positive rate by 13.10% and improve the F1-Score by 8.47% on five years of data, achieving the best experimental results. Additionally, evaluations show that our framework can save on the human costs required for model maintenance. We only need 1% of the budget per month to reduce the false positive rate by 11.16% and improve the F1-Score by 6.44%.",

However, there is no research on leveraging path-based GNNs to promote the more general case of KGs, namely hyper-relational KGs (HKGs). To bridge this research gap, we study the path-based GNNs and discover that existing path-based GNNs fail to handle HKGs because they cannot well explore the external information (i.e., qualifiers) stored in HKGs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Hyper Path-based Graph Neural Network (HyperPGNN) for HKGs. Specifically, we propose a novel Hyper2Tri conversion and hyper query learner to better enable the path-based GNNs to understand qualifiers in HKG, and then capture them into the graph learning.

In this article, we provide a systematic review of existing KGE techniques based on representation spaces. Particularly, we build a fine-grained classification to categorise the models based on three mathematical perspectives of the representation spaces: (1) algebraic perspective, (2) geometric perspective and (3) analytical perspective. We introduce the rigorous definitions of fundamental mathematical spaces before diving into KGE models and their mathematical properties. We further discuss different KGE methods over the three categories, as well as summarise how spatial advantages work over different embedding needs. By collating the experimental results from downstream tasks, we also explore the advantages of mathematical space in different scenarios and the reasons behind them. We further state some promising research directions from a representation space perspective, with which we hope to inspire researchers to design their KGE models as well as their related applications with more consideration of their mathematical space properties.",

Yet, despite the intensive research on KRL, most existing studies either focus on homogenous KGs or assume KG completion tasks ( i.e. , inference of missing facts), while answering complex logical queries over KGs with multiple aspects (multi-view KGs) remains an open challenge.Tobridge this gap, in this paper, we present R O MA 1 , a novel KRL framework for answering logical queries over multi-view KGs. Compared with the prior work, R O MA departs in major aspects. (i) It models a multi-view KG as a set of overlaying sub-KGs, each corresponding to one view, which subsumes many types of KGs studied in the literature ( e.g. , temporal KGs). (ii) It supports complex logical queries with varying relation and view constraints ( e.g. , with complex topology and/or from multiple views); (iii) It scales up to KGs of large sizes ( e.g. , millions of facts) and ﬁne-granular views ( e.g. , dozens of views); (iv) It generalizes to query structures and KG views that are unobserved during training. Extensive empirical evaluation on real-world KGs shows that R O MA signiﬁcantly outperforms alternative methods.",

      "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of predicting missing relationships between entities in knowledge graphs through learning their representations. Currently, the majority of existing link prediction models employ simple but intuitive scoring functions and relatively small embedding size so that they could be applied to large-scale knowledge graphs. However, these properties also restrict the ability to learn more expressive and robust features. Therefore, diverging from most of the prior works which focus on designing new objective functions, we propose, DeCom, a simple but effective mechanism to boost the performance of existing link predictors such as DistMult, ComplEx, etc, through extracting more expressive features while preventing overfitting by adding just a few extra parameters. Specifically, embeddings of entities and relationships are first decompressed to a more expressive and robust space by decompressing functions, then knowledge graph embedding models are trained in this new feature space. Experimental results on several benchmark knowledge graphs and advanced link prediction systems demonstrate the generalization and effectiveness of our method. Especially, RESCAL + DeCom achieves state-of-the-art performance on the FB15k-237 benchmark across all evaluation metrics. In addition, we also show that compared with DeCom, explicitly increasing the embedding size significantly increase the number of parameters but could not achieve promising performance improvement.",

Our results show that the former consistently outperforms the latter across a diverse set of datasets. In addition, through an ablation study, we show that a learnable curvature initialized with the delta hyperbolicity of the utilized data yields superior results to random initializations.

      "abstract": "Entity alignment aims to find entities in different knowledge graphs (KGs) that refer to the same real-world object. An effective solution for cross-lingual entity alignment is crucial for many cross-lingual AI and NLP applications. Recently many embedding-based approaches were proposed for cross-lingual entity alignment. However, almost all of them are based on TransE or its variants, which have been demonstrated by many studies to be unsuitable for encoding multi-mapping relations such as 1-N, N-1 and N-N relations, thus these methods obtain low alignment precision. To solve this issue, we propose a new embedding-based framework. Through defining dot product-based functions over embeddings, our model can better capture the semantics of both 1-1 and multi-mapping relations. We calibrate embeddings of different KGs via a small set of pre-aligned seeds. We also propose a weighted negative sampling strategy to generate valuable negative samples during training and we regard prediction as a bidirectional problem in the end. Experimental results (especially with the metric Hits@1) on real-world multilingual datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms many other embedding-based approaches with state-of-the-art performance.",

Instead of feature mappings, we define the model directly in hyperbolic space with the Lorentz model. Our model considers each relation in knowledge graphs as a Lorentz rotation from the head entity to the tail entity. We adopt the Lorentzian version distance as the scoring function for measuring the plausibility of triplets. Extensive results on standard knowledge graph completion benchmarks demonstrated that our model achieves competitive results with fewer parameters.

      "abstract": "Conversational recommender systems (CRS) endow traditional recommender systems with the capability of dynamically obtaining users’ short-term preferences for items and attributes through interactive dialogues. There are three core challenges for CRS, including the intelligent decisions for what attributes to ask, which items to recommend, and when to ask or recommend, at each conversation turn. Previous methods mainly leverage reinforcement learning (RL) to learn conversational recommendation policies for solving one or two of these three decision-making problems in CRS with separated conversation and recommendation components. These approaches restrict the scalability and generality of CRS and fall short of preserving a stable training procedure. In the light of these challenges, we tackle these three decision-making problems in CRS as a unified policy learning task. In order to leverage different features that are important to each sub-problem and facilitate better unified policy learning in CRS, we propose two novel multi-agent RL-based frameworks, namely Independent and Hierarchical Multi-Agent UNIfied COnversational RecommeNders (IMA-UNICORN and HMA-UNICORN), respectively. In specific, two low-level agents enrich the state representations for attribute prediction and item recommendation, by combining the long-term user preference information from the historical interaction data and the short-term user preference information from the conversation history. A high-level meta agent is responsible for coordinating the low-level agents to adaptively make the final decision. Experimental results on four benchmark CRS datasets and a real-world E-Commerce application show that the proposed frameworks significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods. Extensive analyses further demonstrate the superior scalability of the MARL frameworks on the multi-round conversational recommendation.",

      "abstract": "Security-related events are continuously emerging around the world, such as social unrest, armed conflicts and natural disasters. Although event knowledge graphs provide a concise and intuitive way to organize event information, they often suffer from the incompleteness problem. To solve this problem, the knowledge graph reasoning technique is usually adopted to infer new facts based on existing relations of entities. However, existing reasoning methods often concentrate on the entity relations, without considering the attributes of nodes for event knowledge graphs, such as event descriptions and event time, which contain rich information of events and are vital for event relation reasoning. Existing methods are also deficient in interpretability, which significantly benefits security-related decision-making scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Neuro-Logic Learning (NLL) method for relation reasoning over event knowledge graph. Our method first adopts different event attributes to learn the semantic representations of events, and ranks candidate event relation triples according to their similarity scores. The proposed method then develops the neural logic rule leaner to obtain interpretable reasoning rules. We construct a new large-scale event relation dataset EventKG-R based on EventKG to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves superior performances compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.",

      "abstract": "Accurate prediction of key ocean elements (e.g., chlorophyll-a concentration, sea surface temperature, etc.) is imperative for maintaining marine ecological balance, responding to marine disaster pollution, and promoting the sustainable use of marine resources. Existing spatio-temporal prediction models primarily rely on either physical or data-driven approaches. Physical models are constrained by modeling complexity and parameterization errors, while data-driven models lack interpretability and depend on high-quality data. To address these challenges, this study proposes OKG-ConvGRU, a domain knowledge-guided remote sensing prediction framework for ocean elements. This framework integrates knowledge graphs with the ConvGRU network, leveraging prior knowledge from marine science to enhance the prediction performance of ocean elements in remotely sensed images. Firstly, we construct a spatio-temporal knowledge graph for ocean elements (OKG), followed by semantic embedding representation for its spatial and temporal dimensions. Subsequently, a cross-attention-based feature fusion module (CAFM) is designed to efficiently integrate spatio-temporal multimodal features. Finally, these fused features are incorporated into an enhanced ConvGRU network. For multi-step prediction, we adopt a Seq2Seq architecture combined with a multi-step rolling strategy. Prediction experiments for chlorophyll-a concentration in the eastern seas of China validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results show that, compared to baseline models, OKG-ConvGRU exhibits significant advantages in prediction accuracy, long-term stability, data utilization efficiency, and robustness. This study provides a scientific foundation and technical support for the precise monitoring and sustainable development of marine ecological environments.",

The effectiveness of TKGE largely depends on the ability to model intrinsic relation patterns and capture specific information about entities and relations. However, existing approaches can capture only some of them with insufficient modeling capacity, and none has a “deep” architecture for modeling the entries in a quadruple at the same dimension. In this article, we propose a more powerful KGE framework named DuCape, which combines a dual quaternion and capsule network in modeling for the first time to make up for the defects of existing TKGE models. In dual quaternion vector space, the head entity learns a k-dimensional rigid transformation parametrized by relation and time, falling near its corresponding tail entity. Further, we employ the embeddings of entities, relations, and time trained from dual quaternion vector space as the input to capsule networks. Experimental results on several basic datasets show that the DuCape model constructed in this article is superior to existing state-of-the-art models.",

      "abstract": "Inductive link prediction -- where entities during training and inference stages can be different -- has shown great potential for completing evolving knowledge graphs in an entity-independent manner. Many popular methods mainly focus on modeling graph-level features, while the edge-level interactions -- especially the semantic correlations between relations -- have been less explored. However, we notice a desirable property of semantic correlations between relations is that they are inherently edge-level and entity-independent. This implies the great potential of the semantic correlations for the entity-independent inductive link prediction task. Inspired by this observation, we propose a novel subgraph-based method, namely TACO, to model Topology-Aware COrrelations between relations that are highly correlated to their topological structures within subgraphs. Specifically, we prove that semantic correlations between any two relations can be categorized into seven topological patterns, and then proposes Relational Correlation Network (RCN) to learn the importance of each pattern. To further exploit the potential of RCN, we propose Complete Common Neighbor induced subgraph that can effectively preserve complete topological patterns within the subgraph. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TACO effectively unifies the graph-level information and edge-level interactions to jointly perform reasoning, leading to a superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods for the inductive link prediction task.",

      "abstract": "N-ary relational Knowledge Bases (KBs) allow knowledge to be represented beyond binary relational facts. With a surge in interest in modeling n-ary relational facts, recent approaches have achieved considerable progress on the knowledge inference task. However, these models have generally ignored the hard negative entities. The hard negative entities share the same entity-relation query couple in the primary triple with the ground truth entity, but do not satisfy the n-ary relational query. The existence of hard negative entities is a very important and unique characteristic of n-ary relational KBs in contrast to binary relational KBs. We propose a hard-negative-aware contrastive learning based method for knowledge inference on n-ary relational facts. Our framework is simple and effective, and can be directly applied to any recent approaches on n-ary relational facts without further modification. The empirical findings across three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of this framework.",

In this paper, we first perform an insightful exploratory analysis to exploit the transfer phenomenon of financing needs among SMEs, which motivates us to fully exploit the multi-relation enterprise social network for boosting the effectiveness of FNE. The main challenge lies in modeling two kinds of heterogeneity, i.e., transfer heterogeneity and SMEs’ behavior heterogeneity, under different relation types simultaneously. To address these challenges, we propose a graph neural network named Multi-relation tRanslatIonal GrapH aTtention network (M-RIGHT), which not only models the transfer heterogeneity of financing needs along different relation types based on a novel entity—relation composition operator but also enables heterogeneous SMEs’ representations based on a translation mechanism on relational hyperplanes to distinguish SMEs’ heterogeneous behaviors under different relation types. Extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate M-RIGHT’s superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in the FNE task.",

Inspired by graph attention neural networks and course prerequisite relationships, we propose PreKGAT. PreKGAT extracts prerequisite relationships between courses through generated meta-paths, and uses the prerequisite relationships of courses to enrich the course knowledge graph. The entities in the knowledge graph are embedded and propagated to mine the course information related to user preferences. Next, graph convolutional networks are used to aggregate neighborhood features to obtain feature representations of users and courses, and attention mechanisms are used to distinguish the importance of neighborhoods and enhance the embedding representations of nodes. Finally, the ratings between users and courses are predicted. The experimental results showed that compared with the optimal baseline, F1@10 and Mrr@10 increased by 2.26% and 1.08%, respectively.",

In this article, we propose Num2vec, an algorithmic framework to learn numeric representations. Specifically, Num2vec lists three main logic characteristics of numbers: arithmetic, direction, and periodicity. By representing numbers into a transition space, Num2vec can translates numbers agilely to different Internet of Things tasks through selecting the corresponding characteristics. According to such a design, Num2vec enjoys flexible numeric representations to fit different Internet of Things time series tasks.

      "abstract": "In today's data-driven world, the ability to extract meaningful information from data is becoming essential for businesses, organizations and researchers alike. For that purpose, a wide range of tools and systems exist addressing data-related tasks, from data integration, preprocessing and modeling, to the interpretation and evaluation of the results. As data continues to grow in volume, variety, and complexity, there is an increasing need for advanced but user-friendly tools, such as intelligent discovery assistants (IDAs) or automated machine learning (AutoML) systems, that facilitate the user's interaction with the data. This enables non-expert users, such as citizen data scientists, to leverage powerful data analytics techniques effectively. The assistance offered by IDAs or AutoML tools should not be guided only by the analytical problem's data but should also be tailored to each individual user. To this end, this work explores the usage of Knowledge Graphs (KG) as a basic framework for capturing in a human-centered manner complex analytics workflows, by storing information not only about the workflow's components, datasets and algorithms but also about the users, their intents and their feedback, among others. The data stored in the generated KG can then be exploited to provide assistance (e.g., recommendations) to the users interacting with these systems. To accomplish this objective, two methods are explored in this work. Initially, the usage of query templates to extract relevant information from the KG is studied. However, upon identifying its main limitations, the usage of link prediction with knowledge graph embeddings is explored, which enhances flexibility and allows leveraging the entire structure and components of the graph. The experiments show that the proposed method is able to capture the graph's structure and to produce sensible suggestions.",

However, we found that inherent heterogeneity among factor tensors in tensor decomposition significantly hinders the tensor fusion process and further limits the performance of link prediction. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel method that maps factor tensors onto a unified smooth Lie group manifold to make the distribution of factor tensors approximating homogeneous in tensor decomposition. We provide the theoretical proof of our motivation that homogeneous tensors are more effective than heterogeneous tensors in tensor fusion and approximating the target for tensor decomposition based TKGE methods. The proposed method can be directly integrated into existing tensor decomposition based TKGE methods without introducing extra parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating the heterogeneity and in enhancing the tensor decomposition based TKGE models.",

      "abstract": "In link prediction evaluation, an embedding model assigns plausibility scores to unseen triples in a knowledge graph using an input partial triple. Performance metrics like mean rank are useful to compare models side by side, but do not shed light on their behavior. Interpreting link prediction evaluation and comparing models based on such interpretation are appealing. Current interpretation methods have mainly focused on single predictions or other tasks different from link prediction. Since knowledge graph embedding methods are diverse, interpretation methods that are applicable only to certain machine learning approaches cannot be used. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic method for interpreting link prediction evaluation as a whole. The interpretation consists of Horn rules mined from the knowledge graph containing the triples a model deems plausible. We combine precision and recall measurements of mined rules using Fβ score to quantify interpretation accuracy. To maximize interpretation accuracy when comparing models, we study two approximations to the hard problem of merging rules. Our quantitative study shows that interpretation accuracy serves to compare diverse models side by side, and that these comparisons are different from those using ranks. Our qualitative study shows that several models globally capture expected semantics, and that models make a common set of predictions despite of redundancy reduction.",

The approach is used to discover public value expressions in patents. Using text (5.4 million sentences) for 154,934 US AI patent documents from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), we design a semi-automated, human-supervised framework for identifying and labeling public value expressions in these sentences. A GPT-4 prompt is developed that includes definitions, guidelines, examples, and rationales for text classification. We evaluate the labels and rationales produced by GPT-4 using BLEU scores and topic modeling, finding that they are accurate, diverse, and faithful. GPT-4 achieved an advanced recognition of public value expressions from our framework, which it also uses to discover unseen public value expressions. The GPT-produced labels are used to train BERT-based classifiers and predict sentences on the entire database, achieving high F1 scores for the 3-class (0.85) and 2-class classification (0.91) tasks. We discuss the implications of our approach for conducting large-scale text analyses with complex and abstract concepts. With careful framework design and interactive human oversight, we suggest that generative language models can offer significant assistance in producing labels and rationales.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) embedding methods which map entities and relations to unique embeddings in the KG have shown promising results on many reasoning tasks. However, the same embedding dimension for both dense entities and sparse entities will cause either over parameterization (sparse entities) or under fitting (dense entities). Normally, a large dimension is set to get better performance. Meanwhile, the inference time grows log-linearly with the number of entities for all entities are traversed and compared. Both the parameter and inference become challenges when working with huge amounts of entities. Thus, we propose PIE, a \\textbf{p}arameter and \\textbf{i}nference \\textbf{e}fficient solution. Inspired from tensor decomposition methods, we find that decompose entity embedding matrix into low rank matrices can reduce more than half of the parameters while maintaining comparable performance. To accelerate model inference, we propose a self-supervised auxiliary task, which can be seen as fine-grained entity typing. By randomly masking and recovering entities' connected relations, the task learns the co-occurrence of entity and relations. Utilizing the fine grained typing, we can filter unrelated entities during inference and get targets with possibly sub-linear time requirement. Experiments on link prediction benchmarks demonstrate the proposed key capabilities. Moreover, we prove effectiveness of the proposed solution on the Open Graph Benchmark large scale challenge dataset WikiKG90Mv2 and achieve the state of the art performance.",

The SGE tackles the heterogeneity in the frequency of entities through semantic reconstruction and a guidance network. The semantic reconstruction strengthens the semantic relevance among all entities and connects entities with different frequencies in semantic space. The guidance network extends these connections to knowledge space, enhancing the expression abilities of infrequent entities’ embeddings without compromising the embeddings of frequent entities. Experiments with four commonly used benchmark datasets show that the SGE method improves the performance of baseline models in most cases and that the method is model‐independent.",

      "abstract": "Entity alignment aims to accurately identify corresponding entities in different knowledge graphs, and is the cornerstone of building comprehensive network knowledge graphs. Traditional methods rely on labeling information to achieve accurate matching, but self-supervised learning in recent years has inspired us to find that simultaneously pulling positive entity pairs and pushing away unlabeled negative entity pairs in entity alignment learning is more effective than pulling positive entity pairs only. This suggests that unlabeled entities also contain latent information. Based on this finding, the DSEA strategy is proposed, a dynamic multi-attention mechanism is designed to deeply mine the rich information and semantic features in the text, and NTXentLoss is proposed to make the DSEA strategy more precise, so that it can optimize the entity alignment objective without label supervision, which improves the accuracy and efficiency. To verify the accuracy of the model, we conduct experiments on the public datasets DWY100K. The experimental results show that our method outperforms existing methods and is able to effectively achieve entity alignment through self-supervised learning.",

      "title": "Incorporating Domain Knowledge Graph into Multimodal Movie Genre Classification with Self-Supervised Attention and Contrastive Learning",
      "abstract": "Multimodal movie genre classification has always been regarded as a demanding multi-label classification task due to the diversity of multimodal data such as posters, plot summaries, trailers and metadata. Although existing works have made great progress in modeling and combining each modality, they still face three issues: 1) unutilized group relations in metadata, 2) unreliable attention allocation, and 3) indiscriminative fused features. Given that the knowledge graph has been proven to contain rich information, we present a novel framework that exploits the knowledge graph from various perspectives to address the above problems. As a preparation, the metadata is processed into a domain knowledge graph. A translate model for knowledge graph embedding is adopted to capture the relations between entities. Firstly we retrieve the relevant embedding from the knowledge graph by utilizing group relations in metadata and then integrate it with other modalities. Next, we introduce an Attention Teacher module for reliable attention allocation based on self-supervised learning. It learns the distribution of the knowledge graph and produces rational attention weights. Finally, a Genre-Centroid Anchored Contrastive Learning module is proposed to strengthen the discriminative ability of fused features. The embedding space of anchors is initialized from the genre entities in the knowledge graph. To verify the effectiveness of our framework, we collect a larger and more challenging dataset named MM-IMDb 2.0 compared with the MM-IMDb dataset. The experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our model is superior to the state-of-the-art methods. Our code and dataset is available at https://github.com/aoluming/IDKG.git.",

      "abstract": "Learning with relational and network-structured data is increasingly vital in sensitive domains where protecting the privacy of individual entities is paramount. Differential Privacy (DP) offers a principled approach for quantifying privacy risks, with DP-SGD emerging as a standard mechanism for private model training. However, directly applying DP-SGD to relational learning is challenging due to two key factors: (i) entities often participate in multiple relations, resulting in high and difficult-to-control sensitivity; and (ii) relational learning typically involves multi-stage, potentially coupled (interdependent) sampling procedures that make standard privacy amplification analyses inapplicable. This work presents a principled framework for relational learning with formal entity-level DP guarantees. We provide a rigorous sensitivity analysis and introduce an adaptive gradient clipping scheme that modulates clipping thresholds based on entity occurrence frequency. We also extend the privacy amplification results to a tractable subclass of coupled sampling, where the dependence arises only through sample sizes. These contributions lead to a tailored DP-SGD variant for relational data with provable privacy guarantees. Experiments on fine-tuning text encoders over text-attributed network-structured relational data demonstrate the strong utility-privacy trade-offs of our approach.

      "abstract": "The loss of power grid efficiency is affected by a number of factors, including the physical characteristics of the equipment used, the operational characteristics of the power grid itself, the characteristics of the electricity being used, and the natural conditions present. The application of a simple line loss rate value is inadequate for the objective evaluation of the implementation of line loss management in different provinces. Accordingly, this paper puts forth an innovative comprehensive evaluation method for municipal power grid line loss management, namely the construction of a comprehensive management evaluation knowledge graph for line loss. This method integrates the dimensionality reduction capability of nuclear principal component analysis with the combined decision support capability of DEMATEL-Entropy Weight-TOPSIS, thereby achieving a comprehensive evaluation of power grid line loss in the whole process and across multiple dimensions. The empirical analysis of cross-sectional data based on line loss management in Guangxi from 2014 to 2016 demonstrates that the line loss evaluation index system proposed in this paper effectively reduces the redundancy of line loss data. To illustrate, the municipal power grid in Guangxi (GL city) has demonstrated a gradual enhancement in the competitiveness of its management and planning loss reduction strategies. However, there has been a notable decline in the competitiveness of its operational and technical loss reduction approaches, with a reduction of approximately 23.7%. Therefore, the overall development of the city’s power grid line loss level can be considered stable. This method allows for an objective and reasonable reflection of the actual situation differences in line loss management work, thus providing a basis for future line loss management evaluation.",

The selected methods were chosen due to their classical and commonly employed nature in prior research. The study follows a systematic research flow encompassing data extraction, preprocessing, RDF mapping, and model training, aiming to comprehensively evaluate these models on a non-benchmark employee dataset from Telkomsel. The findings reveal distinct strengths and weaknesses of each model. TransE displays consistent accuracy in placing entities correctly, while ComplEx showcases notable adaptability to diverse HR relationships, contributing to its efficacy in capturing intricate connections, and TransH provides nuanced insights with a unique semantic relationship perspective, offering semantic depth in HR domains. Our research acknowledges that the current performance metrics (MR, MRR, and Hits@K) of TransE, ComplEx, and TransH in adapting to HR knowledge graphs are below those reported in previous studies using benchmark datasets (FB15K and WN18RR), emphasizing the need for transparent acknowledgment and paving the way for future improvements to achieve higher accuracy. In conclusion, this research pioneers evaluating KGC methods on non-benchmark HR datasets, providing practical insights for HR information system management. It lays a foundation for applying Knowledge Graph Completion methods, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical applications in HR knowledge graphs.",

      "abstract": "Traditional collaborative filtering (CF)-based recommendation systems are often challenged by data sparsity. The recent research has recognized the potential of integrating new information sources, such as knowledge graphs, to address this issue. However, a common drawback is the neglect of the interplay between user–item interaction data and knowledge graph information, resulting in insufficient model performance due to coarse-grained feature fusion. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel graph neural network (GNN) model called KGCFRec, which leverages both Knowledge Graph and user–item Collaborative Filtering information for an enhanced Recommender system. KGCFRec employs a dual-channel information propagation and aggregation mechanism to generate distinct representations for the collaborative knowledge graph and the user–item interaction graph. This is followed by an attention mechanism that adaptively fuses the knowledge graph with collaborative information, thereby refining the representations and narrowing the gap between them. The experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that KGCFRec outperforms state-of-the-art methods. These promising results underscore the capability of KGCFRec to enhance recommendation accuracy by integrating knowledge graph information.",

      "abstract": "Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive results but still suffer from hallucinations. Model editing has been proposed to correct factual inaccuracies in LLMs. A challenging case is sequential model editing (SME), which aims to rectify errors continuously rather than treating them as a one-time task. During SME, the general capabilities of LLMs can be negatively affected due to the introduction of new parameters. In this paper, we propose a queue-based self-correction framework (QueueEDIT) that not only enhances SME performance by addressing long-sequence dependency but also mitigates the impact of parameter bias on the general capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, we first introduce a structural mapping editing loss to map the triplets to the knowledge-sensitive neurons within the Transformer layers of LLMs. We then store the located parameters for each piece of edited knowledge in a queue and dynamically align previously edited parameters. In each edit, we select queue parameters most relevant to the currently located parameters to determine whether previous knowledge needs realignment. Irrelevant parameters in the queue are frozen, and we update the parameters at the queue head to the LLM to ensure they do not harm general abilities. Experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms strong baselines across various SME settings and maintains competitiveness in single-turn editing. The resulting LLMs also preserve high capabilities in general NLP tasks throughout the SME process.",

      "abstract": "Geographic knowledge graph representation learning embeds entities and relationships in geographic knowledge graphs into a low-dimensional continuous vector space, which serves as a basic method that bridges geographic knowledge graphs and geographic applications. Previous geographic knowledge graph representation methods primarily learn the vectors of entities and their relationships from their spatial attributes and relationships, which ignores various semantics of entities, resulting in poor embeddings on geographic knowledge graphs. This study proposes a two-stage multimodal geographic knowledge graph representation (MGKGR) model that integrates multiple kinds of semantics to improve the embedding learning of geographic knowledge graph representation. Specifically, in the first stage, a spatial feature fusion method for modality enhancement is proposed to combine the structural features of geographic knowledge graphs with two modal semantic features. In the second stage, a multi-level modality feature fusion method is proposed to integrate heterogeneous features from different modalities. By fusing the semantics of text and images, the performance of geographic knowledge graph representation is improved, providing accurate representations for downstream geographic intelligence tasks. Extensive experiments on two datasets show that the proposed MGKGR model outperforms the baselines. Moreover, the results demonstrate that integrating textual and image data into geographic knowledge graphs can effectively enhance the model’s performance.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) has attracted increasing attention. Relation patterns, such as symmetry and inversion, have received considerable focus. Among them, composition patterns are particularly important, as they involve nearly all relations in KGs. However, prior KGE approaches often consider relations to be compositional only if they are well-represented in the training data. Consequently, it can lead to performance degradation, especially for under-represented composition patterns. To this end, we propose HolmE, a general form of KGE with its relation embedding space closed under composition, namely that the composition of any two given relation embeddings remains within the embedding space. This property ensures that every relation embedding can compose, or be composed by other relation embeddings. It enhances HolmE’s capability to model under-represented (also called long-tail) composition patterns with limited learning instances. To our best knowledge, our work is pioneering in discussing KGE with this property of being closed under composition. We provide detailed theoretical proof and extensive experiments to demonstrate the notable advantages of HolmE in modelling composition patterns, particularly for long-tail patterns. Our results also highlight HolmE’s effectiveness in extrapolating to unseen relations through composition and its state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the combination of knowledge graph (KG) and recommendation algorithms has achieved significant success. KG contains rich information to improve users and items representations as side information. Existing KG-aware recommendation methods have shown effectiveness in some cases. However, we contend these methods mainly focus on extracting structural semantic information from KG, while not fully exploring the collaborative semantic information (semantically similar information that may not be directly reflected in the graph structure). Considering the heterogeneity of KG, we design a novel method under the contrastive learning paradigm, named Knowledge Graph Recommendation based on Structural Semantics and Collaborative Semantics (KGSC). In this paper, we focus on exploring the integration of collaborative semantic information and studying the complementary relationship between structural semantics and collaborative semantics. Specifically, we assume that users (items) with similar representations exist in the same latent space. By mapping all entities representations into a collaborative semantic space, we are able to capture the underlying \"commonality\" features among entities. Then, we include them into contrastive pairs, to better mine users (items) features and relationships. Extensive experiments on three real-world public datasets show that our KGSC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of representation learning is to encode the entities and relations in a knowledge graph as low-dimensional and real-valued vectors through machine learning technology. Traditional representation learning methods like TransE, a method which models relationships by interpreting them as translations operating on the low-dimensional embeddings of a graph’s entities, are effective for learning the embeddings of knowledge bases, but struggle to effectively model complex relations like one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many. To overcome the above issues, we introduce a new method for knowledge representation, reasoning, and completion based on multi-translation principles and TransE (TransE-MTP). By defining multiple translation principles (MTPs) for different relation types, such as one-to-one and complex relations like one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many, and combining MTPs with a typical translating-based model for modeling multi-relational data (TransE), the proposed method, TransE-MTP, ensures that multiple optimization objectives can be targeted and optimized during training on complex relations, thereby providing superior prediction performance. We implement a prototype of TransE-MTP to demonstrate its effectiveness at link prediction and triplet classification on two prominent knowledge graph datasets: Freebase and Wordnet.

      "abstract": "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are promising for graph learning tasks. For privacy-preserving graph learning tasks involving distributed graph datasets, federated learning (FL)-based GCN (FedGCN) training is required. An important open challenge for FedGCN is scaling to large graphs, which typically incurs 1) high computation overhead for handling the explosively-increasing number of neighbors, and 2) high communication overhead of training GCNs involving multiple FL clients. Thus, neighbor sampling is being studied to enhance the scalability of FedGCNs. Existing FedGCN training techniques with neighbor sampling often produce extremely large communication and computation overhead and inaccurate node embeddings, leading to poor model performance. To bridge this gap, we propose the Federated Adaptive Attention-based Sampling (FedAAS) approach. It achieves substantial cost savings by efficiently leveraging historical embedding estimators and focusing the limited communication resources on transmitting the most influential neighbor node embeddings across FL clients. We further design an adaptive embedding synchronization scheme to optimize the efficiency and accuracy of FedAAS on large-scale datasets. Theoretical analysis shows that the approximation error induced by the staleness of historical embedding is upper bounded, and the model is guaranteed to converge in an efficient manner. Extensive experimental evaluation against four state-of-the-art baselines on six real-world graph datasets show that FedAAS achieves up to 5.12% higher test accuracy, while saving communication and computation costs by 95.11% and 94.76%, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Cephalo is presented as a series of multimodal vision large language models (V‐LLMs) designed for materials science applications, integrating visual and linguistic data for enhanced understanding. A key innovation of Cephalo is its advanced dataset generation method. Cephalo is trained on integrated image and text data from thousands of scientific papers and science‐focused Wikipedia data demonstrates it can interpret complex visual scenes, generate precise language descriptions, and answer queries about images effectively. The combination of a vision encoder with an autoregressive transformer supports multimodal natural language understanding, which can be coupled with other generative methods to create an image‐to‐text‐to‐3D pipeline. To develop more capable models from smaller ones, both mixture‐of‐expert methods and model merging are reported. The models are examined in diverse use cases that incorporate biological materials, fracture and engineering analysis, protein biophysics, and bio‐inspired design based on insect behavior. Generative applications include bio‐inspired designs, including pollen‐inspired architected materials, as well as the synthesis of bio‐inspired material microstructures from a photograph of a solar eclipse. Additional model fine‐tuning with a series of molecular dynamics results demonstrate Cephalo's enhanced capabilities to accurately predict statistical features of stress and atomic energy distributions, as well as crack dynamics and damage in materials.",

However, existing methods for modeling user intents often do so by statically setting the intent count, which can result in redundancy or insufficiency in capturing the full range of user intents. In order to solve this problem, this article proposes a model named Intent-aware Recommendation Based on Principal Component Analysis (Intent PCA). Intent PCA is a novel application of PCA in the field of recommender systems. This model defines intents as users’ preferences for some specific relations shown on a knowledge graph and constructs a user-relation matrix to calculate users’ preferences for relations. Then PCA is applied on the user-relation matrix to extract user intents. Benefit from good characteristics of PCA, our PCA-based user intent extraction model can comprehensively model user intents while simultaneously avoid intent redundancy. Moreover, by combining the user intents, this article designs an intent-based information propagation method to differentially aggregate information from surrounding neighbor nodes. Experiments conducted on three datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed Intent PCA model.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) embedding has been used to benefit the diagnosis of animal diseases by analyzing electronic medical records (EMRs), such as notes and veterinary records. However, learning representations to capture entities and relations with literal information in KGs is challenging as the KGs show heterogeneous properties and various types of literal information. Meanwhile, the existing methods mostly aim to preserve graph structures surrounding target nodes without considering different types of literals, which could also carry significant information. In this paper, we propose a knowledge graph embedding model for the efficient diagnosis of animal diseases, which could learn various types of literal information and graph structure and fuse them into unified representations, namely LiteralKG. Specifically, we construct a knowledge graph that is built from EMRs along with literal information collected from various animal hospitals. We then fuse different types of entities and node feature information into unified vector representations through gate networks. Finally, we propose a self-supervised learning task to learn graph structure in pretext tasks and then towards various downstream tasks. Experimental results on link prediction tasks demonstrate that our model outperforms the baselines that consist of state-of-the-art models.",

      "abstract": "Networks representation aims to encode vertices into a low-dimensional space, while preserving the original network structures and properties. Most existing methods focus on static network structure without considering temporal dynamics. However, in real world, most networks (e.g., social and biological networks) are dynamic in nature and are constantly evolving over time. Such temporal dynamics are critical in representations learning, especially for predicting dynamic networks behaviors. To this end, a Deep Hawkes Process based Dynamic Networks Representation algorithm (DHPrep) is proposed in this paper, which is capable of capturing temporal dynamics of dynamic networks. Specifically, DHPrep incorporates both structural information and temporal dynamics to learn vertices representations that can model the edge formation process for a vertex pair, where the structural information is used to capture the historical impact from their neighborhood, and the temporal dynamics utilize this historical information and apply Hawkes point process to model the edges formation process. Moreover, a temporal smoother is further imposed to ensure the representations evolve smoothly over time. To evaluate the effectiveness of DHPrep, extensive experiments are carried out using four real-world datasets. Experimental results reveal that our DHPrep algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in various tasks including link prediction and vertices recommendation.",

      "abstract": "Native artificial intelligence (AI) has played a pivotal role in shaping the evolution of 6G networks. It must meet stringent real-time requirements and therefore deploying lightweight AI models is necessary. However, as wireless networks generate a multitude of data fields and only a fraction of them imposes significant impact on the AI models, it is essential to accurately identify a small amount of critical data that significantly impacts communication performance. In this paper, we propose the pervasive multi-level (PML) native AI architecture, which incorporates knowledge graph (KG) into mobile network operations to establish a wireless data KG. Leveraging the wireless data KG, we analyze the relationships among various data fields and provide the on-demand generation of minimal and effective datasets, referred to as feature datasets. Consequently, it not only enhances AI training, inference, and validation processes but also significantly reduces resource wastage and overhead for communication networks. The proposed solution includes a spatio-temporal heterogeneous graph attention neural network model (STREAM) and a feature dataset generation algorithm. Experimental results validate the exceptional capability of STREAM in handling spatio-temporal data and demonstrate that the proposed architecture effectively reduces data scale and computational costs of AI training by almost an order of magnitude.",

      "abstract": "This paper aims to develop a robust methodology for unraveling the complex causal relationships inherent in disease dynamics, using observational data as a basis. Our primary objective is to elucidate the intricate network of causal factors influencing disease cases, with a specific focus on breast quadrant disease. To achieve this, we employ Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) as our primary analytical tool. Our approach begins by constructing a fully connected graph to hypothesize potential causal links among various factors. This graph undergoes a meticulous refinement process through Conditional Independence (CI) tests, which systematically eliminates non-significant connections. The outcome is a streamlined DAG that clearly maps out both direct and indirect causal relationships relevant to disease progression. The validity and effectiveness of our model are rigorously tested using a score-based Hill-Climbing (HC) algorithm, which ensures that our causal inferences align accurately with real-world data. The culmination of this process is demonstrated through the application of our methodology to a dataset focusing on breast quadrant disease. Our findings reveal significant causal connections within this dataset, which have been corroborated by expert opinions in the field. These results not only validate our approach but also emphasize its practical utility in deciphering complex causal relationships in medical research.",

      "abstract": "Entity alignment is a basic and vital technique in knowledge graph (KG) integration. Over the years, research on entity alignment has resided on the assumption that KGs are static, which neglects the nature of growth of real-world KGs. As KGs grow, previous alignment results face the need to be revisited while new entity alignment waits to be discovered. In this paper, we propose and dive into a realistic yet unexplored setting, referred to as continual entity alignment. To avoid retraining an entire model on the whole KGs whenever new entities and triples come, we present a continual alignment method for this task. It reconstructs an entity's representation based on entity adjacency, enabling it to generate embeddings for new entities quickly and inductively using their existing neighbors. It selects and replays partial pre-aligned entity pairs to train only parts of KGs while extracting trustworthy alignment for knowledge augmentation. As growing KGs inevitably contain non-matchable entities, different from previous works, the proposed method employs bidirectional nearest neighbor matching to find new entity alignment and update old alignment. Furthermore, we also construct new datasets by simulating the growth of multilingual DBpedia. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our continual alignment method is more effective than baselines based on retraining or inductive learning.",

Different modal encoders are employed to extract structural, visual, and textual features, and symmetrical hybrid key-value calculations are performed on features from different modalities based on the Transformer architecture. The similarities of textual tags to structural tags and visual tags are calculated and aggregated, respectively, and multimodal entity representations are modeled and optimized to reduce the heterogeneity of the representations. The experimental results show that compared with the current multimodal SOTA method, MKGformer, MM-Transformer improves the Hits@1 and Hits@10 evaluation indicators by 1.17% and 1.39%, respectively, proving that the proposed method can effectively solve the problem of multimodal feature fusion in the knowledge graph link prediction task.",

The validity of coauthorship as a proxy for scientific collaboration is affected by this. Using bibliometric data from publications in the field of genomics, we examine the impact of hyperauthorship on metrics of scientific collaboration, and propose a method to determine a suitable cutoff threshold for hyperauthored papers and compare coauthorship networks with and without hyperauthored works. Our analysis reveals that including hyperauthored papers dramatically impacts the structural positioning of central authors and the topological characteristics of the network, while producing small influences on whole-network cohesion measures. We present two solutions to minimize the impact of hyperauthorship: using a mathematically grounded and reproducible calculation of threshold cutoff to exclude hyperauthored papers or fractional counting to weight network results. Our findings affirm the structural influences of hyperauthored papers and suggest that scholars should be mindful when using coauthorship networks to study scientific collaboration.",

      "abstract": "Hyper-relational knowledge graphs (HKGs) extend the traditional triplet-based knowledge graph by adding qualifiers to the relationships, making HKGs particularly useful for tasks that require more profound understanding and inference from relationships between entities. However, existing hyper-relational knowledge representation learning methods (HKRL) focus on direct neighbourhood information of entities only by neglecting the relational similarity of the main triple in hyper-relational facts and the attribute details in the qualifiers. In addition, few works extract common and private information across multiple views to minimize noise and interference. This paper proposes a multi-hypergraph disentanglement method for HKRL to address the above issues. Specifically, we first construct four hypergraphs to mine and utilise the inherent structure information of HKGs, and then propose to extract common representations among hypergraphs and private representations within individual hypergraphs to mine the semantic information and the task-relevant information, respectively.

      "abstract": "Knowledge embedding for geographic knowledge graphs can effectively improve computational efficiency and provide support for knowledge reasoning, knowledge answering and other applications of knowledge graphs. To maintain a more comprehensive understanding of spatial features through knowledge embedding, it is crucial to integrate the representation and computation of various entity types, encompassing points, lines, and polygons. This article proposes a geographic entities uniformly explicit knowledge embedding model (GEUKE). In GEUKE, spatial data of point, line, and polygon‐type geographic entities are expressed in the form of subgraphs, and space embedding is generated using a SubGNN‐based uniform spatial feature encoder. GEUKE improves the energy function in TransE to train spatial feature‐based embedding and structural‐based embedding of geographic entities into a unified vector space. Experimental results show that GEUKE has higher performance than TransE, TransH, TransD, and TransE‐GDR on link prediction and triple classification task. Within the spatial feature embedding process, GEUKE effectively preserves the inherent features of entities, encompassing location, neighborhood, and structural attributes, while simultaneously ensuring a coherent spatial data representation across all three entity types: points, lines, and polygons. By maintaining the spatial features of geographic entities and their interrelations, this capability unleashes the full potential of applications such as knowledge reasoning and geospatial question answering in a manner that is conducive to diverse geospatial scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to infer new knowledge and make predictions from knowledge graphs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities. LLM-enhanced KGC methods primarily focus on designing task-specific instructions, achieving promising advancements. However, there are still two critical challenges. First, existing methods often ignore the inconsistent representation spaces between natural language and graph structures. Second, most approaches design separate instructions for different KGC tasks, leading to duplicate works and time-consuming processes. To address these challenges, we propose SAT, a novel framework that enhances LLMs for KGC via structure-aware alignment-tuning. Specifically, we first introduce hierarchical knowledge alignment to align graph embeddings with the natural language space through multi-task contrastive learning. Then, we propose structural instruction tuning to guide LLMs in performing structure-aware reasoning over KGs, using a unified graph instruction combined with a lightweight knowledge adapter. Experimental results on two KGC tasks across four benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in the link prediction task with improvements ranging from 8.7% to 29.8%.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs), as essential ingredients in many real-world applications, always contain a considerable number of errors. KG error detection aims to find the triples whose head entity, tail entity, and corresponding relation are mismatched. Despite being urgently needed, existing KG error detection methods lack generalizability. They mainly utilize supervised information such as entity type or erroneous labels, but such information is not often available in the real world. The challenges in detecting errors in KGs are twofold. Firstly, KGs exhibit unique data characteristics that distinguish them from general graphs. Secondly, real-world KGs tend to be large, and labels are often scarce. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel KG error detection framework based on triple embedding, termed TripleNet. TripleNet constructs a triple network by treating each triple as a node and connecting them via shared entities. It then employs a Bi-LSTM module to capture intra-triple translational information at the local level and uses a graph attention network to gather inter-triple contextual information at the global level. Finally, it computes the suspicious score of each triple by integrating its local and global-level information. Experimental results on two real-world KGs demonstrated that TripleNet outperforms state-of-the-art error detection algorithms with comparable or even better efficiency.",

To obtain the crucial negative samples in contrastive learning, the CMHN model employs three negative sampling strategies (in-batch, previous-batch, and self-negative sampling), using these samples at both the sequence and entity levels for contrastive examples. Experiments demonstrate that the CMHN model outperforms comparative algorithms in terms of accuracy in tail entity prediction and the explainability of multi-hop inference paths.",

      "abstract": "Inductive relation prediction, an important task for knowledge graph completion, is to predict the relations between entities that are unseen at the training stage. The latest methods use pre-trained language models (PLMs) to encode the paths between the head entity and tail entity, and achieve state-of-the-art prediction performance. However, these methods cannot handle no-path scenarios well and lack the capability to learn comprehensive relation representations for distinguishing different relations. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Relation-aware knowledge reasoning model entitled Raker which introduces an adaptive reasoning information extraction method to identify relation-aware reasoning neighbors of entities in the target triple to handle no-path scenarios, and enables the PLM to better distinguish different relations via the relation-specific soft prompting. Raker is evaluated on three public datasets and achieves SOTA performance in inductive relation prediction when compared with the baseline methods. Notably, the absolute improvement of Raker is even more than 5% on the FB15k-237 dataset in the inductive setting. Moreover, Raker also demonstrates the superiority in transductive, few-shot, and unseen relations settings. The code of Raker is available at https://github.com/ADMIS-TONGJI/Raker.",

Given the recent advances in event-driven Information Extraction (IE), and that prior research on graph-to-text only focused on entity-driven KGs, this paper focuses on event-centric data. However, our data generation system can still be adapted to other other types of KG data. Existing large-scale datasets in the graph-to-text area are non-parallel, meaning there is a large disconnect between the KGs and text. The datasets that have a paired KG and text, are small scale and manually generated or generated without a rich ontology, making the corresponding graphs sparse. Furthermore, these datasets contain many unlinked entities between their KG and text pairs. EventNarrative consists of approximately 230,000 graphs and their corresponding natural language text, 6 times larger than the current largest parallel dataset. It makes use of a rich ontology, all of the KGs entities are linked to the text, and our manual annotations confirm a high data quality. Our aim is two-fold: help break new ground in event-centric research where data is lacking, and to give researchers a well-defined, large-scale dataset in order to better evaluate existing and future knowledge graph-to-text models. We also evaluate two types of baseline on EventNarrative: a graph-to-text specific model and two state-of-the-art language models, which previous work has shown to be adaptable to the knowledge graph-to-text domain.",

A crucial aspect is embedding techniques that coverts the high-dimensional discrete features, such as user and item IDs, into low-dimensional continuous vectors and can enhance the recommendation performance. Applying embedding techniques captures complex entity relationships and has spurred substantial research. In this survey, we provide an overview of the recent literature on embedding techniques in recommender systems. This survey covers embedding methods like collaborative filtering, self-supervised learning, and graph-based techniques. Collaborative filtering generates embeddings capturing user-item preferences, excelling in sparse data. Self-supervised methods leverage contrastive or generative learning for various tasks. Graph-based techniques like node2vec exploit complex relationships in network-rich environments. Addressing the scalability challenges inherent to embedding methods, our survey delves into innovative directions within the field of recommendation systems. These directions aim to enhance performance and reduce computational complexity, paving the way for improved recommender systems. Among these innovative approaches, we will introduce Auto Machine Learning (AutoML), hash techniques, and quantization techniques in this survey. We discuss various architectures and techniques and highlight the challenges and future directions in these aspects. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in this rapidly evolving field and serve as a useful resource for researchers and practitioners working in the area of recommender systems.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) constitute an indispensable corpus of structured knowledge, underpinning a plethora of analytical applications, notably in the realms of machine learning, data mining, and artificial intelligence research. The field of Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) is dedicated to the cognitive endeavor of extrapolating from extant (empirically ascertained) data points to deduce the elusive (non-evident) relational linkages, thereby augmenting the comprehensiveness and fidelity of the KG’s informational architecture. Numerous contemporary scholarly contributions have emphasized the utility of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) in the domain of Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC). These networks demonstrate a profound capability for representation learning with respect to graph-structured data, consequently yielding commendable outcomes in the field. In the GCN-based architecture, the aggregation procedure plays an important role, and consequently the caliber of the chosen neighboring entities, with the adaptability to diverse data, exerts a significant influence on the efficacy of the entire algorithm. While these lines of aggregation functions used in conventional GCN-based KGC model, are inherently straightforward and intuitive, they are limited in their capacity to dynamically adapt to diverse tasks and datasets, which weakens their generalization ability and hinders the practical application of KGs. Hence, to overcome this problem, this work proposes an optimized mechanism respect to the aggregation procedure, with help of neighboring prompt from the neighboring entities as well as neighboring relations. The primary rationale underpinning the proposed aggregation’s superiority lies in its utilization of prompt information derived from the task-specific datasets, which enables it to effectively tailor its aggregation strategy to the nuances of diverse datasets. Hence, this inherent adaptability markedly amplifies the model’s versatility and its representational power. This study demonstrates that modest alterations and enhancements to the architecture of the underlying network, incorporating the previously mentioned modules, can significantly enhance the performance of conventional GCN-based models. Consequently, the present manuscript introduces a readily implementable plug-in module that can be integrated into existing GCN-based KGC architectures. This addition is designed to augment the intrinsic performance of the native models.",

The primary obstacle in this task stems from the inherent incompleteness of KGs. Existing research has predominantly focused on addressing the issue of missing edges in KGs, thereby neglecting another aspect of incompleteness: the emergence of new entities. Furthermore, most of the existing methods tend to reason over each logical operator separately, rather than comprehensively analyzing the query as a whole during the reasoning process. In this paper, we propose a query-aware prompt-fused framework named Pro-QE, which could incorporate existing query embedding methods and address the embedding of emerging entities through contextual information aggregation. Additionally, a query prompt, which is generated by encoding the symbolic query, is introduced to gather information relevant to the query from a holistic perspective. To evaluate the efficacy of our model in the inductive setting, we introduce two new challenging benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our model successfully handles the issue of unseen entities in logical queries. Furthermore, the ablation study confirms the efficacy of the aggregator and prompt components.",

      "abstract": "Different from traditional knowledge graphs, where facts are usually represented as (subject, relation, object), hyper-relational knowledge graphs (HKGs) allow facts to be associated with additional relation-entity pairs to constrain the validity of facts. HKGs contain a substantial amount of textual information, which plays a crucial role in enriching representations. However, existing HKG embedding methods mainly rely on structural information but overlook textual information in HKGs, which are less effective in representing entities with limited structural information. To address this issue, the paper proposes HIST (Hyper-relational Knowledge Graph Encoder Integrating Structure and Text), which incorporates textual information and structural information in HKGs to enhance representations of entities and relations. HIST adopts the graph convolutional network to extract structural information and utilizes it to generate the Structure Soft Prompt. During the Structure Soft Prompt Tuning process, the textual information and structural information are fully integrated to generate more comprehensive representations. Additionally, an effective contrastive learning method for HKG embedding is formulated to improve the efficiency of negative sampling.

Structure-based methods effectively represent relational facts in knowledge graphs using entity embeddings and description-based methods leverage pre-trained language models (PLMs) to understand textual information. In this paper, we propose Momentum Contrast for knowledge graph completion with Structure-Augmented pre-trained language models (MoCoSA), which allows the PLM to perceive the structural information by the adaptable structure encoder. We proposed momentum hard negative and intra-relation negative sampling to improve learning efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of mean reciprocal rank (MRR), with improvements of 2.5% on WN18RR and 21% on OpenBG500.",

      "abstract": "In conversational recommender systems (CRSs), conversations usually involve a set of items and item-related entities or attributes, e.g., director is a related entity of a movie. These items and item-related entities are often mentioned along the development of a dialog, leading to potential sequential dependencies among them. However, most of existing CRSs neglect these potential sequential dependencies. In this article, we first propose a Transformer-based sequential conversational recommendation method, named TSCR, to model the sequential dependencies in the conversations to improve CRS. In TSCR, we represent conversations by items and the item-related entities, and construct user sequences to discover user preferences by considering both the mentioned items and item-related entities. Based on the constructed sequences, we deploy a Cloze task to predict the recommended items along a sequence. Meanwhile, in certain domains, knowledge graphs formed by the items and their related entities are readily available, which provide various different kinds of associations among them. Given that TSCR does not benefit from such knowledge graphs, we then propose a knowledge graph enhanced version of TSCR, called TSCRKG. In specific, we leverage the knowledge graph to offline initialize our model TSCRKG, and augment the user sequence of conversations (i.e., sequence of the mentioned items and item-related entities in the conversation) with multi-hop paths in the knowledge graph. Experimental results demonstrate that our TSCR model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, and the enhanced version TSCRKG further improves recommendation performance on top of TSCR.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have found many applications in industrial and in academic settings, which in turn, have motivated considerable research efforts towards large-scale information extraction from a variety of sources. Despite such efforts, it is well known that even the largest KGs suffer from incompleteness; Link Prediction (LP) techniques address this issue by identifying missing facts among entities already in the KG. Among the recent LP techniques, those based on KG embeddings have achieved very promising performance in some benchmarks. Despite the fast-growing literature on the subject, insufficient attention has been paid to the effect of the design choices in those methods. Moreover, the standard practice in this area is to report accuracy by aggregating over a large number of test facts in which some entities are vastly more represented than others; this allows LP methods to exhibit good results by just attending to structural properties that include such entities, while ignoring the remaining majority of the KG. This analysis provides a comprehensive comparison of embedding-based LP methods, extending the dimensions of analysis beyond what is commonly available in the literature. We experimentally compare the effectiveness and efficiency of 18 state-of-the-art methods, consider a rule-based baseline, and report detailed analysis over the most popular benchmarks in the literature.",

      "abstract": "Schema information is increasingly crucial to improve service discovery, recommendation, and composition, addressing link sparsity and lack of explainability inherent in methods relying solely on triples. However, existing approaches predominantly utilize schema information as a rigid filtering mechanism, equivalent to fixed conditions that lack the capability to adaptively adjust based on model learning. This paper introduces a novel learnable schema-aware knowledge embedding framework that enhances service link prediction by synergizing entity, relation, and type embeddings through a coupled matrix-tensor factorization model. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that couples entity and relation embeddings to enable adaptive learning of Schema Embeddings (SchemaE). Our framework is both expressive and easy to use, with the capability to generalize to existing bilinear models. Within this framework, we further propose the schema prompt method for embedding isolated nodes, which typically suffer from sparse relations or the absence of neighbors, leading to biased representation often overlooked in existing works. Despite embedding schema information, our model remains lightweight due to the introduction of a parameter-efficient strategy via type assists. We conduct extensive experiments on four public datasets, including comparisons with existing SOTA models, parameter analysis, performance validation on extended models, and visualization. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) embedding aims to encode both entities and relations into a continuous vector space. Most existing methods require that all entities should be observed during training while ignoring the evolving nature of KG. Major recent efforts on this issue embed new entities by aggregating neighborhood information from existing entities and relations with Graph Neural Network (GNN). However, these methods rely on the neighbors seen during training and suffer from the embedding of new entities with insufficient triplets or triplets with the unseen-to-unseen form. To relieve this problem, we propose a two-stage learning model referred as Hyper-Relation Feature Learning Network (HRFN) for effective out-of-knowledge-base embedding. For the first stage, HRFN learns pre-representations for emerging entities using hyper-relation features meta-learned from the training set. A novel feature aggregating network that involves an entity-centered Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and a relation-centered GCN is proposed to aggregate information from both new entities themselves and their neighbors. For stage two, a transductive learning network is employed to learn finer-grained embeddings based on above-mentioned pre-representations of new entities. Experimental results on the link prediction task demonstrate the superiority of our model. Further analysis is also done to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of pre-representing emerging entities with the hyper-relation feature.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, dynamic knowledge graph embedding (DKGE) has been widely studied to deal with large-scale dynamic knowledge graphs (DKG). The core idea is to encode dynamic information within DKGs into embedding vectors and decode them for various downstream tasks on the DKGs. Plenty of contributions have been made to this field. Full retraining DKG models additionally encode temporal information for higher performance, while neighboring retraining models view time data as dynamic changes in graph topology for better efficiency. However, existing approaches within these categories suffer from either effectiveness-insufficient or efficiency-insufficient issues. Recent contributions in graph area propose solutions to selectively retrain the models by choosing training data following certain criteria, but the majority of selective retraining models are designed for homogeneous graphs. The heterogeneous graph information and large graph sizes make it improper to transfer methods across scenarios. In this paper, we propose an efficient selective incremental training framework for DKGE, namely SIT. Given a restriction on training data size, we select a set of important triples instead of all triples in the DKG to improve training efficiency. In detail, we design a novel importance criteria considering DKGE model parameters, historical embedding and graph topology. Extensive experiments on open-source datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the SIT framework against different DKGE models.",

The proposed method not only considers the structural details of the triplet but also integrates additional relevant information, such as relational path, text description, and entity hierarchical type. The proposed method effectively utilizes these multiple sources of information to improve the expressiveness and generalization of knowledge representation.

      "abstract": "Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) reasoning often involves completing missing factual elements along the timeline. Although existing methods can learn good embeddings for each factual element in quadruples by integrating temporal information, they often fail to infer the evolution of temporal facts. This is mainly because of (1) insufficiently exploring the internal structure and semantic relationships within individual quadruples and (2) inadequately learning a unified representation of the contextual and temporal correlations among different quadruples. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Transformer-based reasoning model (dubbed ECEformer) for TKG to learn the Evolutionary Chain of Events (ECE). Specifically, we unfold the neighborhood subgraph of an entity node in chronological order, forming an evolutionary chain of events as the input for our model. Subsequently, we utilize a Transformer encoder to learn the embeddings of intra-quadruples for ECE. We then craft a mixed-context reasoning module based on the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to learn the unified representations of inter-quadruples for ECE while accomplishing temporal knowledge reasoning. In addition, to enhance the timeliness of the events, we devise an additional time prediction task to complete effective temporal information within the learned unified representation. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets verify the state-of-the-art performance and the effectiveness of our method.",

Although this shared mapping matrix considers the suitability of all triplets, it neglects the specificity of each triplet. To solve this problem, we dynamically learn one information distributor for each triplet to exchange its specific information. In this paper, we propose a novel Triplet Distributor Network (TDN) for the knowledge graph completion task. Specifically, we adaptively learn one Triplet Distributor (TD) for each triplet to assist the interaction between the entity and relation. Furthermore, on the basis of TD, we creatively design the information exchange layer to dynamically propagate the information of the entity and relation, thus mutually enhancing entity and relation representations. Except for several commonly-used knowledge graph datasets, we still implement the link prediction task on the social-relational and medical datasets to test the proposed method.

Previous methods are limited to transductive scenarios, where entities exist in the knowledge graphs, so they are unable to handle unseen entities. Therefore, recent inductive methods utilize the sub-graphs around unseen entities to obtain the semantics and predict links inductively. However, in the few-shot setting, the sub-graphs are often sparse and cannot provide meaningful inductive patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel relational anonymous walk-guided neural process for few-shot inductive link prediction on knowledge graphs, denoted as RawNP. Specifically, we develop a neural process-based method to model a flexible distribution over link prediction functions. This enables the model to quickly adapt to new entities and estimate the uncertainty when making predictions. To capture general inductive patterns, we present a relational anonymous walk to extract a series of relational motifs from few-shot observations. These motifs reveal the distinctive semantic patterns on KGs that support inductive predictions. Extensive experiments on typical benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model derives new state-of-the-art performance.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) are an efficient method for representing heterogeneous knowledge. In KGs, knowledge is represented as triples and transformed into a low-dimensional space using graph embedding techniques, benefiting downstream tasks such as recommender systems and question answering. In real-world scenarios, knowledge graphs are continuously updated with new facts. However, existing KG embedding models only support static graph embeddings, requiring the re-training of the entire graph whenever knowledge updates occur, resulting in time-consuming. There are limited models that support dynamic embedding, which utilizes already trained embeddings to generate representations of new data to improve embedding efficiency. However, these models often ignore the semantic information inherent in the new data itself and the unique structural information in the KG, resulting in low embedding quality. To address this issue, we propose an embedding method specifically designed for dynamic knowledge graphs. Initially, we obtain the semantic representation by quantifying the descriptive information of the added nodes as an initialization vector. Next, to ensure compliance with the graph structure in the KG, we leverage the triple structure of neighboring nodes to the new nodes, and iteratively train the semantic representation to satisfy the structural constraints of KG, resulting in an embedding vector that incorporates both semantic and structural information. We compare our model with existing KG embedding models on two benchmark datasets in link prediction task. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves higher efficiency while maintaining the same level of accuracy, thereby validating its effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "\n Multilingual knowledge graph completion predicts missing facts in the target language knowledge graph by learning and inferring knowledge and rules in other language knowledge graphs. Existing methods tend to use aligned entities between knowledge graphs in different languages as alignment seeds, and receive information from them through alignment seeds to promote entity alignment between different knowledge graphs. However, these methods only consider the local structural information of the knowledge graph by aggregating entity neighborhood information through aligned entities, and ignore the global structural information. At the same time, the methods aboved are hardly to learn the entity representation with sparse neighborhood in isolated subgraphs. To address these two problems, this paper proposes a multilingual knowledge graph completion method based on double-branch graph neural network and self-supervised entity alignment (DBGNN-SSL). The global and local topological structures of the knowledge graph are learned through a double-branch graph attention neural network, and more aligned entities can be iteratively generated through self-supervised learning. The experimental results on datasets DBP-5L and E-PKG verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

The proposed CPa-WAC method reduces the training time and memory cost of knowledge graph embedding, making the learning model scalable. The results from our experiments on standard databases, such as Wordnet and Freebase, show that by achieving meaningful partitioning, any knowledge graph can be broken down into subgraphs and processed separately to learn embeddings. Furthermore, these learned embeddings can be used for knowledge graph completion, retaining similar performance compared to training a GCN on the whole KG, while speeding up the training process by upto five times. Additionally, the proposed CPa-WAC method outperforms several other state-of-the-art KG in terms of prediction accuracy.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, MKR has attracted increasing attention due to its ability to enhance the accuracy of recommendation systems through cooperation between the RS tasks and the KGE tasks, allowing for complementarity of the information. However, there are still three challenging issues: historical behavior preferences, missing data, and knowledge graph completion. To tackle these challenging problems, we propose MDAR, a multi-task learning approach that combines DeepFM with an attention mechanism (DeepAFM) and a relation-fused multi-head graph attention network (RMGAT). Firstly, we propose to leverage the attention mechanism in the DeepAFM to distinguish the importance of different features for target prediction by assigning different weights to different interaction features of the user and the item, which solves the first problem. Secondly, we introduce deep neural networks (DNNs) to extract the deep semantic information in the cross-compressed units by obtaining the high-dimensional features of the interactions between the RS task and the KG task to solve the second problem. Lastly, we design a multi-head graph attention network for relationship fusion (RMGAT) in the KGE task, which learns entity representations through the different contributions of the neighbors by aggregating the relationships into the attention network of the knowledge graph and by obtaining information about the neighbors with different importance for different relationships, effectively solving the third problem. Through experimenting on real-world public datasets, we demonstrate that MDAR obtained substantial results over state-of-the-art baselines for recommendations for movie, book, and music datasets. Our results underscore the effectiveness of MDAR and its potential to advance recommendation systems in various domains.",

      "abstract": "Multilingual Knowledge Graph Completion (mKGC) aim at solving queries like (h, r, ?) in different languages by reasoning a tail entity t thus improving multilingual knowledge graphs. Previous studies leverage multilingual pretrained language models (PLMs) and the generative paradigm to achieve mKGC. Although multilingual pretrained language models contain extensive knowledge of different languages, its pretraining tasks cannot be directly aligned with the mKGC tasks. Moreover, the majority of KGs and PLMs currently available exhibit a pronounced English-centric bias. This makes it difficult for mKGC to achieve good results, particularly in the context of low-resource languages. To overcome previous problems, this paper introduces global and local knowledge constraints for mKGC. The former is used to constrain the reasoning of answer entities, while the latter is used to enhance the representation of query contexts. The proposed method makes the pretrained model better adapt to the mKGC task. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous SOTA on Hits@1 and Hits@10 by an average of 12.32% and 16.03%, which indicates that our proposed method has significant enhancement on mKGC.",

      "abstract": "Due to regulations like the Right to be Forgotten, there is growing demand for removing training data and its influence from models. Since full retraining is costly, various machine unlearning methods have been proposed. In this paper, we firstly present an efficient knowledge graph (KG) unlearning algorithm. We remark that KG unlearning is nontrivial due to the distinctive structure of KG and the semantic relations between entities. Also, unlearning by estimating the influence of removed components incurs significant computational overhead when applied to large-scale knowledge graphs. To this end, we define an influence function for KG unlearning and propose to approximate the model's sensitivity without expensive computation of first-order and second-order derivatives for parameter updates. Specifically, we use Taylor expansion to estimate the parameter changes caused by data removal. Given that the first-order gradients and second-order derivatives dominate the computational load, we use the Fisher matrices and zeroth-order optimization to approximate the inverse-Hessian vector product without constructing the computational graphs. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art graph unlearning baselines significantly in terms of unlearning efficiency and unlearning quality.

In each network slice, to precisely control the service quality and cost, deploying the service-required virtual network functions (VNFs) by utilizing the linkage between the characteristics of this slicing task and the characteristics of different servers in the B5G network is essential. Therefore, aiming at gaining the ability of learning and adapting new tasks quickly and cost effectively, we view the NFV deployment problem as a meta relational learning process that explores the meta mapping relation between service-tailored slicing tasks and the B5G physical network and propose a service-tailored VNF deployment framework, abbreviated as StailNet. Instead of training a one-strategy-fits-all deployment model, we focus on “learning” how to train a deployment model and propose to learn the features of servers and slicing tasks from the perspective of knowledge graph-based representation learning, then locate the initial meta mapping relation by extracting meta information in the task-agnostic meta space and exploring the service-tailored meta mapping relation in the task space for each task, so that we can quickly obtain the solution by a few gradients on the initial meta mapping relation. To highlight the performances of StailNet, we do comprehensive simulations. Simulation results demonstrate that our StailNet outperforms the selected representative algorithms in the literature.",

The adverse effects of DDI are closely determined by the molecular structures of the drugs involved. To represent drug data effectively, researchers usually treat the molecular structure of drugs as a molecule graph. Then, previous studies can use the handcrafted graph neural network (GNN) model to learn the molecular graph representations of drugs for DDI prediction. However, in the field of bioinformatics, manually designing GNN architectures for specific molecular structure datasets is time-consuming and depends on expert experience. To address this problem, we propose an automatic drug–drug interaction prediction method named AutoDDI that can efficiently and automatically design the GNN architecture for drug–drug interaction prediction without manual intervention. To this end, we first design an effective search space for drug–drug interaction prediction by revisiting various handcrafted GNN architectures. Then, to efficiently and automatically design the optimal GNN architecture for each drug dataset from the search space, a reinforcement learning search algorithm is adopted. The experiment results show that AutoDDI can achieve the best performance on two real-world datasets. Moreover, the visual interpretation results of the case study show that AutoDDI can effectively capture drug substructure for drug–drug interaction prediction.",

In this study, we apply adaptive negative sampling to the classical knowledge graph embedding model transE. We have performed optimization on the loss function while preserving the fundamental principles of embedding. As a result, our model is referred to as ANStransE.

While MMEA has made significant progress, prevailing methods still heavily rely on abundant annotated entity pairs. Active learning seeks to alleviate the labeling burden or enhance model efficiency within fixed labeling capacity through careful sample selection. However, active learning for entity alignment in multimodal scenarios remains unexplored. In our view, it is crucial that data selected from different modalities should complement each other without redundancy or overlap; otherwise, the obtained data may prove a waste of labeling budgets. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel acquisition function leveraging Graph Neural Networks’ (GNNs) capability to aggregate information over multiple hops, prioritizing data distant from other modalities’ selections. Moreover, existing approaches employ data augmentation by selecting entity pairs whose inter-entity similarities of other modalities exceed a predefined threshold, but this augmentation strategy inadequately capitalizes on the available similarity information among entities. We can further enhance performance by integrating similarity matrices from different modalities. Consequently, our method achieves considerable improvements over existing active learning methods for entity alignment, as demonstrated by the experiments.",

Previously developed methods based on knowledge graph embedding (KGE) and graph neural networks (GNNs) focusing on instance-level KGs are confronted with challenges of data scarcity and model simplicity, rendering them inapplicable to reasoning tasks in few-shot scenarios. To tackle these issues, we propose a multi-view few-shot KG reasoning method for emerging entities. The primary focus of our method lies in resolving the problem of link prediction for emerging entities with limited associated triples from multiple perspectives. Distinct from previous methods, our approach initially abstracts a concept-view KG from the conventional instance-view KG, enabling the formulation of commonsense rules. Additionally, we employ the aggregation of multi-hop subgraph features to enhance the representation of emerging entities. Furthermore, we introduce a more efficient cross-domain negative sampling strategy and a multi-view triple scoring function based on commonsense rules. Our experimental evaluations highlight the effectiveness of our method in few-shot contexts, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability in both cross-shot and zero-shot scenarios, significantly outperforming existing models in these challenging settings.",

      "abstract": "Query embedding (QE) is designed to embed entities and first-order logic (FOL) queries in low-dimensional spaces, it has demonstrated considerable effectiveness in multi-hop reasoning over knowledge graphs. Recently, the practice of embedding entities and queries using geometric shapes has emerged as a promising approach, given the natural ability of these shapes to represent query answer sets and the logical relationships between them. However, existing geometry-based models, such as those employing point and box embeddings, cannot handle logical negation operations. Additionally, these models typically focus only on entities and relations, overlooking the rich semantic information available in knowledge graphs. To address these limitations, we propose the Type-aware Enhanced Cylinder Embedding (TECE) model. This model leverages three-dimensional geometric representations, integrating entity relationship type information. TECE covers a spectrum of essential First-Order Logic (FOL) operations, such as conjunctive, disjunctive, and negative. TECE improves the representation of entities and relationships in queries by incorporating semantic information. Moreover, it strengthens the model’s ability in generalization, along with deductive and inductive reasoning. Our experiment results demonstrate that TECE achieves significantly superior performance compared with existing SOTA methods on standard datasets.",

      "abstract": "Semantic context surrounding a triplet $(h, r, t)$ is crucial for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), providing vital cues for prediction. However, traditional node-based message passing mechanisms, when applied to knowledge graphs, often introduce noise and suffer from information dilution or over-smoothing by indiscriminately aggregating information from all neighboring edges. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic-aware relational message passing. A core innovation of this framework is the introduction of a semantic-aware Top-K neighbor selection strategy. Specifically, this strategy first evaluates the semantic relevance between a central node and its incident edges within a shared latent space, selecting only the Top-K most pertinent ones. Subsequently, information from these selected edges is effectively fused with the central node's own representation using a multi-head attention aggregator to generate a semantically focused node message. In this manner, our model not only leverages the structure and features of edges within the knowledge graph but also more accurately captures and propagates the contextual information most relevant to the specific link prediction task, thereby effectively mitigating interference from irrelevant information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing approaches on several established benchmarks.",

This surge in interest prompts us to question the fundamental impact of negative sampling: Does negative sampling really matter? Is there a general framework that can incorporate all negative sampling methods? In what fields is it applied? Addressing these questions, we propose a general framework that using negative sampling. Delving into the history of negative sampling, we chart its evolution across five distinct trajectories. We dissect and categorize the strategies used to select negative sample candidates, detailing global, local, mini-batch, hop, and memory-based approaches. Our comprehensive review extends to an analysis of current negative sampling methodologies, systematically grouping them into five classifications: static, hard, GAN-based, Auxiliary-based, and In-batch. Beyond detailed categorization, we explore the practical application of negative sampling across various fields. Finally, we briefly discuss open problems and future directions for negative sampling.",

      "abstract": "Location prediction acts as a fundamental service in today's location-based information platform, which helps users access locations satisfying their demands, improving both user experience and platform profit. Since users with unambiguous demands prefer specific locations while users with compound demands consider first regions and then specific locations, it is necessary to model multi-grained user preferences at different geographical scales. However, most of the existing works concentrate on user preferences at the location-scale only, which can not understand users traveling behaviors thoroughly. In this paper, we propose to model both the fine-grained user preferences at the location scale and the coarsegrained user preferences at the region scale. Specifically, the proposed model harnesses the efficient information extraction power of graph neural networks. Moreover, the proposed geographical calibration method also helps to capture multi-grained user preferences accurately. Experiments on datasets of two very large cities demonstrate the significant performance improvement using our approach over state-of-the-art models. We also conduct experiments to further demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in the proposed model.

      "abstract": "In research on knowledge graph representation learning, most of the existing methods use shallow linear models when extracting explicit features, while deep nonlinear models are preferred when extracting implicit features. Although the shallow linear model can learn explicit features, the effect of implicit feature extraction is limited, while the deep nonlinear model can learn implicit features, but it is easy to lead to problems such as too many parameters, overfitting, and loss of explicit features. Aiming at the above problems, this paper proposes a new feature extraction frame-work--- JointMC, which highlights entity-related features through semantic spatial mapping and combines one- and two-dimensional convolutional networks to extract explicit and implicit features in the knowledge graph. JointMC adopts a semantic spatial mapping model to learn the semantic information of the entity, filters irrelevant features, and highlights the features that are closely related to the entity. It then combines the semantic spatial representation with 1D and 2D convolutional networks to extract explicit and implicit features in the knowledge graph. Spatial mapping is combined with 1D and 2D convolutional networks to extract implicit and explicit features. Experimental com-parisons with several models confirm the good performance of JointMC in the link prediction task.",

With the development of knowledge graphs and representation, many works have also begun utilizing external knowledge to improve performance. To explore how multi-modal information and knowledge are utilized, this paper provides a comprehensive survey on multi-modal knowledge representation, which has never been systematically discussed. To facilitate the discussion of how the models combine and utilize multi-modal information and knowledge, we categorize multi-modal knowledge representation methods into two frameworks: explicit multi-modal knowledge representation and implicit multi-modal knowledge representation. For each framework, we introduce some typical models in vision-and-Ianguage, to help new researchers in this field understand the multi-modal knowledge representation model better. In addition, we introduce some downstream tasks and propose some important directions for future work.",

Recently, there are bright performance on reinforcement learning applications for path reasoning, which range from the initial reinforcement learning framework (Deeppath) to Bayesian reinforcement learning framework (GaussianPath) and so on. It is still being big challenges on the reduction of spurious search trajectories caused by invalid actions and the low probability of reaching positive rewards. Thus, a Gate Policy-Guided Path Reasoning (GPGPR) model framework is proposed for solving the knowledge graph completion. It mainly consists of a policy-guided graph search algorithm and a novel soft reward function. Specifically, The policy-guided graph search algorithm is implemented by a gate policy network with invalid action masking. It can filter spurious search trajectories caused by invalid actions to obtain more suitable action distributions. The novel soft reward function employs target embedding dropout mechanism to determine whether a target entity is dose to the ground truth to make higher positive rewards for obtaining the expected accumulated reward. In this experiments, we select MRR and Hits@N as metrics and conduct extensive contrast experiments between the proposed model and basdine models on open knowledge base datasets.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a recommendation model that exploits a graph augmentation technique based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to enrich the information encoded in its underlying Knowledge Graph (KG). Our work relies on the assumption that the triples encoded in a KG can often be noisy or incomplete, and this may lead to sub-optimal modeling of both the characteristics of items and the users’ preferences. In this setting, graph augmentation can be a suitable solution to improve the quality of the data model and provide users with high-quality recommendations. Accordingly, in this work, we align with this research line and propose GAL-KARS (Graph Augmentation with LLMs for Knowledge-Aware Recommender Systems). In our framework, we start from a KG, and we design some prompts for querying an LLM and augmenting the graph by incorporating: (a) further features describing the items; (b) further nodes describing the preferences of the users, obtained by reasoning over the items they like. The resulting KG is then passed through a Knowledge Graph Encoder that learns users’ and items’ embeddings based on the augmented KG. These embeddings are finally used to train a recommendation model and provide users with personalized suggestions. As shown in the experimental session, graph augmentation based on LLMs can significantly improve the predictive accuracy of our recommendation model, thus confirming the effectiveness of the model and the validity of our intuitions.",

Our method begins by instructing large language models (LLMs) to transform compact, structural triplets into context-rich segments.

Comprehensive evaluations across diverse datasets and KGC techniques highlight the efficacy and adaptability of our approach, revealing consistent performance enhancements irrespective of underlying pipelines or architectures.

      "abstract": "Existing work on knowledge graph (KG) link prediction has primarily focused on a single KG. However, a single KG is often limited by its incompleteness, encompassing missing facts, entities, and relations. This limitation subsequently restricts the practicality, as it cannot handle the queries that involve missing entities or relations within the single KG. In this article, we explore an extended link prediction task, cross-KG link prediction, which answers queries using entities or relations integrated from other KGs. The crux of this problem is transferring knowledge across KGs and fusing their embedding spaces, which possess varying schemata. We develop a relation prototype graph to model the interactions among relations from different KGs. Based on this graph, we first propose a dual-view embedding learning module to fuse embedding spaces by training with instance facts and relation prototype edges. We then introduce an attention mechanism to highlight pivotal information for specific queries, recognizing that different KGs often emphasize various domains. Moreover, we devise an augmentation strategy to generate pseudo-cross-KG facts, facilitating knowledge transfer across KGs. Using four widely-used KGs, we construct two cross-KG link prediction datasets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our model and the unique contributions of each module.",

This paper proposes a novel Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding (CKGE) method, which introduces a hierarchical backpropagation mechanism and a local-global distillation module to fully leverage the topological structure features of the graph and effectively mitigate the catastrophic forgetting problem.

Our approach primarily focuses on triplet extraction for the creation of knowledge graph. We employ dependency parsing techniques to extract relationships between entities, and utilize an extended version of BERT, combined with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for Named Entity Recognition (NER). The proposed Agriculture knowledge graph covers significant areas of the agricultural domain by focusing on six major entities: soil, place, disease, pathogen, pesticide, and crops, along with their intra and inter-relationships. There is no benchmark dataset in the agriculture domain encompassing all the major entities. Hence we create our own corpus comprises 30k sentences sourced from reputable agriculture websites. To evaluate the effectiveness of our triplet extraction model, we utilized a test corpus containing 3500 agriculture triplets. Based on the experimental results, we were able to achieve an average macro F-score of 87% for relation extraction, indicating the efficacy of our approach. Additionally, we created an Agriculture knowledge graph using a triplet corpus of 6236 triplets. We also analyzed various knowledge graph reasoning models that improve the discovery of implicit knowledge that is not explicitly represented in the knowledge graph. Experimental results indicate that our approach is effective in creating triplets and reasoning knowledge graphs for the agricultural domain.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) is attracting growing research interest because it offers great flexibility for the manipulation and application of Knowledge Graphs (KGs). However, most existing works focus on static KGE, while temporal KGE is still in its infancy. Recent temporal KGE methods attempt to obtain the long-term dependency of facts in consecutive timestamps by merging historical fact information. However, they ignore the different impacts of historical facts on the current facts due to the time decay effect and heterogeneity of historical facts. To bridge this gap, we formalize the concept of fact formation sequence to describe the evolution of an entity and propose the Modeling Time Decay Effect in Temporal Knowledge Graphs via Multivariate Hawkes Process method (TimeDE). TimeDE uses the Hawkes process to model the time decay effect of historical facts. It also incorporates the attention mechanism based on the score function of static KGE methods to better capture the impacts of heterogeneous historical facts on the current facts. Extensive experiments on the five commonly-used benchmark datasets demonstrate that TimeDE achieves significant improvements in terms of both Mean Reciprocal Rank and Hits@K compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

It allows one training to obtain a croppable KGE model for multiple scenarios with different dimensional needs. Sub-models of required dimensions can be directly cropped and used without extra training. In MED, we propose a mutual learning mechanism to improve the low-dimensional sub-models and make high-dimensional sub-models retain the low-dimensional sub-models' capacity, an evolutionary improvement mechanism to promote the high-dimensional sub-models to master the triple that the low-dimensional sub-models can not, and a dynamic loss weight to adaptively balance the multiple losses.

In this paper, we introduce KGGLM, a decoder-only Transformer model designed for generalizable knowledge representation learning to support recommendation. The model is trained on generic paths sampled from the knowledge graph to capture foundational patterns, and then fine-tuned on paths specific of the downstream step (knowledge completion and path reasoning in our case).

      "abstract": "With the proliferation of location-tracking technologies, massive volumes of trajectory data are continuously being collected. As a fundamental task in trajectory data mining, trajectory similarity computation plays a critical role in a wide range of real-world applications. However, existing learning-based methods face three challenges: First, they ignore the semantic gap between GPS and grid features in trajectories, making it difficult to obtain meaningful trajectory embeddings. Second, the noise inherent in the trajectories, as well as the noise introduced during grid discretization, obscures the true motion patterns of the trajectories. Third, existing methods focus solely on point-wise and pair-wise losses, without utilizing the global ranking information obtained by sorting all trajectories according to their similarity to a given trajectory. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel trajectory similarity computation framework, named TrajDiff. Specifically, the semantic alignment module relies on cross-attention and an attention score mask mechanism with adaptive fusion, effectively eliminating semantic discrepancies between data at two scales and generating a unified representation. Additionally, the DDBM-based Noise-robust Pre-Training introduces the transfer patterns between any two trajectories into the model training process, enhancing the model's noise robustness. Finally, the overall ranking-aware regularization shifts the model's focus from a local to a global perspective, enabling it to capture the holistic ordering information among trajectories. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets show that TrajDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. In particular, it achieves an average HR@1 gain of 33.38% across all three evaluation metrics and datasets.",

When the number of entities is larger than the model's embedding dimension, which in practical scenarios is often by several orders of magnitude, we have a linear output layer with a rank bottleneck. Such bottlenecked layers limit model expressivity. We investigate both theoretically and empirically how rank bottlenecks affect KGC models. We find that, by limiting the set of feasible predictions, rank bottlenecks hurt ranking accuracy and the distribution fidelity of scores. Inspired by the language modelling literature, we propose KGE-MoS, a mixture-based output layer to break rank bottlenecks in many KGC models. Our experiments on four datasets show that KGE-MoS improves performance and probabilistic fit of KGC models for a low parameter cost.",

Deep Neural Networks have achieved significant progress in the relation prediction task. However, most existing KGC methods focus on single features (e.g., entity IDs) and sub-graph aggregation, which cannot fully explore all the features in the Knowledge Graph (KG), and neglect the external semantic knowledge injection. To address these problems, we propose MUSE, a knowledgeaware reasoning model to learn a tailored embedding space in three dimensions for missing relation prediction through a multiknowledge representation learning mechanism. Our MUSE consists of three parallel components: 1) Prior Knowledge Learning for enhancing the triplets' semantic representation by finetuning BERT; 2) Context Message Passing for enhancing the context messages of KG; 3) Relational Path Aggregation for enhancing the path representation from the head entity to the tail entity. Our experimental results show that MUSE significantly outperforms other baselines on four public datasets, such as over 5.50% improvement in H@1 and 4.20% improvement in MRR on the NELL995 dataset.

In CNN feature maps are extracted by filters, concatenated and weighted for output scores to discern whether the original triplet holds or not. Experiments show that IEAKBC holds certain advantages over other models; when scaling up to relatively larger datasets, signs of superiority of IEAKBC stand out especially on relations with high cardinalities.

      "abstract": "The rapid development of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platforms has created an urgent need for an efficient personalized course recommender system that can assist learners of all backgrounds and levels of knowledge in selecting appropriate courses. Currently, most existing methods utilize a sequential recommendation paradigm that captures the user’s learning interests from their learning history, typically through recurrent or graph neural networks. However, fewer studies have explored how to incorporate principles of human learning at both the course and category levels to enhance course recommendations. In this article, we aim at addressing this gap by introducing a novel model, named Prerequisite-Enhanced Catory-Aware Graph Neural Network (PCGNN), for course recommendation. Specifically, we first construct a course prerequisite graph that reflects the human learning principles and further pre-train the course prerequisite relationships as the base embeddings for courses and categories. Then, to capture the user’s complex learning patterns, we build an item graph and a category graph from the user’s historical learning records, respectively: (1) the item graph reflects the course-level local learning transition patterns and (2) the category graph provides insight into the user’s long-term learning interest. Correspondingly, we propose a user interest encoder that employs a gated graph neural network to learn the course-level user interest embedding and design a category transition pattern encoder that utilizes GRU to yield the category-level user interest embedding. Finally, the two fine-grained user interest embeddings are fused to achieve precise course prediction. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PCGNN compared with other state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Numerical reasoning is pivotal in various artificial intelligence applications, such as natural language processing and recommender systems, where it involves using entities, relations, and attribute values (e.g., weight, length) to infer new factual relations (e.g., the Nile is longer than the Amazon). However, existing approaches encounter two critical challenges in modeling: (1) semantic relevance-the challenge of insufficiently capturing the necessary contextual interactions among entities, relations, and numerical attributes, often resulting in suboptimal inference; and (2) semantic ambiguity-the difficulty in accurately distinguishing ordinal relationships during numerical reasoning, which compromises the generation of high-quality samples and limits the effectiveness of contrastive learning. To address these challenges, we propose the novel Knowledge-Aware Attributes Embedding model (KAAE) for knowledge graph embeddings in numerical reasoning. Specifically, to overcome the challenge of semantic relevance, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts-Knowledge-Aware (MoEKA) Encoder, designed to integrate the semantics of entities, relations, and numerical attributes into a joint semantic space. To tackle semantic ambiguity, we implement a new ordinal knowledge contrastive learning (OKCL) strategy that generates high-quality ordinal samples from the original data with the aid of ordinal relations, capturing fine-grained semantic nuances essential for accurate numerical reasoning. Experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of KAAE across various attribute value distributions.",

In this paper, we propose a simple and novel unsupervised method for cross-language entity alignment. We utilize the deep learning multi-language encoder combined with a machine translator to encode knowledge graph text, which reduces the reliance on label data. Unlike traditional methods that only emphasize global or local alignment, our method simultaneously considers both alignment strategies. We first view the alignment task as a bipartite matching problem and then adopt the re-exchanging idea to accomplish alignment. Compared with the traditional bipartite matching algorithm that only gives one optimal solution, our algorithm generates ranked matching results which enabled many potentials downstream tasks. Additionally, our method can adapt two different types of optimization (minimal and maximal) in the bipartite matching process, which provides more flexibility. Our evaluation shows, we each scored 0.966, 0.990, and 0.996 Hits@1 rates on the DBP15K dataset in Chinese, Japanese, and French to English alignment tasks. We outperformed the state-of-the-art method in unsupervised and semi-supervised categories.

We propose to use Platt scaling and isotonic regression alongside our method. Experiments on three datasets with ground truth negatives show our contribution leads to well-calibrated models when compared to the gold standard of using negatives. We get significantly better results than the uncalibrated models from all calibration methods. We show isotonic regression offers the best the performance overall, not without trade-offs. We also show that calibrated models reach state-of-the-art accuracy without the need to define relation-specific decision thresholds.",

      "abstract": "Answering complex queries over knowledge graphs (KG) is an important yet challenging task because of the KG incompleteness issue and cascading errors during reasoning. Recent query embedding (QE) approaches to embed the entities and relations in a KG and the first-order logic (FOL) queries into a low dimensional space, answering queries by dense similarity search. However, previous works mainly concentrate on the target answers, ignoring intermediate entities' usefulness, which is essential for relieving the cascading error problem in logical query answering. In addition, these methods are usually designed with their own geometric or distributional embeddings to handle logical operators like union, intersection, and negation, with the sacrifice of the accuracy of the basic operator - projection, and they could not absorb other embedding methods to their models. In this work, we propose a Neural and Symbolic Entangled framework (ENeSy) for complex query answering, which enables the neural and symbolic reasoning to enhance each other to alleviate the cascading error and KG incompleteness. The projection operator in ENeSy could be any embedding method with the capability of link prediction, and the other FOL operators are handled without parameters. With both neural and symbolic reasoning results contained, ENeSy answers queries in ensembles. ENeSy achieves the SOTA performance on several benchmarks, especially in the setting of the training model only with the link prediction task.",

      "abstract": "Research is a fundamental process driving the advancement of human civilization, yet it demands substantial time and effort from researchers. In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has inspired researchers to explore how AI can accelerate and enhance research. To monitor relevant advancements, this paper presents a systematic review of the progress in this domain. Specifically, we organize the relevant studies into three main categories: hypothesis formulation, hypothesis validation, and manuscript publication. Hypothesis formulation involves knowledge synthesis and hypothesis generation. Hypothesis validation includes the verification of scientific claims, theorem proving, and experiment validation. Manuscript publication encompasses manuscript writing and the peer review process. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the current challenges faced in these areas, as well as potential future directions for research. Finally, we also offer a comprehensive overview of existing benchmarks and tools across various domains that support the integration of AI into the research process. We hope this paper serves as an introduction for beginners and fosters future research. Resources have been made publicly available at https://github.com/zkzhou126/AI-for-Research.",

      "abstract": "As a combination of information computing technology and the cultural field, cultural computing is gaining more attention. The knowledge graph is also gradually applied as a particular data structure in the cultural area. Based on the domain knowledge graph data of the Beijing Municipal Social Science Project “Mining and Utilization of Cultural Resources in the Ancient Capital of Beijing,” this article proposes a graph representation learning model CR-TransR that integrates cultural attributes. Through the analysis of the data in the cultural field of the ancient capital of Beijing, a cultural feature dictionary is constructed, and a domain-specific feature matrix is constructed in the form of word vector splicing. The feature matrix is used to constrain the embedding graph model TransR, and then the feature matrix and the TransR model are jointly trained to complete the embedded expression of the knowledge graph. Finally, a comparative experiment is carried out on the Beijing ancient capital cultural knowledge graph dataset and the effects of the classic graph embedding algorithms TransE, TransH, and TransR. At the same time, we try to reproduce the embedding method with the core idea of neighbor node information aggregation as the core idea, and CRTransR are compared. The experimental tasks include link prediction and triplet classification, and the experimental results show that the CRTransR model performs better.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) are of great importance to many artificial intelligence applications, but they usually suffer from the incomplete problem. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE), which aims to represent entities and relations in low-dimensional continuous vector spaces, has been proved to be a promising approach for KG completion. Traditional KGE methods only concentrate on structured triples, while paying less attention to the type information of entities. In fact, incorporating entity types into embedding learning could further improve the performance of KG completion. To this end, we propose a universal Type-augmented Knowledge graph Embedding framework (TaKE) which could utilize type features to enhance any traditional KGE models. TaKE automatically captures type features under no explicit type information supervision. And by learning different type representations of each entity, TaKE could distinguish the diversity of types specific to distinct relations. We also design a new type-constrained negative sampling strategy to construct more effective negative samples for the training process. Extensive experiments on four datasets from three real-world KGs (Freebase, WordNet and YAGO) demonstrate the merits of our proposed framework. In particular, combining TaKE with the recent tensor factorization KGE model SimplE can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the KG completion task.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) schema, which prescribes a high-level structure and semantics of a KG, is significantly helpful for KG completion and reasoning problems. Despite its usefulness, open-domain KGs do not practically have a unified and fixed schema. Existing approaches usually extract schema information using entity types from a KG where each entity e can be associated with a set of types {Te, by either heuristically taking one type for each entity or exhaustively combining the types of all entities in a fact (to get entity-typed tuples, (h_type, r, t_type) for example). However, these two approaches either overlook the role of multiple types of a single entity across different facts or introduce non-negligible noise as not all the type combinations actually support the fact, thus failing to capture the sophisticated schema information. Against this background, we study the problem of modeling hyper-relational schema, which is formulated as mixed hyper-relational tuples ({Th}, r, {Tt}, k, {Tv1},...) with two-fold hyper-relations: each type set T may contain multiple types and each schema tuple may contain multiple key-type set pairs (k, Tv). To address this problem, we propose HELIOS, a hyper-relational schema model designed to subtly learn from such hyper-relational schema tuples by capturing not only the correlation between multiple types of a single entity, but also the correlation between types of different entities and relations in a schema tuple. We evaluate HELIOS on three real-world KG datasets in different schema prediction tasks. Results show that HELIOS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hyper-relational link prediction techniques by 20.0-29.7%, and is also much more robust than baselines in predicting types and relations across different positions in a hyper-relational schema tuple.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) have shown a significant impact across many domains. However, a notable dimension disparity exists in the multimodal data within the sign language domain. Thus, methods for constructing vanilla knowledge graphs are inadequate for handling sign language data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that integrates textual, video keyframe, and motion trajectory data to construct a multimodal sign language knowledge graph (SIGN-MMKG). The SIGN-MMKG structure uniquely represents sign language words as sub-graphs combining keyframes connected by action trajectories, with textual entities consisting of sign language words and body parts, and relationships composed of seven-dimensional attributes. Building upon this knowledge graph, we develop an innovative knowledge embedding model. Our method employs CLIP for text-image alignment and introduces a multimodal enhanced objective function that integrates multimodal. This approach enables the model to simultaneously learn logical relationships between multimodal data and structural relationships within the SIGN-MMKG. To our knowledge, this represents the first MMKG and embedding model specifically designed for sign language. We conducted extensive experiments on the proposed SIGN-MMKG, comparing five text-only and four text-image knowledge graph embedding (KGE) methods with our novel approach, to evaluate the performance of our proposed method. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines significantly.",

      "abstract": "Understanding user intentions is essential for improving product recommendations, navigation suggestions, and query reformulations. However, user intentions can be intricate, involving multiple sessions and attribute requirements connected by logical operators such as And, Or, and Not. For instance, a user may search for Nike or Adidas running shoes across various sessions, with a preference for purple. In another example, a user may have purchased a mattress in a previous session and is now looking for a matching bed frame without intending to buy another mattress. Existing research on session understanding has not adequately addressed making product or attribute recommendations for such complex intentions. In this paper, we present the task of logical session complex query answering (LS-CQA), where sessions are treated as hyperedges of items, and we frame the problem of complex intention understanding as an LS-CQA task on an aggregated hypergraph of sessions, items, and attributes. This is a unique complex query answering task with sessions as ordered hyperedges. We also introduce a new model, the Logical Session Graph Transformer (LSGT), which captures interactions among items across different sessions and their logical connections using a transformer structure. We analyze the expressiveness of LSGT and prove the permutation invariance of the inputs for the logical operators. By evaluating LSGT on three datasets, we demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art results.",

To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel knowledge representation learning method based on entity distance classification. This method classifies entities based on their semantic distance on a specific relational plane, and employs different training strategies to increase the training opportunities for entities with low semantic distance differentiation. Moreover, the loss function is adjusted by introducing different residual weights, which allows for the allocation of different training opportunities to negative samples. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by comparing it with mainstream knowledge representation models on various benchmark datasets.",

      "abstract": "Logs play a crucial role in system monitoring and debugging by recording valuable system information, including events and states. Although various methods have been proposed to detect anomalies in log sequences, they often overlook the significance of considering relations among system components, such as services and users, which can be identified from log contents. Understanding these relations is vital for detecting anomalies and their underlying causes. To address this issue, we introduce GLAD, a Graph-based Log Anomaly Detection framework designed to detect relational anomalies in system logs. GLAD incorporates log semantics, relational patterns, and sequential patterns into a unified framework for anomaly detection. Specifically, GLAD first introduces a field extraction module that utilizes prompt-based few-shot learning to identify essential fields from log contents. Then GLAD constructs dynamic log graphs for sliding windows by interconnecting extracted fields and log events parsed from the log parser. These graphs represent events and fields as nodes and their relations as edges. Subsequently, GLAD utilizes a temporal-attentive graph edge anomaly detection model for identifying anomalous relations in these dynamic log graphs. This model employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based encoder enhanced with transformers to capture content, structural and temporal features. We evaluate our proposed method11Our code is available at https://github.com/yul091/GraphLogAD on three datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of GLAD in detecting anomalies indicated by varying relational patterns.",

Specifically, we introduce a prompt graph centered with a query-related example fact as context to understand the query relation. To encode prompt graphs with the generalization ability to unseen entities and relations in queries, we first propose a unified tokenizer that maps entities and relations in prompt graphs to predefined tokens. Then, we propose two message passing neural networks to perform prompt encoding and KG reasoning, respectively. We conduct evaluation on 43 different KGs in both transductive and inductive settings. Results indicate that the proposed KG-ICL outperforms baselines on most datasets, showcasing its outstanding generalization and universal reasoning capabilities.

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Embedding aims to encode both entities and relations into a continuous low-dimensional vector space, which is crucial for knowledge-driven application scenarios. As abstract entities in knowledge graphs, concepts inherently possess unique hierarchical structures and encompass rich semantic information. Although existing methods for jointly embedding concepts and instances achieve promising performance, they still face two issues: (1) They fail to explicitly reconstruct the hierarchical tree structure of concepts in the embedding space; (2) They ignore disjoint concept pairs and overlapping concept pairs derived from concepts. In this paper, we propose a novel concept representation approach, called Hyper Spherical Cone Concept Embedding (HCCE), to explicitly model the hierarchical tree structure of concepts in the embedding space. Specifically, HCCE represents each concept as a hyperspherical cone and each instance as a vector, maintaining the anisotropy of concept embeddings. We propose two variant methods to explore the impact of embedding concepts and instances in the same or different spaces. Moreover, we design score functions for disjoint concept pairs and overlapping concept pairs, using relative position relations to incorporate them seamlessly into our geometric models. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that HCCE outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on concept-related triples and achieves competitive results on instance-related triples. The visualization of embedding results intuitively shows the hierarchical tree structure of concepts in the embedding space.",

Our work is inspired by previous findings in autoregressive transformer language models suggesting that their knowledge recall is localized to particular modules at specific token locations; we therefore ask whether factual recall in Mamba can be similarly localized. To investigate this, we conduct four lines of experiments on Mamba. First, we apply causal tracing or interchange interventions to localize key components inside Mamba that are responsible for recalling facts, revealing that specific components within middle layers show strong causal effects at the last token of the subject, while the causal effect of intervening on later layers is most pronounced at the last token of the prompt, matching previous findings on autoregressive transformers. Second, we show that rank-one model editing methods can successfully insert facts at specific locations, again resembling findings on transformer LMs. Third, we examine the linearity of Mamba's representations of factual relations. Finally we adapt attention-knockout techniques to Mamba in order to dissect information flow during factual recall. We compare Mamba directly to a similar-sized autoregressive transformer LM and conclude that despite significant differences in architectural approach, when it comes to factual recall, the two architectures share many similarities.",

To address this issue, we propose a temporal knowledge graph reasoning model based on Entity Relationship Similarity Perception, known as ERSP. This model employs the similarity measurement method to capture the similarity features of entity relationships and static attributes, and then fuses these features to generate structural representations. Finally, we provide a decoder with entity relationship representation, static attribute representation, and structural representation information to form a quadruple.

Specifically, interactive steady-state information focuses on the unique interaction patterns between entities and relations in their current combinations, while shared semantic information focuses on the common features of entities and relations across different interaction contexts. We designed three modules to perform different tasks: (a) GAERT module (Gated Attention Entity-Relation Transformer) to extract interactive steady-state information; (b) SWVD module (Semantic Weave Variational Decoder) to extract shared semantic information; (c) MsAPFE module (Multi-Scale Attention Pyramid Feature Extraction) to combine these two types of information and generate specific contextual information.

In this article, we introduce an innovative method, called PARE, which fully leverages relation paths to enhance the few-shot representation by simultaneously incorporating both neighborhood and relation path information. Inspired by the principles of information transmission, PARE directly models relation paths between entities and parameterizes the information interference within different relation paths. Through parameter learning, PARE effectively captures information propagation along relation paths while mitigating the influence of relation dependency. To preserve neighborhood information, we employ a two-step neighborhood aggregator to resolve few-shot neighbors’ ambiguity and develop a reconstruction module. By integrating the representations of relation paths and contextual neighborhoods, we achieve a comprehensive few-shot representation for two given entities. We utilize a matching processor for knowledge triplet evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PARE model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on widely-used benchmark datasets.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Drug repurposing has emerged as a effective and efficient strategy to identify new treatments for a variety of diseases. One of the most effective approaches for discovering potential new drug candidates involves the utilization of Knowledge Graphs (KGs). This review comprehensively explores some of the most prominent KGs, detailing their structure, data sources, and how they facilitate the repurposing of drugs. In addition to KGs, this paper delves into various artificial intelligence techniques that enhance the process of drug repurposing. These methods not only accelerate the identification of viable drug candidates but also improve the precision of predictions by leveraging complex datasets and advanced algorithms. Furthermore, the importance of explainability in drug repurposing is emphasized. Explainability methods are crucial as they provide insights into the reasoning behind AI-generated predictions, thereby increasing the trustworthiness and transparency of the repurposing process. We will discuss several techniques that can be employed to validate these predictions, ensuring that they are both reliable and understandable.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to infer missing information in incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs). Most previous works only consider the transductive scenario where entities are existing in KGs, which cannot work effectively for the inductive scenario containing emerging entities. Recently some graph neural network-based methods have been proposed for inductive KGC by aggregating neighborhood information to capture some uncertainty semantics from the neighboring auxiliary triples. But these methods ignore the more general relational semantics underlying all the known triples that can provide richer information to represent emerging entities so as to satisfy the inductive scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel model called CFAG, which utilizes two granularity levels of relational semantics in a coarse-grained aggregator (CG-AGG) and a fine-grained generative adversarial net (FG-GAN), for inductive KGC. The CG-AGG firstly generates entity representations with multiple semantics through a hypergraph neural network-based global aggregator and a graph neural network-based local aggregator, and the FG-GAN further enhances entity representations with specific semantics through conditional generative adversarial nets. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art models for inductive KGC.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs are knowledge bases that represent entities and relations in the objective world through graph structure, and they have a boosting effect on many artificial intelligence tasks. To facilitate the development of downstream artificial intelligence tasks, knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is proposed. It aims to express semantic information for each entity and relation in the knowledge graph within a low-dimensional space. However, when it comes to semantic hierarchy, multiple relation patterns and multi-fold relational structures in knowledge graphs, most of the existing models tend to focus on only one or two aspects, often neglecting the importance of considering all three simultaneously. Therefore, we propose a new knowledge graph embedding model, Hierarchical relation and Entity Rotation-based Multi-Feature knowledge graph Embedding (HERotMFE). Concerning hierarchical relation rotation and entity rotation, it can represent semantic hierarchy, multiple relation patterns and multi-fold relations simultaneously. Self-attention mechanism is used to learn the weights of the two-part rotation to further enhance the model’s performance.

      "abstract": "Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) utilize natural language interactions and dialog history to infer user preferences and provide accurate recommendations. Due to the limited conversation context and background knowledge, existing CRSs rely on external sources such as knowledge graphs (KGs) to enrich the context and model entities based on their interrelations. However, these methods ignore the rich intrinsic information within entities. To address this, we introduce the knowledge-enhanced entity representation learning (KERL) framework, which leverages both the KG and a pretrained language model (PLM) to improve the semantic understanding of entities for CRS. In our KERL framework, entity textual descriptions are encoded via a PLM, while a KG helps reinforce the representation of these entities. We also employ positional encoding to effectively capture the temporal information of entities in a conversation. The enhanced entity representation is then used to develop a recommender component that fuses both entity and contextual representations for more informed recommendations, as well as a dialog component that generates informative entity-related information in the response text. A high-quality KG with aligned entity descriptions is constructed to facilitate this study, namely, the Wiki Movie Knowledge Graph (WikiMKG). The experimental results show that KERL achieves state-of-the-art results in both recommendation and response generation tasks.

Unlike other existing designs, the system operates on multiple embedding spaces, which use various embedding methods and queries the embedding spaces in parallel. With the answers returned from multiple embedding spaces, the system leverages a score alignment model to adjust the answer scores and rerank the answers. Further, the system implements an algorithm to derive implicit multihop relations to handle the complexities of deep ontologies and improve multihop question answering. The system also implements a BERT-based bidirectional entity-linking model to enhance the robustness and accuracy of the entity-linking module. The system uses a joint numerical embedding model to efficiently handle numerical filtering questions. Further, it can invoke semantic agents to perform dynamic calculations autonomously. Finally, the KGQA system handles numerous chemical reaction mechanisms using semantic parsing supported by a Linked Data Fragment server. This paper evaluates the accuracy of each module within the KGQA system with a chemistry question data set.",

      "abstract": "With the increasing amount of data in various domains, knowledge graphs (KGs) have become powerful tools for representing complex and heterogeneous information in a structured way, and for extracting valuable information from knowledge graphs through embedding techniques to support downstream tasks such as recommendation and Q&A systems. Knowledge graphs consist of triples that are continuously added as knowledge is updated. However, most existing embedding models are designed for static graphs, requiring the entire model to be retrained for each update, which is time-consuming. Existing global dynamic embedding models focus on exploiting the structural and relational information of the whole graph to achieve embedding quality, resulting in reduced dynamic efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a relational clustering-based parallel space model in which knowledge from different domains is embedded in different subspaces, allowing each subspace to focus on the data characteristics of a specific domain, thereby improving the quality of knowledge. Second, the new data only affects some subspaces but not the performance of other spaces, improving the model's adaptability to dynamics. Furthermore, we employ two incremental approaches based on the type of added data to improve the efficiency of dynamic embedding while ensuring that the added data preserves the characteristics of the parallel space. The experimental results show that the dynamic embedding efficiency of our model is improved by an average of 50.3% compared to the SOTA dynamic embedding model for the link prediction task. Particularly on FB15K, our model not only improves the efficiency by 41% but also increases the accuracy by 7.5%, demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of our model.",

      "abstract": "Logical reasoning over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) for first-order logic (FOL) queries performs the query inference over KGs with logical operators, including conjunction, disjunction, existential quantification and negation, to approximate true answers in embedding spaces. However, most existing work imposes strong distributional assumptions (e.g., Beta distribution) to represent entities and queries into presumed distributional shape, which limits their expressive power. Moreover, query embeddings are challenging due to the relational complexities in multi-relational KGs (e.g., symmetry, anti-symmetry and transitivity). To bridge the gap, we propose a logical query reasoning framework, Line Embedding (LinE), for FOL queries. To relax the distributional assumptions, we introduce the logic space transformation layer, which is a generic neural function that converts embeddings from probabilistic distribution space to LinE embeddings space. To tackle multi-relational and logical complexities, we formulate neural relation-specific projections and individual logical operators to truthfully ground LinE query embeddings on logical regularities and KG factoids. Lastly, to verify the LinE embedding quality, we generate a FOL query dataset from WordNet, which richly encompasses hierarchical relations. Extensive experiments show superior reasoning sensitivity of LinE on three benchmarks against strong baselines, particularly for multi-hop relational queries and negation-related queries.",

      "abstract": "Many ontologies, i.e., Description Logic (DL) knowledge bases, have been developed to provide rich knowledge about various domains. An ontology consists of an ABox, i.e., assertion axioms between two entities or between a concept and an entity, and a TBox, i.e., terminology axioms between two concepts. Neural logical reasoning (NLR) is a fundamental task to explore such knowledge bases, which aims at answering multi-hop queries with logical operations based on distributed representations of queries and answers. While previous NLR methods can give specific entity-level answers, i.e., ABox answers, they are not able to provide descriptive concept-level answers, i.e., TBox answers, where each concept is a description of a set of entities. In other words, previous NLR methods only reason over the ABox of an ontology while ignoring the TBox. In particular, providing TBox answers enables inferring the explanations of each query with descriptive concepts, which make answers comprehensible to users and are of great usefulness in the field of applied ontology. In this work, we formulate the problem of neural logical reasoning across TBox and ABox (TA-NLR), solving which needs to address challenges in incorporating, representing, and operating on concepts. We propose an original solution named TAR for TA-NLR. Firstly, we incorporate description logic based ontological axioms to provide the source of concepts. Then, we represent concepts and queries as fuzzy sets, i.e., sets whose elements have degrees of membership, to bridge concepts and queries with entities. Moreover, we design operators involving concepts on top of fuzzy set representation of concepts and queries for optimization and inference. Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TAR for TA-NLR.",

In the knowledge fusion process, there are many situations such as the lack and chaos of a relationship, redundant entities, the isolation of some entities and knowledge fragments. How to effectively detect and process these problematic knowledge fragments is significant to the construction of a genealogy knowledge graph. In response to this problem, we propose a method for cleaning the problematic knowledge fragments in a genealogy knowledge graph. The method consists of three phases. In phase 1, we propose a method for detecting and analyzing the problematic knowledge fragments. In phase 2, we design a method for supplementing the entity-relationship of people for different error patterns and a method fusion method for the aligned entity. In phase 3, for the cleaning of isolated knowledge fragments, we propose an entity alignment method based on the father-son relationship and people’s names and a connection method of isolated knowledge fragments. Finally, we conduct experiments on a family tree dataset of the Huapu System, and the experimental results indicate the effectiveness and practicality of the method.",

To this end, an open-world view has recently been held in the literature by coupling the ability of knowledge bases to represent factual knowledge, with the abilities of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to capture high-level and contextual linguistic knowledge from large-scale text corpora. In this work, we propose a distillation framework for knowledge base completion where PLMs leverage soft labels in the form of entity and relations predictions provided by a knowledge base embedding model, while keeping their power of entity prediction over large-scale of texts. To better fit with the task of knowledge completion, we extend the traditional masked language modelling of PLMs toward predicting entities and related entities in context.

To tackle these challenges, we propose RelRec, a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to mine logical relations and satisfy users' logical requirements in personalized recommendation tasks. Specifically, the framework begins with the extraction of user-driven logical relations, followed by a rule-based logical relation mining module that integrates both semantic and structural information using the capabilities of LLMs. By uncovering higher-order logical relations, our approach effectively refines the heterogeneous graph for reasoning capacity and recommendation accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that RelRec significantly outperforms existing methods.",

      "abstract": "The rapid advancement of information technologies has significantly intensified the focus on cyberspace security across various sectors. In this evolving landscape, attackers deploy many of techniques- including exploits, weakness identification, and complex multi-step attacks- to gain unauthorized access to systems. Conversely, defenders harness insights from a variety of sources to pinpoint potential threats. Prominent public cybersecurity databases such as the Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK), Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC), Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), and Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) provide extensive data on security entities and their interrelations, playing a pivotal role in enriching the understanding of cybersecurity challenges and assisting in comprehensive defensive analyses. However, the semantic cross-analysis of these databases, crucial for identifying obscure threat patterns, remains underexploited. In this study, we amalgamate data from these disparate sources into a cohesive threat knowledge graph and introduce a novel knowledge representation learning approach, A4CKGE (ATT&CK-CAPEC-CWE-CVE-CPE Knowledge Graph Embedding). This method utilizes advanced structural and textual analytics to predict interactions among security entities such as products, vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and multi-step attack sequences, employing complex attack templates generated through a Large Language Model (LLM). Our extensive experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in effectively predicting these relationships.

      "abstract": "In the standard interaction model of clinical decision support systems, the system makes a recommendation, and the clinician decides whether to act on it. However, this model can compromise the patient-centeredness of care and the level of clinician involvement. There is scope to develop alternative interaction models, but we need methods for exploring and comparing these to assess how they may impact clinical decision-making. Through collaborating with clinical, AI safety, and HCI experts, and patient representatives, we co-designed a number of alternative human-AI interaction models for clinical decision-making. We then translated these models into ‘Wizard of Oz’ prototypes, where we created clinical scenarios and designed user interfaces with different types of AI output. In this paper, we present alternative models of human-AI interaction and illustrate how we used a co-design approach to translate them into functional prototypes that can be tested with users to explore potential impacts on clinical decision-making.",

      "abstract": "The current multi-modal knowledge graph representation learning methods only simply map multi-modal knowledge to the same vector space and then aggregate it, failing to consider the knowledge reconstruction errors after knowledge mapping. To address the above problems, we propose an Autoencoder-based Weighted Multi-modal knowledge graph Representation Learning model (AWMRL) that incorporates visual and textual multi-modal information to improve the knowledge graph representation learning based on the translation model. Specifically, AWMRL consists of two modules, i.e., the knowledge reconstruction module and the knowledge aggregation module. In the knowledge reconstruction module, we use an autoencoder to map multi-modal knowledge in a unified space, aiming at reducing the knowledge reconstruction errors. In the knowledge aggregation module, the energy function of the KG triple is redefined to improve the performance of aggregating knowledge of different modalities together. In addition, considering that the impact of knowledge of different modalities is different, the model weights the knowledge of different modalities so that each modality has a different learning contribution to the knowledge representation. Experimental results on the WN9-IMG and FB-IMG datasets show that AWMRL outperforms other baselines in link prediction and triple classification.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Efficient decision-making in earthquake emergencies plays a crucial role in ensuring individual safety, protecting personal property, and maintaining societal stability. However, traditional approaches to earthquake emergency decision-making rely on manual analysis or rule-based methods, which often struggle to fully leverage the wealth of information and uncover hidden data connections. Consequently, the efficiency of earthquake emergency decision-making is compromised. To address this issue, this study proposes a method for constructing an earthquake event knowledge graph and utilizing it for decision-making in earthquake emergencies. Firstly, specialized earthquake event knowledge ontology is developed, tailored to the unique characteristics of earthquake event data. Secondly, structured instances of earthquake event knowledge are extracted from text using transfer learning techniques, enabling the construction of the earthquake event knowledge graph. Thirdly, the earthquake event knowledge is represented as multidimensional vectors using knowledge graph representation learning technology. This facilitates the identification of similar earthquake events through inference based on vector similarity computation. In conclusion, the results of a case-based study demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in providing accurate outcomes, facilitating earthquake event matching, enabling the retrieval and reuse of historical earthquake event knowledge, and serving as a valuable reference for earthquake emergency decision-making.",

      "abstract": "The massive amounts of online user behavior data on social networks allow for the investigation of information diffusion prediction, which is essential to comprehend how information propagates among users. The main difficulty in diffusion prediction problem is to effectively model the complex social factors in social networks and diffusion cascades. However, existing methods are mainly based on Euclidean space, which cannot well preserve the underlying hierarchical structures that could better reflect the strength of user influence. Meanwhile, existing methods cannot accurately model the obvious asymmetric features of the diffusion process. To alleviate these limitations, we utilize rotation transformation in the hyperbolic to model complex diffusion patterns. The modulus of representations in the hyperbolic space could effectively describe the strength of the user's influence. Rotation transformations could represent a variety of complex asymmetric features. Further, rotation transformation could model various social factors without changing the strength of influence. In this paper, we propose a novel hyperbolic rotation representation model RotDiff for the diffusion prediction problem. Specifically, we first map each social user to a Lorentzian vector and use two groups of transformations to encode global social factors in the social graph and the diffusion graph. Then, we combine attention mechanism in the hyperbolic space with extra rotation transformations to capture local diffusion dependencies within a given cascade. Experimental results on five real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model RotDiff outperforms various state-of-the-art diffusion prediction models.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are often incomplete, which can significantly impact the performance of downstream applications. Manual completion of KGs is time-consuming and costly, emphasizing the importance of developing automated methods for KGC. Link prediction serves as a fundamental task in this domain. The semantic correlation among entity features plays a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of link-prediction models. Notably, the human brain can often infer information using a limited set of salient features. Methods: Inspired by this cognitive principle, this paper proposes a lightweight Bi-level routing attention mechanism specifically designed for link-prediction tasks. This proposed module explores a theoretically grounded and lightweight structural design aimed at enhancing the semantic recognition capability of language models without altering their core parameters. The proposed module enhances the model’s ability to attend to feature regions with high semantic relevance. With only a marginal increase of approximately one million parameters, the mechanism effectively captures the most semantically informative features. Result: It replaces the original feature-extraction module within the KGML framework and is evaluated on the publicly available WN18RR and FB15K-237 dataset. Conclusions: Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in standard evaluation metrics, including Mean Rank (MR), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and Hits@10, thereby confirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

However, these embedding-based methods do not explicitly capture the compositional logical rules underlying the knowledge graph, and they are limited to the transductive setting, where the full set of entities must be known during training. Here, we propose a graph neural network based relation prediction framework, GraIL, that reasons over local subgraph structures and has a strong inductive bias to learn entity-independent relational semantics. Unlike embedding-based models, GraIL is naturally inductive and can generalize to unseen entities and graphs after training. We provide theoretical proof and strong empirical evidence that GraIL can represent a useful subset of first-order logic and show that GraIL outperforms existing rule-induction baselines in the inductive setting. We also demonstrate significant gains obtained by ensembling GraIL with various knowledge graph embedding methods in the transductive setting, highlighting the complementary inductive bias of our method.",

To address these issues, we introduce OrthogonalE, a novel KGE model employing matrices for entities and block-diagonal orthogonal matrices with Riemannian optimization for relations. This approach enhances the generality and flexibility of KGE models. The experimental results indicate that our new KGE model, OrthogonalE, is both general and flexible, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art KGE models while substantially reducing the number of relation parameters.",

      "abstract": "Cloud manufacturing has emerged as a service-oriented paradigm, in which knowledge graphs (KGs) play a crucial role in enabling modularization and on-demand servitization by converting unstructured resources into a structured graph representation and factual knowledge for manufacturing tasks. KG embedding converts entities and relations into a low-dimensional space while expressing rich semantics of high-dimensional KGs. Existing works just focus on translating relations surrounding the nodes of graphs, while ignoring the applicability for modeling and inferring multiple relation patterns in the manufacturing context. Furthermore, the relative importance of complex manufacturing relations among different dimensions in embedded procedures has been ignored, leading to unclear representation learning of complex relations and entities in KGs. To overcome this issue, in this article, a novel relation and entropy weight-aware embedding model is proposed, named TransCE. TransCE performs coordinated transformations in vector space by normalizing the distance to integrate coordination. An entropy-based weighting method is also proposed to represent complex relations and entities surrounding the edges of graph embedding and assign the weighted value of relations to support the score function. Extended experiments are performed on several datasets, and a manufacturing indicates that TransCE shows remarkable improvement relative to baseline models.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) constitutes a pivotal task for predicting missing relationships in knowledge graphs through existing triple analysis. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in KGC by exploiting graph structural patterns, their effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by inherent limitations such as over-smoothing – a phenomenon that causes entity representations to converge to indistinguishable states. This critical shortcoming impedes the model’s capacity to discern fine-grained semantic relationships within knowledge graphs. To overcome these challenges, we present SCCL-GNN, a novel negative sampling-enhanced graph contrastive learning framework that synergistically integrates contrastive learning (CL) with GNN architectures. Our methodology explicitly optimizes the representation space through two innovative negative sampling paradigms: (1) Cluster-aware negative sampling strategically selects intra-cluster negative samples to enhance discrimination of semantically proximate entities. (2) Scoring-driven hard negative mining employs entity scoring mechanisms to identify challenging negative pairs that maximize training signal efficacy. Through comprehensive experimentation on three benchmark datasets (FB15k-237, WN18RR, and Kinship), our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models. This work not only advances the frontier of KGC methodologies but also provides fundamental insights into multimodal learning paradigm design for graph representation learning.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs in the field of network security can integrate diverse, heterogeneous, and fragmented network security data, further explore the relationships between data, and provide support for deep analysis. Currently, there is sparse security information in the field of network security knowledge graphs. The limited information provided by traditional text encoding models leads to insufficient reasoning ability, greatly restricting the development of this field. Starting from text encoding, this paper first addresses the issue of the inadequate capabilities of traditional models using a deep learning model for assistance. It designs a vBiLSTM model based on a word2vec and BiLSTM combination to process network security texts. By utilizing word vector models to retain semantic information in entities and extract key features to input processed data into BiLSTM networks for extracting higher-level features that better capture and express their deeper meanings, this design significantly enhances understanding and expression capabilities toward complex semantics in long sentences before inputting final feature vectors into the KGC-N model. The KGC-N model uses feature vectors combined with graph structure information to fuse forward and reverse domain features and then utilizes a Transformer decoder to decode predictions and complete missing information within the network security knowledge map. Compared with other models using evaluation metrics such as MR, MRR demonstrates that employing our proposed method effectively improves performance on completion tasks and increases comprehension abilities toward complex relations, thereby enhancing accuracy and efficiency when completing knowledge graphs.",

      "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable utility across diverse applications, and their growing complexity has made Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) a viable platform for scalable deployment. However, this accessibility also exposes GNN to serious security threats, most notably model extraction attacks (MEAs), in which adversaries strategically query a deployed model to construct a high-fidelity replica. In this work, we evaluate the vulnerability of GNNs to MEAs and explore their potential for cost-effective model acquisition in non-adversarial research settings. Importantly, adaptive node querying strategies can also serve a critical role in research, particularly when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming. By selectively sampling informative nodes, researchers can train high-performing GNNs with minimal supervision, which is particularly valuable in domains such as biomedicine, where annotations often require expert input. To address this, we propose a node querying strategy tailored to a highly practical yet underexplored scenario, where bulk queries are prohibited, and only a limited set of initial nodes is available. Our approach iteratively refines the node selection mechanism over multiple learning cycles, leveraging historical feedback to improve extraction efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmark graph datasets demonstrate our superiority over comparable baselines on accuracy, fidelity, and F1 score under strict query-size constraints. These results highlight both the susceptibility of deployed GNNs to extraction attacks and the promise of ethical, efficient GNN acquisition methods to support low-resource research environments.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is typically used for link prediction to automatically predict missing links in knowledge graphs. Current KGE models are mainly based on complicated mathematical associations, which are highly expressive but ignore the uniformity behind the classical bilinear translational model TransE, a model that embeds all entities of knowledge graphs in a uniform space, enabling accurate embeddings. This study analyses the uniformity of TransE and proposes a novel KGE model called ConvUs that follows uniformity with expressiveness. Based on the convolution neural network (CNN), ConvUs proposes constraints on convolution filter values and employs a multi-layer, multi-scale CNN architecture with a non-parametric L2 norm-based scoring function for the calculation of triple scores. This addresses potential uniformity-related issues in existing CNN-based KGE models, allowing ConvUs to maintain a uniform embedding space while benefiting from the powerful expressiveness of CNNs. Furthermore, circular convolution is applied to alleviate the potential orderliness contradictions, making ConvUs more suitable for conducting uniform space KGE. Our model outperformed the base model ConvKB and several baselines on the link prediction benchmark WN18RR and FB15k-237, demonstrating strong applicability and generalization and indicating that the uniformity of embedding space with high expressiveness enables more efficient knowledge graph embeddings.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in graph-based learning approaches have demonstrated their effectiveness in modelling users’ preferences and items’ characteristics for Recommender Systems (RSs). Most of the data in RSs can be organized into graphs where various objects (e.g. users, items, and attributes) are explicitly or implicitly connected and influence each other via various relations. Such a graph-based organization brings benefits to exploiting potential properties in graph learning (e.g. random walk and network embedding) techniques to enrich the representations of the user and item nodes, which is an essential factor for successful recommendations. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of Graph Learning-based Recommender Systems (GLRSs). Specifically, we start from a data-driven perspective to systematically categorize various graphs in GLRSs and analyse their characteristics. Then, we discuss the state-of-the-art frameworks with a focus on the graph learning module and how they address practical recommendation challenges such as scalability, fairness, diversity, explainability, and so on. Finally, we share some potential research directions in this rapidly growing area.",

      "abstract": "The AI community is increasingly focused on merging logic with deep learning to create Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) paradigms and assist neural approaches with symbolic knowledge. A significant trend in the literature involves integrating axioms and facts in loss functions by grounding logical symbols with neural networks and operators with fuzzy semantics. Logic Tensor Networks (LTN) is one of the main representatives in this category, known for its simplicity, efficiency, and versatility. However, it has been previously shown that not all fuzzy operators perform equally when applied in a differentiable setting. Researchers have proposed several configurations of operators, trading off between effectiveness, numerical stability, and generalization to different formulas. This paper presents a configuration of fuzzy operators for grounding formulas end-to-end in the logarithm space. Our goal is to develop a configuration that is more effective than previous proposals, able to handle any formula, and numerically stable. To achieve this, we propose semantics that are best suited for the logarithm space and introduce novel simplifications and improvements that are crucial for optimization via gradient-descent. We use LTN as the framework for our experiments, but the conclusions of our work apply to any similar NeSy framework. Our findings, both formal and empirical, show that the proposed configuration outperforms the state-of-the-art and that each of our modifications is essential in achieving these results.",

      "abstract": "Real-world knowledge can take various forms, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. Among these, knowledge graphs are a form of structured human knowledge that integrate heterogeneous data sources into structured representations but typically reduce complex n-ary relations to simple triples, thereby losing higher-order relational details. In contrast, hypergraphs naturally represent n-ary relations with hyperedges, which directly connect multiple entities together. Yet hypergraph representation learning often overlooks entity roles in hyperedges, limiting the finegrained semantic modelling. To address these issues, knowledge hypergraphs and hyper-relational knowledge graphs combine the advantages of knowledge graphs and hypergraphs to better capture the complex structures and role-specific semantics of real world knowledge. This survey provides a comprehensive review of methods handling n-ary relational data, covering both knowledge hypergraphs and hyper-relational knowledge graphs literatures. We propose a two-dimensional taxonomy: the first dimension categorises models based on their methodology, i.e., translation-based models, tensor factorisation-based models, deep neural network-based models, logic rules-based models, and hyperedge expansion-based models. The second dimension classifies models according to their awareness of entity roles and positions in n-ary relations, dividing them into aware-less, position-aware, and role-aware approaches. Finally, we discuss existing datasets, training settings and strategies, and outline open challenges to inspire future research.",

Extracting valuable insights from traffic data, such as taxi trajectories, can significantly improve residents’ daily lives. There are many studies on spatiotemporal data mining. As we know, arrival prediction or regional function detection encompasses important tasks for traffic management and urban planning. However, trajectory data are often mutilated because of personal privacy and hardware limitations, i.e., we usually can only obtain partial trajectory information. In this paper, we develop an embedding method to predict the next arrival using the origin–destination (O-D) pair trajectory information and point of interest (POI) data. Moreover, the embedding information contains region latent features; thus, we also detect the regional function in this paper. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive experimental study on a real-world trajectory dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the benefit of predicting arrivals, and the embedding vectors can detect the regional function in a city.",

      "abstract": "As knowledge graphs are constantly emerging, effectively merging complex and heterogeneous knowledge graphs has become a critical challenge for improving knowledge quality and completeness. Entity alignment, as a crucial task in knowledge graph fusion, aims to identify equivalent entities across different knowledge graphs. However, existing entity alignment methods fail to fully exploit the interactions between knowledge graphs and introduce noise in graph augmentation. To address these problems, this paper proposes an entity alignment method based on structure-aware and heterogeneous adaptive fusion (SHAF). First, a hybrid graph enhancement approach based on edge reconstruction and graph propagation is introduced, where edge reconstruction optimizes the adjacency matrix, and graph propagation enhances the model’s perception of latent structural features. Second, heterogeneous adaptive fusion method is designed to dynamically help the integration of entity and relation features. Specifically, gating mechanism and residual layer are employed to control the flow of information, thereby enhancing the discriminative ability of entity representations. Finally, local graph-aware contrastive optimization is developed, incorporating contrastive learning and local neighbor alignment loss to make the representations of aligned entity closer. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior alignment performance on the benchmark dataset.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) has garnered massive research interest recently, and most existing methods are designed following a transductive setting where all entities are observed during training. Despite the great progress on the transductive KGC, these methods struggle to conduct reasoning on emerging KGs involving unseen entities. Thus, inductive KGC, which aims to deduce missing links among unseen entities, has become a new trend. Many existing studies transform inductive KGC as a graph classification problem by extracting enclosing subgraphs surrounding each candidate triple. Unfortunately, they still face certain challenges, such as the expensive time consumption caused by the repeat extraction of enclosing subgraphs, and the deficiency of entity-independent feature learning. To address these issues, we propose a global-local anchor representation (GLAR) learning method for inductive KGC. Unlike previous methods that utilize enclosing subgraphs, we extract a shared opening subgraph for all candidates and perform reasoning on it, enabling the model to perform reasoning more efficiently. Moreover, we design some transferable global and local anchors to learn rich entity-independent features for emerging entities. Finally, a global-local graph reasoning model is applied on the opening subgraph to rank all candidates. Extensive experiments show that our GLAR outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) is a popular topic in knowledge graph construction and related applications, aiming to complete the structure of knowledge graphs by predicting missing entities or relations and mining unknown facts in the knowledge graph. In the KGC task, Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based methods have achieved remarkable results due to their advantage of effectively capturing complex relations among entities and generating more accurate and rich entity representations by aggregating information from neighbouring nodes. These methods mainly focus on the representation of entities, and the representation of relations is obtained using simple dimensional transformations or initial embeddings. This treatment ignores the diversity and complex semantics of relations and restricts the efficiency of the model in utilizing relational information in the reasoning process. In this work, we propose the Relational Representation Augmented Graph Attention Network (RRA-GAT), which effectively identifies and weights neighbouring relations that actually contribute to the target relation by filtering out irrelevant information through an attention function based on the information and spatial domain. Furthermore, we capture complex patterns and features in the relational embedding by means of a feed-forward network consisting of a series of linear transformations and nonlinear activation functions. Experiments demonstrate the very advanced performance of RRA-GAT on the link prediction task on standard datasets FB15k-237 and WN18RR (e.g., improved the MRR metric on the WN18RR dataset by 7.8% relative improvement).",

      "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graph, serving as an effective way to store and model dynamic relations, shows promising prospects in event forecasting. However, most temporal knowledge graph reasoning methods are highly dependent on the recurrence or periodicity of events, which brings challenges to inferring future events related to entities that lack historical interaction. In fact, the current moment is often the combined effect of a small part of historical information and those unobserved underlying factors. To this end, we propose a new event forecasting model called Contrastive Event Network (CENET), based on a novel training framework of historical contrastive learning. CENET learns both the historical and non-historical dependency to distinguish the most potential entities that can best match the given query. Simultaneously, it trains representations of queries to investigate whether the current moment depends more on historical or non-historical events by launching contrastive learning. The representations further help train a binary classifier whose output is a boolean mask to indicate related entities in the search space. During the inference process, CENET employs a mask-based strategy to generate the final results. We evaluate our proposed model on five benchmark graphs. The results demonstrate that CENET significantly outperforms all existing methods in most metrics, achieving at least 8.3% relative improvement of Hits@1 over previous state-of-the-art baselines on event-based datasets.",

In this study, we present a comprehensive ZS learning approach that explores and evaluates the machine’s abilities of discovering and utilizing knowledge. More specifically, to emulate human-like knowledge discovery and utilization processes, we propose a novel visual-aware ZS knowledge graph completion task for evaluation, incorporating a traditional ZS image classification task. Technically, we develop a unified ZS learning paradigm named Cognitive Learner (CoLa) to foster the two knowledge-aware abilities. Including a knowledge representation learning (KRL) module and a knowledge adaptation (KA) module, CoLa adapts well to the two specified tasks with the corresponding data. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate CoLa models’ outstanding performance over compared methods in the two ZS tasks, illustrating their superior ability of discovering and utilizing knowledge.",

We propose a knowledge graph completion model, CSANN, which integrates GCN and self-attention mechanisms. First, GCN module is used to learn the initial representations of entities and relationships, considering the neighboring information of entities. Next, the initial representations of entities and relationships are concatenated to form a sequence, which is further refined by introducing the self-attention mechanism. By combining the local graph structure awareness of GCN and the sequential dependency capturing ability of self-attention mechanisms, CSANN improves the accuracy of knowledge graph completion. Experiments conducted on two public datasets, FB15K-237 and WN18RR, show that the proposed model outperforms many classical models, such as TransE, DistMult, ConvE, and RotatE, in terms of Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@K.",

Therefore, this paper addresses knowledge inference on n-ary facts. We represent each n-ary fact as a primary triple coupled with a set of its auxiliary descriptive attribute-value pair(s). We further propose a neural network model, NeuInfer, for knowledge inference on n-ary facts.

      "abstract": "Link prediction in knowledge hypergraphs is essential for various knowledge-based applications, including question answering and recommendation systems. However, many current approaches simply extend binary relation methods from knowledge graphs to n -ary relations, which does not allow for capturing entity positional and role information in n -ary tuples. To address this issue, we introduce PosKHG, a method that considers entities’ positions and roles within n -ary tuples. PosKHG uses an embedding space with basis vectors to represent entities’ positional and role information through a linear combination, which allows for similar representations of entities with related roles and positions. Additionally, PosKHG employs a relation matrix to capture the compatibility of both information with all associated entities and a scoring function to measure the plausibility of tuples made up of entities with specific roles and positions. PosKHG achieves full expressiveness and high prediction efficiency. In experimental results, PosKHG achieved an average improvement of 4.1% on MRR compared to other state-of-the-art knowledge hypergraph embedding methods.

      "abstract": "Abstract Natural-language spatial relations between geographic entities (geoentities) reflect diverse perceptions influenced by factors like location, culture, and linguistic conventions. These relations play a crucial role in supporting geospatial tasks, such as question answering and cognitive reasoning. While prior studies focused on a limited set of human-selected spatial terms and geometric attributes, they often overlooked essential semantic attributes. To overcome this limitation, we developed a Spatial Relation-based Knowledge Graph Embedding framework, SR-KGE, with new KG fusion functions to predict spatial relation terms among distinct geoentities. This method not only considers graph structures and the diversity of natural language expressions in the embedding and learning process, but also incorporates geoentity types as a constraint to capture spatial and semantic relations more accurately. Our experiments on two knowledge graph datasets, one small-scale and one large-scale, have both shown its superior performance in spatial relation inference compared to popular KGE models, including TransE, RotatE, and HAKE. We hope our research will advance the classic study of natural language described spatial relations in a more automated and intelligent way.",

While most inductive knowledge graph completion methods assume that all entities can be new, they do not allow new relations to appear at inference time. This restriction prohibits the existing methods from appropriately handling real-world knowledge graphs where new entities accompany new relations. In this paper, we propose an INductive knowledge GRAph eMbedding method, InGram, that can generate embeddings of new relations as well as new entities at inference time. Given a knowledge graph, we define a relation graph as a weighted graph consisting of relations and the affinity weights between them. Based on the relation graph and the original knowledge graph, InGram learns how to aggregate neighboring embeddings to generate relation and entity embeddings using an attention mechanism. Experimental results show that InGram outperforms 14 different state-of-the-art methods on varied inductive learning scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) have recently drawn attention due to their capacity of delivering personalized recommendations through multi-turn natural language interactions. In this paper, we fit into this research line and we introduce a Knowledge-Aware Sequential Conversational Recommender System (KASCRS) that exploits transformers and knowledge graph embeddings to provide users with recommendations in a conversational setting. In particular, KASCRS is able to predict a suitable recommendation based on the elements that are mentioned in a conversation between a user and a CRS. To do this, we design a model that: (i) encodes each conversation as a sequence of entities that are mentioned in the dialogue (i.e., items and properties), and (ii) is trained on a cloze task, that is to say, it learns to predict the final element in the sequence - that corresponds to the item to be recommended - based on the information it has previously seen. The model has two main hallmarks: first, we exploit Transformers and self-attention to capture the sequential dependencies that exist among the entities that are mentioned in the training dialogues, in a way similar to session-based recommender systems [25]. Next, we used knowledge graphs (KG) to improve the quality of the representation of the elements mentioned in each sequence. Indeed, we exploit knowledge graph embeddings techniques to pre-train the representation of items and properties, and we fed the input layer of our architecture with the resulting embeddings. In this way, KASCRS integrates both knowledge from the KGs as well as the dependencies and the co-occurrences emerging from conversational data, resulting in a more accurate representation of users and items. Our experiments confirmed this intuition, since KASCRS overcame several state-of-the-art baselines on two different datasets.",

Existing well-known models deal with this task by mainly focusing on representing knowledge graph triplets in the distance space or semantic space.

Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel knowledge graph embedding model for the link prediction task, namely, HIE, which models each triplet (\\textit{h}, \\textit{r}, \\textit{t}) into distance measurement space and semantic measurement space, simultaneously. Moreover, HIE is introduced into hierarchical-aware space to leverage rich hierarchical information of entities and relations for better representation learning. Specifically, we apply distance transformation operation on the head entity in distance space to obtain the tail entity instead of translation-based or rotation-based approaches. Experimental results of HIE on four real-world datasets show that HIE outperforms several existing state-of-the-art knowledge graph embedding methods on the link prediction task and deals with complex relations accurately.",

      "abstract": "Complex multi-hop logical queries are a highly regarded problem in the field of knowledge graphs. The challenge lies in whether the query model can effectively rely on observed entities and edges to handle incomplete knowledge graphs in the real world. This requires the model to be able to correctly retrieve answers even when encountering unobserved intermediate entities or relations while processing complex logical queries involving missing information. In this paper, we propose a neural-symbolic integration approach to address the first-order logical query problem on knowledge graphs and make improvements and optimizations to this approach. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: (1) We design and implement a neural-symbolic integration model for knowledge graph logical queries, which consists of symbol query decomposition, neural relation projection, and fuzzy logical inference components. (2) We propose a relation-aware model for complex logical queries on knowledge graphs, which includes a newly designed graph neural network with residual structures and a relation-enhancement module to improve the accuracy and generalization capability of the model. Experimental results on the FB15k-237 dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed model for knowledge graph logical query tasks.

TKG reasoning aims to predict future facts based on given historical ones. However, existing TKG reasoning models are unable to abstain from predictions they are uncertain, which will inevitably bring risks in real-world applications. Thus, in this paper, we propose an abstention mechanism for TKG reasoning, which helps the existing models make selective, instead of indiscriminate, predictions. Specifically, we develop a confidence estimator, called Confidence Estimator with History (CEHis), to enable the existing TKG reasoning models to first estimate their confidence in making predictions, and then abstain from those with low confidence. To do so, CEHis takes two kinds of information into consideration, namely, the certainty of the current prediction and the accuracy of historical predictions. Experiments with representative TKG reasoning models on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CEHis.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) has been widely studied as an important semantic enhancement technique that extracts expressive representation from Knowledge Graph (KG) to facilitate various downstream applications, such as knowledge reasoning, Semantic Web, and question answering. The advent of Federated KGE (FKGE) allows for collaborative training across distributed KGs without revealing clients’ private raw KGs that contain sensitive knowledge graph triples. Despite this, FKGE remains susceptible to privacy threats as demonstrated in previously studied federated learning models. However, utilizing and addressing these vulnerabilities remain uninvestigated for FKGE which exhibits unique characteristics distinct from other models. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive study of the privacy issues in FKGE from both attack and defense perspectives. On the attack side, we introduce five new inference attacks, highlighting the privacy vulnerabilities by successfully deducing the presence of KG triples from the targeted dataset. On the defense side, we present PDP-Flames, a novel differentially private FKGE scheme that leverages the sparse gradient nature of FKGE for better privacy-utility trade-off by integrating advanced private selection techniques. We further introduce a dynamic defense policy based on the observation that the privacy risk fluctuates throughout the training procedure. Additionally, we incorporate a personalized procedure to provide a customized model tailored to the unique data distributions of individual clients. Joint differential privacy is introduced to guarantee the privacy of the personalized models. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PDP-Flames effectively mitigates privacy concerns, notably diminishing the attack success rate while maintaining decent model utility.",

Most previous models focus on learning representations for entities and relations via graph neural networks. In this formalism, representations heavily rely on structural information. However, it is common for Knowledge graphs (KGs) to be unconnected due to their inherent incompleteness, resulting in a significant loss of vital structural information. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes to increase the connectedness of KGs to facilitate message passing between entities. Specifically, we first augment KGs with a series of auxiliary triplets derived from outer nodes. Subsequently, a dynamically weighted graph convolutional layer is employed to unequally aggregate the representations of neighboring entities and dynamically combine this aggregated information with information from themselves. Finally, ConvE is utilized to calculate scores for all triplets. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to strong baseline models.",

Text-based methods, which depend on textual descriptions of triples, often encounter difficulties when these descriptions lack sufficient information for accurate prediction-an issue inherent to the datasets and not easily resolved through modeling alone. To address this and ensure data consistency, we first use large language models (LLMs) to generate coherent descriptions, bridging the semantic gap between queries and answers. Secondly, we utilize inverse relations to create a symmetric graph, thereby providing augmented training samples for KGC. Additionally, we employ the label information inherent in knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance the existing contrastive framework, making it fully supervised. These efforts have led to significant performance improvements on the WN18RR and FB15k-237 datasets.

Secondly, as the ICH project is being further explored with the limited coverage of ICH knowledge, entity sparsity poses a serious challenge for ICH KGE. This paper employs the BERT model to encode the complete description information of entities, and establishes connection between triples entities and ontology concepts via cross-view modeling. Finally, the proposed ICHMKGE model is compared with the baseline models, and the experimental results demonstrate that the model exhibits superiority.",

      "abstract": "Cross-lingual entity alignment in knowledge graphs is a crucial task in knowledge fusion. This task involves learning low-dimensional embeddings for nodes in different knowledge graphs and identifying equivalent entities across them by measuring the distances between their representation vectors. Existing alignment models use neural network modules and the nearest neighbors algorithm to find suitable entity pairs. However, these models often ignore the importance of local structural features of entities during the alignment stage, which may lead to reduced matching accuracy. Specifically, nodes that are poorly represented may not benefit from their surrounding context. In this article, we propose a novel alignment model called SSR, which leverages the node embedding algorithm in graphs to select candidate entities and then rearranges them by local structural similarity in the source and target knowledge graphs. Our approach improves the performance of existing approaches and is compatible with them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the DBP15k dataset, showing that it outperforms existing methods while requiring less time.",

      "abstract": "Complex Query Answering (CQA) over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) has attracted a lot of attention to potentially support many applications. Given that KGs are usually incomplete, neural models are proposed to answer the logical queries by parameterizing set operators with complex neural networks. However, such methods usually train neural set operators with a large number of entity and relation embeddings from the zero, where whether and how the embeddings or the neural set operators contribute to the performance remains not clear. In this paper, we propose a simple framework for complex query answering that decomposes the KG embeddings from neural set operators. We propose to represent the complex queries into the query graph. On top of the query graph, we propose the Logical Message Passing Neural Network (LMPNN) that connects the local one-hop inferences on atomic formulas to the global logical reasoning for complex query answering. We leverage existing effective KG embeddings to conduct one-hop inferences on atomic formulas, the results of which are regarded as the messages passed in LMPNN. The reasoning process over the overall logical formulas is turned into the forward pass of LMPNN that incrementally aggregates local information to finally predict the answers' embeddings. The complex logical inference across different types of queries will then be learned from training examples based on the LMPNN architecture. Theoretically, our query-graph represenation is more general than the prevailing operator-tree formulation, so our approach applies to a broader range of complex KG queries. Empirically, our approach yields the new state-of-the-art neural CQA model. Our research bridges the gap between complex KG query answering tasks and the long-standing achievements of knowledge graph representation learning.",

Traditional symbolic methods traverse a complete knowledge graph to extract the answers, which provides good interpretation for each step. Recent neural methods learn geometric embeddings for complex queries. These methods can generalize to incomplete knowledge graphs, but their reasoning process is hard to interpret. In this paper, we propose Graph Neural Network Query Executor (GNN-QE), a neural-symbolic model that enjoys the advantages of both worlds. GNN-QE decomposes a complex FOL query into relation projections and logical operations over fuzzy sets, which provides interpretability for intermediate variables. To reason about the missing links, GNN-QE adapts a graph neural network from knowledge graph completion to execute the relation projections, and models the logical operations with product fuzzy logic. Experiments on 3 datasets show that GNN-QE significantly improves over previous state-of-the-art models in answering FOL queries. Meanwhile, GNN-QE can predict the number of answers without explicit supervision, and provide visualizations for intermediate variables.",

      "abstract": "The traditional model training approach based on negative sampling randomly samples a portion of negative samples for training, which can easily overlook important negative samples and adversely affect the training of knowledge graph embedding models. Some researchers have explored non-sampling model training frameworks that use all unobserved triples as negative samples to improve model training performance. However, both training methods inevitably introduce false negative samples and easy-to-separate negative samples that are far from the model’s decision boundary, and they do not consider the adverse effects of long-tail entities and relations during training, thus limiting the improvement of model training performance. To address this issue, we propose a universal knowledge graph embedding framework based on high-quality negative sampling and weighting, called HNSW-KGE. First, we conduct pre-training based on the NS-KGE non-sampling training framework to quickly obtain an initial set of relatively high-quality embedding vector representations for all entities and relations. Second, we design a candidate negative sample set construction strategy that samples a certain number of negative samples that are neither false negatives nor easy-to-separate negatives for all positive triples, based on the embedding vectors obtained from pre-training. This ensures the provision of high-quality negative samples for model training. Finally, we apply weighting to the loss function based on the frequency of the entities and relations appearing in the triples to mitigate the adverse effects of long-tail entities and relations on model training. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets FB15K237 and WN18RR using various knowledge graph embedding models demonstrate that our proposed framework HNSW-KGE, based on high-quality negative sampling and weighting, achieves better training performance and exhibits versatility, making it applicable to various types of knowledge embedding models.",

      "abstract": "This paper investigates the few-shot temporal reasoning capability within the hyperbolic space. The goal is to forecast future events for newly emerging entities within temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs), leveraging only a limited set of initial observations. Hyperbolic space is advantageous for modeling emerging graph entities for two reasons: First, its geometric property of exponential expansion aligns with the rapid growth of new entities in real-world graphs; Second, it excels in capturing power-law patterns and hierarchical structures, well-suitable for new entities distributed at the peripheries of graph hierarchies and loosely connected with others through few links. We therefore propose a meta-learning framework, MetaHKG, to enable few-shot temporal reasoning within a hyperbolic space. Unlike prior hyperbolic learning works, MetaHKG addresses the challenges of effectively representing new entities in TKGs and adapting model parameters by incorporating novel hyperbolic time encodings and temporal attention networks that achieve translational invariance. We also introduce a meta hyperbolic optimization algorithm to enhance model adaptation by learning both global and entity-specific parameters through bi-level optimization. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three real-world temporal knowledge graphs demonstrate the superiority of MetaHKG over a diverse range of baselines, which achieves average 5.2% relative improvements. Compared to its Euclidean counterpart, MetaHKG operates in a lower-dimensional space but yields a more stable and efficient adaptability towards new entities.",

      "abstract": "The goal of sequential recommendation algorithms is to predict personalized sequential behaviors of users (i.e., next-item recommendation). Learning representations of entities (i.e., users and items) from sparse interaction behaviors and capturing the relationships between entities are the main challenges for sequential recommendation. However, most sequential recommendation algorithms model relationships among entities in Euclidean space, where it is difficult to capture hierarchical relationships among entities. Moreover, most of them utilize independent components to model the user preferences and the sequential behaviors, ignoring the correlation between them. To simultaneously capture the hierarchical structure relationships and model the user preferences and the sequential behaviors in a unified framework, we propose a general hyperbolic translation-based sequential recommendation framework, namely HTSR. Specifically, we first measure the distance between entities in hyperbolic space. Then, we utilize personalized hyperbolic translation operations to model the third-order relationships among a user, his/her latest visited item, and the next item to consume. In addition, we instantiate two hyperbolic translation-based sequential recommendation models, namely Poincaré translation-based sequential recommendation (PoTSR) and Lorentzian translation-based sequential recommendation (LoTSR). PoTSR and LoTSR utilize the Poincaré distance and Lorentzian distance to measure similarities between entities, respectively. Moreover, we utilize the tangent space optimization method to determine optimal model parameters. Experimental results on five real-world datasets show that our proposed hyperbolic translation-based sequential recommendation methods outperform the state-of-the-art sequential recommendation algorithms.",

To this end, we propose a novel distributional feature modeling approach for training TKGR models, Test-Time Training-guided Distribution shift Modelling (T3DM), to adjust the model based on distribution shift and ensure the global consistency of model reasoning.

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph completion (KGC) is the task of inferencing missing facts from any given knowledge graphs (KG). Previous KGC methods typically represent knowledge graph entities and relations as trainable continuous embeddings and fuse the embeddings of the entity $h$ (or $t$) and relation $r$ into hidden representations of query $(h, r, ?)$ (or $(?, r, t$)) to approximate the missing entities. To achieve this, they either use shallow linear transformations or deep convolutional modules. However, the linear transformations suffer from the expressiveness issue while the deep convolutional modules introduce unnecessary inductive bias, which could potentially degrade the model performance. Thus, we propose a novel Transformer-based Patch Refinement Model (PatReFormer) for KGC. PatReFormer first segments the embedding into a sequence of patches and then employs cross-attention modules to allow bi-directional embedding feature interaction between the entities and relations, leading to a better understanding of the underlying KG. We conduct experiments on four popular KGC benchmarks, WN18RR, FB15k-237, YAGO37 and DB100K. The experimental results show significant performance improvement from existing KGC methods on standard KGC evaluation metrics, e.g., MRR and H@n. Our analysis first verifies the effectiveness of our model design choices in PatReFormer. We then find that PatReFormer can better capture KG information from a large relation embedding dimension. Finally, we demonstrate that the strength of PatReFormer is at complex relation types, compared to other KGC models",

      "abstract": "Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding (CKGE) seeks to integrate new knowledge while preserving past information. However, existing methods struggle with efficiency and scalability due to two key limitations: (1) suboptimal knowledge preservation between snapshots caused by manually designed node/relation importance scores that ignore graph dependencies relevant to the downstream task, and (2) computationally expensive graph traversal for node/relation importance calculation, leading to slow training and high memory overhead. To address these limitations, we introduce ETT-CKGE (Efficient, Task-driven, Tokens for Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding), a novel task-guided CKGE method that leverages efficient task-driven tokens for efficient and effective knowledge transfer between snapshots. Our method introduces a set of learnable tokens that directly capture task-relevant signals, eliminating the need for explicit node scoring or traversal. These tokens serve as consistent and reusable guidance across snapshots, enabling efficient token-masked embedding alignment between snapshots. Importantly, knowledge transfer is achieved through simple matrix operations, significantly reducing training time and memory usage. Extensive experiments across six benchmark datasets demonstrate that ETT-CKGE consistently achieves superior or competitive predictive performance, while substantially improving training efficiency and scalability compared to state-of-the-art CKGE methods.

      "abstract": "Knowledge reasoning is a critical task in information fusion systems, and its core step is reasoning missing information from existing facts to improve the knowledge graphs. Embedding-based reasoning methods and path-based reasoning methods are two mainstream knowledge reasoning methods. Embedding-based reasoning methods enable fast and direct reasoning but are limited to simple relationships between entities and exhibit poor performance in reasoning complex logical relationships. Path-based reasoning methods perform better in complex reasoning tasks, but suffer from high computational complexity, a large number of model parameters, and low reasoning efficiency. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper introduces a knowledge reasoning model called Quantum-Inspired Reinforcement Learning (QIRL). QIRL leverages quantum reinforcement learning to train a strategy network via a quantum circuit, aiming to generate and optimize reasoning paths. Quantum circuit achieves complex nonlinear operations through limited quantum reasoning paths gate operations, reducing computational complexity. In addition, this article utilizes the quantum entanglement property to encode high-dimensional data, reducing the number of model training parameters. This article evaluates the QIRL method on entity prediction task and proves that the QIRL method can effectively reduce the number of model training parameters.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs have proven highly effective for learning representations of entities and relations, with hyper-relational knowledge graphs (HKGs) gaining increased attention due to their enhanced representation capabilities. Each fact in an HKG consists of a main triple supplemented by attribute-value qualifiers that provide additional contextual information. Due to the complexity of hyper-relations, HKGs typically contain complex geometric structures, such as hierarchical, ring, and chain structures, often mixed together. However, previous work mainly embeds HKGs into Euclidean space, limiting their ability to capture these complex geometric structures simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose a novel model called Geometry Aware Hyper-relational Embedding (GAHE). Specifically, GAHE adopts a multi-curvature geometry-aware approach by modeling HKGs in Euclidean space (zero curvature), hyperbolic space (negative curvature), and hyperspherical space (positive curvature) in a unified framework. In this way, it can integrate space-invariant and space-specific features to accurately capture the diverse structures in HKGs. In addition, GAHE introduces a module termed hyper-relational subspace learning, which allocates multiple sub-relations for each hyper-relation. It enables the exploitation of abundant latent semantic interactions and facilitates the exploration of fine-grained semantics between attribute-value pairs and hyper-relations across multiple subspaces. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees that GAHE is fully expressive and capable of modeling a wide range of semantic patterns for hyper-relations. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that GAHE achieves state-of-the-art results on both hyper-relational and binary-relational benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) learning offers a powerful framework for generating new knowledge and making inferences. Training KG embedding can take a significantly long time, especially for larger datasets. Our analysis shows that the gradient computation of embedding is one of the dominant functions in the translation-based KG embedding training loop. We address this issue by replacing the core embedding computation with SpMM (Sparse-Dense Matrix Multiplication) kernels. This allows us to unify multiple scatter (and gather) operations as a single operation, reducing training time and memory usage. We create a general framework for training KG models using sparse kernels and implement four models, namely TransE, TransR, TransH, and TorusE. Our sparse implementations exhibit up to 5.3x speedup on the CPU and up to 4.2x speedup on the GPU with a significantly low GPU memory footprint. The speedups are consistent across large and small datasets for a given model. Our proposed sparse approach can be extended to accelerate other translation-based (such as TransC, TransM, etc.) and non-translational (such as DistMult, ComplEx, RotatE, etc.) models as well. An implementation of the SpTransX framework is publicly available as a Python package in https://github.com/HipGraph/SpTransX.",

Most existing KGC methods focus on single features (e.g., relation types) or sub-graph aggregation.

To address these shortcomings, we propose a knowledge-aware reasoning model (MUSE), which designs a novel multi-knowledge representation learning mechanism for missing relation prediction.

The experimental results show that MUSE significantly outperforms other baselines on four public datasets, achieving over 5.50% H@1 improvement and 4.20% MRR improvement on the NELL995 dataset.

      "abstract": "In knowledge graph embedding, leveraging relation specific entity transformation has markedly enhanced performance. However, the consistency of embedding differences before and after transformation remains unaddressed, risking the loss of valuable inductive bias inherent in the embeddings. This inconsistency stems from two problems. First, transformation representations are specified for relations in a disconnected manner, allowing dissimilar transformations and corresponding entity embeddings for similar relations. Second, a generalized plug-in approach as a SFBR (Semantic Filter Based on Relations) disrupts this consistency through excessive concentration of entity embeddings under entity-based regularization, generating indistinguishable score distributions among relations. In this paper, we introduce a plug-in KGE method, Relation-Semantics Consistent Filter (RSCF). Its entity transformation has three features for enhancing semantic consistency: 1) shared affine transformation of relation embeddings across all relations, 2) rooted entity transformation that adds an entity embedding to its change represented by the transformed vector, and 3) normalization of the change to prevent scale reduction. To amplify the advantages of consistency that preserve semantics on embeddings, RSCF adds relation transformation and prediction modules for enhancing the semantics. In knowledge graph completion tasks with distance-based and tensor decomposition models, RSCF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art KGE methods, showing robustness across all relations and their frequencies.",

Existing methods are mainly divided into two types: translational distance models and semantic matching models. A key challenge in translational distance models is their inability to effectively differentiate between 'head' and 'tail' entities in graphs. To address this problem, a novel location-sensitive embedding (LSE) method has been developed. LSE innovatively modifies the head entity using relation-specific mappings, conceptualizing relations as linear transformations rather than mere translations. The theoretical foundations of LSE, including its representational capabilities and its connections to existing models, have been thoroughly examined. A more streamlined variant, LSEd, which employs a diagonal matrix for transformations to enhance practical efficiency, is also proposed. Experiments conducted on four large-scale KG datasets for link prediction show that LSEd either outperforms or is competitive with state-of-the-art related works.",

In this paper, we propose a model based on an attention mechanism and integrating the type information of entities, named KTAT. This model is based on the graph attention mechanism, to distribute corresponding attention mechanisms according to different weights between nodes. We introduce a type-specific hyperplane, which enables entities to have different embedding representations according to their type in the current triplet. Simultaneously, we also used textual description information of entities to improve the performance of the model. We conducted link prediction experiments on the FB15k and FB15k-237 datasets. The experimental results show that our model outperforms previous advanced methods compared to some baseline models, and demonstrate that combining type information can effectively improve the performance of link prediction.",

      "abstract": "Site selection determines optimal locations for new stores, which is of crucial importance for business success and urban development. Especially, the wide application of artificial intelligence with multi-source urban data makes intelligent site selection promising. Nevertheless, existing data-driven approaches heavily rely on feature engineering, which cannot take the complex relationships as well as the diverse influences of various semantics among data into consideration. Further, most approaches fail to reveal underlying factors for site decisions. To get rid of the dilemma, in this work, leveraging the knowledge graph (KG) technique, we propose a knowledge-driven model for site selection, short for KnowSite. Specifically, by empowering rich semantics in KG, we firstly construct an urban KG (UrbanKG) for site selection knowledge discovery with cities' key elements and complex relationships captured. Based on UrbanKG, we apply pre-training for semantic representations, and then design a generalized encoder-decoder structure for site decisions. KnowSite designs a graph neural network based encoder to adaptively model diverse influences, and further builds a relation path based decoder revealing the reasons behind site decisions. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate that KnowSite outperforms representative baselines by more than 9% on precision. Moreover, KnowSite provides intuitive and convincing explanations for site decisions and sheds light on the site selection understanding.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have not only revolutionized natural language processing but also extended their prowess to various domains, marking a significant stride toward artificial general intelligence. The interplay between LLMs and evolutionary algorithms (EAs), despite differing in objectives and methodologies, share a common pursuit of applicability in complex problems. Meanwhile, EA can provide an optimization framework for LLM’s further enhancement under closed box settings, empowering LLM with flexible global search capacities. On the other hand, the abundant domain knowledge inherent in LLMs could enable EA to conduct more intelligent searches. Furthermore, the text processing and generative capabilities of LLMs would aid in deploying EAs across a wide range of tasks. Based on these complementary advantages, this article provides a thorough review and a forward-looking roadmap, categorizing the reciprocal inspiration into two main avenues: 1) LLM-enhanced EA and 2) EA-enhanced LLM. Some integrated synergy methods are further introduced to exemplify the complementarity between LLMs and EAs in diverse scenarios, including code generation, software engineering, neural architecture search, and various generation tasks. As the first comprehensive review focused on the EA research in the era of LLMs, this article provides a foundational stepping stone for understanding the collaborative potential of LLMs and EAs. The identified challenges and future directions offer guidance for researchers and practitioners to unlock the full potential of this innovative collaboration in propelling advancements in optimization and artificial intelligence.

As a form of structured human knowledge, knowledge graphs have received widespread attention from the academic and industrial communities since their inception, and have been widely applied in fields such as information retrieval, intelligent question answering, and recommendation systems. Traditionally, these graphs focused solely on textual data, overlooking inter-modality influences. However, with the internet's information explosion, the demand for multi-modal knowledge graphs has surged. Knowledge representation learning is an important application for knowledge graphs completing, and traditional knowledge graph representation learning has often only considered single modality information, which has certain limitations. To address this, our study leverages the FreeBase15K dataset to create a sample multi-modal knowledge graph incorporating text, images, and speech. We also develop an information retrieval system tailored to this knowledge graph and conduct knowledge representation learning across these multi-modal data. Our experiments demonstrate the positive impact of integrating multi-modal data into knowledge representation models. Moreover, compared to the original model, our proposed method, with the same parameters, achieved a 24% improvement on the Hit@10 (raw) metric. To our knowledge, this is the first study to construct a multi-modal knowledge graph and apply it to knowledge representation learning tasks using text, images, and speech as a combined approach.",

      "abstract": "The task of Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) is vital for leveraging the full potential of Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which encode rich semantic information about entities and their relationships. Recently, LLM-based KGC methods have achieved significant advancements, which usually leverage pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to encode entity’s (or relation’s) descriptions. While promising, current LLM-based KGC methods face limitations due to the quality of available text data and the incomplete nature of KGs, especially the commonly missing relation’s descriptions. To address this kind of challenges, this paper proposes a general framework, which harnesses the power of LLMs, as well as high-quality pre-defined concept semantics from extra Knowledge Bases (KB), to enhance the input data for current LLM-based KGC models. Especially, our framework consists of two main components for better understanding relation’s semantics, from diverse levels (i.e., KG-level and triple-level), offering a more nuanced perspective on relation understanding. Actually, the proposed work could be used as an easy-to-accomplish plug-in unit, for improving many kinds of current native LLM-based KGC models. By leveraging LLMs and KBs from various levels, our framework could improve the understanding of relation meanings. These enhancements collectively contribute to the improved performance of LLM-based KGC models, particularly in scenarios where the KG is sparse or incomplete. We conduct extensive experiments on several LLM-based KGC models and real-world datasets to validate the efficacy of our approach. The empirical results indicate that our framework markedly enhances the efficacy of LLM-based KGC models across both entity prediction and triple classification tasks.",

Besides, a new universal framework based on the CNN-ECFA strategy is introduced for knowledge graph embedding learning. Experiments are conducted on publicly-available standard datasets for a link prediction task including WN18RR, YAGO3-10 and NELL-995. Results show that the CNN-ECFA strategy outperforms the state-of-the-art feature projection strategies with average improvements of 0.6% and 0.7% of MRR and Hits@1 on all the datasets, demonstrating our CNN-ECFA strategy is more effective for knowledge graph embedding learning.

      "abstract": "Semi-supervised node classification is a crucial challenge in relational data mining and has attracted increasing interest in research on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, previous approaches merely utilize labeled nodes to supervise the overall optimization, but fail to sufficiently explore the information of their underlying label distribution. Even worse, they often overlook the robustness of models, which may cause instability of network outputs to random perturbations. To address the aforementioned shortcomings, we develop a novel framework termed Hybrid Curriculum Pseudo-Labeling (HCPL) for efficient semi-supervised node classification. Technically, HCPL iteratively annotates unlabeled nodes by training a GNN model on the labeled samples and any previously pseudo-labeled samples, and repeatedly conducts this process. To improve the model robustness, we introduce a hybrid pseudo-labeling strategy that incorporates both prediction confidence and uncertainty under random perturbations, therefore mitigating the influence of erroneous pseudo-labels. Finally, we leverage the idea of curriculum learning to start from annotating easy samples, and gradually explore hard samples as the iteration grows. Extensive experiments on a number of benchmarks demonstrate that our HCPL beats various state-of-the-art baselines in diverse settings.",

      "abstract": "Translation distance based knowledge graph embedding (KGE) methods, such as TransE and RotatE, model the relation in knowledge graphs as translation or rotation in the vector space. Both translation and rotation are injective; that is, the translation or rotation of different vectors results in different results. In knowledge graphs, different entities may have a relation with the same entity; for example, many actors starred in one movie. Such a non-injective relation pattern cannot be well modeled by the translation or rotation operations in existing translation distance based KGE methods. To tackle the challenge, we propose a translation distance-based KGE method called SpaceE to model relations as linear transformations. The proposed SpaceE embeds both entities and relations in knowledge graphs as matrices and SpaceE naturally models non-injective relations with singular linear transformations. We theoretically demonstrate that SpaceE is a fully expressive model with the ability to infer multiple desired relation patterns, including symmetry, skew-symmetry, inversion, Abelian composition, and non-Abelian composition. Experimental results on link prediction datasets illustrate that SpaceE substantially outperforms many previous translation distance based knowledge graph embedding methods, especially on datasets with many non-injective relations. The code is available based on the PaddlePaddle deep learning platform https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/.",

      "abstract": "Due to the rapid development of technology and the widespread usage of smartphones, the number of mobile applications is exponentially growing. Finding a suitable collection of apps that aligns with users’ needs and preferences can be challenging. However, mobile app recommender systems have emerged as a helpful tool in simplifying this process. But there is a drawback to employing app recommender systems. These systems need access to user data, which is a serious security violation. While users seek accurate opinions, they do not want to compromise their privacy in the process. We address this issue by developing SAppKG, an end-to- end user privacy-preserving knowledge graph architecture for mobile app recommendation based on knowledge graph models such as SAppKG-S and SAppKG-D, that utilized the interaction data and side information of app attributes. We tested the proposed model on real-world data from the Google Play app store, using precision, recall, mean absolute precision, and mean reciprocal rank. We found that the proposed model improved results on all four metrics. We also compared the proposed model to baseline models and found that it outperformed them on all four metrics.",

Most of the existing methods rely heavily on manually engineered domain knowledge, therefore, lack generalization and are inefficient. Moreover, previous methods mainly ignore the cold-start scenario(also known as the inductive setting), which requires the DDI prediction for new drugs. Previous works indicated that drugs with similar molecular structures may have similar chemical properties. In this paper, we proposed a DDI prediction model, Molecular SubStructure-based Cross-Dependent Network for Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction(MSSCD-DDI). MSSCD-DDI generates the representations of drugs from only raw molecular without other high-level features limited by expert knowledge which can not be applied to new drugs. We adopt a cross-dependent scheme to pass messages between the relevance of substructure reactions between two drugs. MSSCD-DDI made effective and accurate predictions, which achieved up to more than 99% in the transductive setting and 8.39% improvement than the SOTA method in the inductive setting(cold start scenario).",

      "abstract": "Relation Extraction is concentrated on finding the unknown relational facts automatically from the unstructured texts. Most current methods, especially the distant supervision relation extraction (DSRE), have been successfully applied to achieve this goal. DSRE combines knowledge graph and text corpus to corporately generate plenty of labeled data without human efforts. However, the existing methods of DSRE ignore the noisy words within sentences and suffer from the noisy labelling problem; the additional knowledge is represented in a common semantic space and ignores the semantic-space difference between relations and entities. To address these problems, this study proposes a novel hierarchical attention model, named the Bi-GRU-based Knowledge Graph Attention Model (BG2KGA) for DSRE using the Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) network. BG2KGA contains the word-level and sentence-level attentions with the guidance of additional knowledge graph, to highlight the key words and sentences respectively which can contribute more to the final relation representations. Further-more, the additional knowledge graph are embedded in the multi-semantic vector space to capture the relations in 1-N, N-1 and N-N entity pairs. Experiments are conducted on a widely used dataset for distant supervision. The experimental results have shown that the proposed model outperforms the current methods and can improve the Precision/Recall (PR) curve area by 8% to 16% compared to the state-of-the-art models; the AUC of BG2KGA can reach 0.468 in the best case.",

      "abstract": "Recently, Electronic Health Records (EHR) have become valuable for enhancing medical decision making, as well as online disease detection and monitoring. Meanwhile, deep learning-based methods have achieved great success in health risk prediction and diagnosis prediction based on EHR. Nevertheless, deep learning-based models usually require high volumes of data due to the vast amount of parameters. In addition, a considerable proportion of medical codes appear rarely in the EHR data which poses huge difficulties for clinical applications. Hence, some works propose to adopt medical ontologies to enhance the prediction performance and provide interpretable prediction results. However, these medical ontologies are often small-scale and coarse-grained, most of diagnoses and medical concepts are not included, lacking many diagnoses and medical concepts, let alone various relationships between these concepts. To overcome this limitation, we propose to incorporate existing large-scale medical knowledge graphs (KGs) into diagnosis prediction and devise a Stage-aware Hierarchical Attentive Relational Network, named HAR. Specifically, for each visit, a personalized sub-KG is extracted from the existing medical KG, on which HAR conducts relation-specific message passing and hierarchical message aggregation to refine representations of nodes that correspond to medical codes in visits. HAR takes the specific stage of a patient's disease progression into consideration, which participates in the computation of relation-level and node-level attention. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAR in improving both the visit-level precision and code-level accuracy of the diagnosis prediction task.",

However, existing ZSL methods that utilize KGs all neglect the intrinsic complexity of inter-class relationships represented in KGs. One typical feature is that a class is often related to other classes in different semantic aspects. In this paper, we focus on ontologies for augmenting ZSL, and propose to learn disentangled ontology embeddings guided by ontology properties to capture and utilize more fine-grained class relationships in different aspects. We also contribute a new ZSL framework named DOZSL, which contains two new ZSL solutions based on generative models and graph propagation models, respectively, for effectively utilizing the disentangled ontology embeddings. Extensive evaluations have been conducted on five benchmarks across zero-shot image classification (ZS-IMGC) and zero-shot KG completion (ZS-KGC).

      "abstract": "Preference logical reasoning utilizes user-item interactions (e.g., ratings and reviews) to infer user preferences and discover user decision paths from the knowledge graph to enhance the explainability of item recommendations. However, existing algorithms assume that the ratings and reviews of any item are always consistent, ignoring situations where items with high ratings have negative reviews or items with low ratings but positive reviews. This leads to inaccurate learning of user preferences. In fact, through experimental analysis of two real datasets, we found that on average, about 10% of the interactive data exhibited this inconsistency, that is, items with high ratings but negative reviews appear in the recommendation list. To address this issue, we propose a general preference logical reasoning method based on preference operators. Specifically, we capture the semantic information of users towards the item (its corresponding attributes) in reviews and define two preference operators (like and dislike) for the item to correct ambiguous neutral ratings or false ratings that do not reflect true preferences. In the process of preference path reasoning, the like preference operator increases the occurrence probability of liked items, while the dislike preference operator reduces the occurrence probability of disliked items. By fusing the preference operators in the preference path, we obtain consistent user preferences and enhance the explainability of item recommendations. The experimental results on four real datasets demonstrate that our method can effectively improve the performance of all comparison baselines in terms of recommendation accuracy and user decision explainability.",

This paper introduces an innovative approach aimed at enhancing knowledge graph reasoning by addressing the issue of predicate polysemy. Predicate polysemy refers to instances where a predicate possesses multiple meanings, introducing ambiguity into the knowledge graph. We present an adaptable optimization framework that effectively addresses predicate polysemy, thereby enhancing reasoning capabilities within knowledge graphs. Our approach serves as a versatile and generalized framework applicable to any reasoning model, offering a scalable and flexible solution to enhance performance across various domains and applications. Through rigorous experimental evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our methodology, showing significant improvements in knowledge graph reasoning accuracy. Our findings underscore that discerning predicate polysemy is a crucial step towards achieving a more dependable and efficient knowledge graph reasoning process.

However, existing methods for knowledge graph embedding fail to consider the influence of the embedding space, which makes them still unsatisfactory in practical applications. In this study, we try to improve the expressiveness of the embedding space from the perspective of the metric. Specifically, we first point out the implications of Minkowski metric used in KG embedding and then make a quantitative analysis. To solve the limitations, we introduce a new metric, named Cycle metric, based on the oscillation property of the periodic function. Furthermore, we find that the function period has a significant influence on the expressiveness of the embedding space. Given a fully trained model, the smaller the period, the better the expressive ability. Finally, to validate the findings, we propose a new model, named CyclE by combining Cycle Metric and the popular KG embeddings models. Comprehensive experimental results show that Cycle is more appropriate than Minkowski for KG embedding.",

      "abstract": "Computer science (CS) plays a crucial role in addressing challenges across various sectors, including education, finance, and healthcare. Investigating scholars’ topic switching behavior quantitatively is essential for understanding the driving forces behind technological development in CS. However, the continuous growth of scientific publications poses challenges in accurately tracking scholars’ topic switching. To address this, this study utilizes a large-scale dataset from the Microsoft Academic Knowledge Graph (MAKG) to construct bibliographic coupling networks for 16,794 scholars, enabling the detection of their research topics using the Louvain algorithm. Subsequently, this study introduces a novel two-dimensional metric to quantify scholars’ topic switching behavior: topic switching degree and topic switching probability. This metric enables the classification of scholars into four distinct types: Type A, Type B, Type C, and Type D. Our analysis reveals that the majority of scholars belong to Type B, characterized by high topic switching probability but low degree, correlating with the highest quantity, quality, and citations of publications. Scholars categorized as Type A and Type D follow, while those falling under Type C, indicating low topic switching probability but high degree, tend to have the lowest publications and citations. Employing these new two-dimensional indicators to measure scholars’ topic switching behavior and exploring its relationship with research performance contribute to advancements in technology within the field of computer science.",

Thus, the task of Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion (TKGC) has attracted increasing attention, aiming to predict missing items based on the available information. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of TKGC methods and their details. Specifically, this paper mainly consists of three components, namely, 1)Background, which covers the preliminaries of TKGC methods, loss functions required for training, as well as the dataset and evaluation protocol; 2)Interpolation, that estimates and predicts the missing elements or set of elements through the relevant available information. It further categorizes related TKGC methods based on how to process temporal information; 3)Extrapolation, which typically focuses on continuous TKGs and predicts future events, and then classifies all extrapolation methods based on the algorithms they utilize. We further pinpoint the challenges and discuss future research directions of TKGC.",

      "abstract": "Building accurate human behavior models is necessary for ambient intelligence. However, human activity recognition (HAR) in continuously monitored physical space meets many challenges to achieve a good performance when using only simple computing resources. In this work, we model HAR as an edge classification problem for a collaborative event graph of context entities in a sequential bipartite graph form. We design a semantic learning framework, called KGAR, to perform HAR by mining, encoding, and exploiting deep semantic knowledge of activities in an end-to-end fashion. KGAR has three components: preprocessor, KGEncoder, and predictor. The preprocessor builds offline a tiny knowledge graph of activities, to model and capture multidimensional semantic relationships between activities and core context entities. KGEncoder encodes the knowledge graph of activities using improved graph neural networks (GNNs) models, to handle confusing context patterns. The predictor may be deployed using some lightweight deep neural network to produce real-time labels. Experimental results show that using KGEncoder in KGAR improves the performance of original deep neural networks by 25% - 439% on five datasets. The time of labeling each sensor event during testing with event streams is less than 0.5 ms. We have also conducted extensive experimental study to show that KGAR outperforms different types of models in more complex activity scenarios. We believe KGAR can be used for real-time HAR in real life with its high prediction performance and a low computing requirement.",

      "abstract": "Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion (TKGC) involves predicting and filling in missing facts within time series data, a crucial task with wide-ranging applications across various domains. The dynamic evolution of Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) adds complexity to this task, making it inherently challenging. Existing research predominantly relies on historical data to complete the missing facts. However, these approaches often overlook the potential of future information and the significance of node weights.To address these challenges, we propose Neo-TKGC, a novel temporal knowledge graph completion model that integrates a graph structure encoding module and a temporal encoding module. The graph structure encoding module introduces node weights to enhance the capabilities of graph neural networks (GNNs) for entity and relation representation learning, implemented using CompGCN. This module can be easily extended to any GNN models utilizing node and edge aggregation. The temporal encoding module leverages both future and historical information to capture relevant contexts and temporal dependencies among entities and relations.By combining node weights and future information, Neo-TKGC achieves more accurate entity and relation representations, thereby improving the model's ability to infer unknown entities. Extensive experiments on three real-world TKGC datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to existing approaches, achieving at least a 1.7% relative improvement in Hits@1 across most metrics.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate a realistic but underexplored problem, called few-shot temporal knowledge graph reasoning, that aims to predict future facts for newly emerging entities based on extremely limited observations in evolving graphs. It offers practical value in applications that need to derive instant new knowledge about new entities in temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) with minimal supervision. The challenges mainly come from the few-shot and time shift properties of new entities. First, the limited observations associated with them are insufficient for training a model from scratch. Second, the potentially dynamic distributions from the initially observable facts to the future facts ask for explicitly modeling the evolving characteristics of new entities. We correspondingly propose a novel Meta Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (MetaTKGR) framework. Unlike prior work that relies on rigid neighborhood aggregation schemes to enhance low-data entity representation, MetaTKGR dynamically adjusts the strategies of sampling and aggregating neighbors from recent facts for new entities, through temporally supervised signals on future facts as instant feedback. Besides, such a meta temporal reasoning procedure goes beyond existing meta-learning paradigms on static knowledge graphs that fail to handle temporal adaptation with large entity variance. We further provide a theoretical analysis and propose a temporal adaptation regularizer to stabilize the meta temporal reasoning over time. Empirically, extensive experiments on three real-world TKGs demonstrate the superiority of MetaTKGR over state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin.",

Whereas knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a favored tool to mitigate the issue, existing KG-based methods tend to overlook two crucial elements: the intention steering users’ location choices and the high-order topological structure within the KG. In this paper, we craft an Intention-aware Knowledge Graph (IKG) that harmonizes users’ visit histories, movement trajectories, and location categories to model user intentions. Building upon IKG, our novel Intention-aware Knowledge Graph Network (IKGN) delves deeper into the POI recommendation by weighing and propagating node embeddings through an attention mechanism, capturing the unique locational intent of each user. A sequential model like GRU is then employed to ensure a comprehensive representation of users’ short- and long-term location preferences. An empirical study on two real-world datasets validates the effectiveness of our proposed IKGN, with it markedly outshining seven benchmark rival models in both Recall and NDCG metrics.

      "abstract": "Reasoning on Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) aims to predict future events based on historical cues of entities and their relations. However, most existing reasoning methods usually represent the knowledge timeline as discrete points and focus on reasoning from the single-history perspective, such as repetitive events or query-related first-order historical information, which greatly limit the improvement of reasoning accuracy, especially for fine-grained TKGs with dense timestamps. To address these issues, Multi-History Perspective Network (MuHiNet) is proposed for temporal knowledge reasoning on TKGs, and it takes three historical perspectives into reasoning, namely neighbor history, repetitive history and sequential history, which directly obtains entity representations at any temporal granularity through dynamic entity embeddings for the prediction of future events. It represents entity embeddings as continuous functions of time. Furthermore, it considers the influence of time duration to derive the final entity representations. MuHi-Net contains four modules, the base intensity module, the neighbor historical intensity module, the repetitive historical intensity module and sequential historical intensity module. The base score of event occurrence is firstly calculated by the base module, then the impact of historical facts on the current event are evaluated by the other three modules. The final inference result is obtained based on integrating scores from these four modules. The experiments on three datasets have highlighted the superiority of MuHi-Net. Specifically, on self-built SMOE dataset, MuHi-Net has achieved significant improvement on predictive accuracy in scenarios with dense timestamps by effectively utilizing historical information from multiple perspectives.",

Nevertheless, existing semantic communication systems struggle to handle information with complex relational semantics. Motivated by this limitation, this article proposes the n-ary relation semantic communication system with correction and reasoning (NRSC-CR). In NRSC-CR, semantic information is extracted from transmitted texts into n-ary relations. To enhance robustness against wireless channel influence, a correction algorithm based on the rationality of primary triplets and auxiliary information pairs (CPA) is introduced at the receiver. Furthermore, by deeply learning the interactions within and between n-ary relations, a reasoning algorithm based on global and local dependency (RGL) is proposed to address the performance degradation caused by excessive influence under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed NRSC-CR has advantages in understanding complex relational semantics, channel robustness, and data transmission efficiency.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enhance recommendations by providing external connectivity between items. However, there is limited research on distilling relevant knowledge in sequential recommendation, where item connections can change over time. To address this, we introduce the Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG), which incorporates such dynamic features of user behaviors into the original KG while emphasizing sequential relationships. The TKG captures both patterns of entity dynamics (nodes) and structural dynamics (edges). Considering real-world applications with large-scale and rapidly evolving user behavior patterns, we propose an efficient two-phase framework called TKG-SRec, which strengthens Sequential Recommendation with Temporal KGs. In the first phase, we learn dynamic entity embeddings using our novel Knowledge Evolution Network (KEN) that brings together pretrained static knowledge with evolving temporal knowledge. In the second stage, downstream sequential recommender models utilize these time-specific dynamic entity embeddings with compatible neural backbones like GRUs, Transformers, and MLPs. From our extensive experiments over four datasets, TKG-SRec outperforms the current state-of-the-art by a statistically significant 5% on average. Detailed analysis validates that such filtered temporal knowledge better adapts entity embedding for sequential recommendation. In summary, TKG-SRec provides an effective and efficient approach.",

      "abstract": "Multi-hop path query answering is a complex task in which a path needs to be inferred from a knowledge graph that contains a head entity and multi-hop relations. The objective is to identify the corresponding tail entity accurately. The representation of the path is a critical factor in this task. However, existing methods do not adequately consider the context information of the entities and relations in the path. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel multi-hop path query answering model that utilizes an enhanced reasoning path feature representation to incorporate intermediate entity information and improve the accuracy of path query answering. The proposed model utilizes the neighborhood to aggregate the entity representation in the reasoning path. It employs a recurrent skipping network to splice the embedding of the relationship and the entity in the reasoning path based on their weight. Additionally, the model adds the position representation to obtain the reasoning path representation. Moreover, the model uses Bi-GRU and Transformer to obtain the local and global context features of each entity in the reasoning path. Finally, the reasoning path feature representation is input into the feedforward neural network and predicted through the softmax layer. The effectiveness of the proposed model in addressing the multi-hop path query answering task is demonstrated by experimental results on the WN18RR and FB15K-237 datasets. Specifically, the proposed model outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Graph embedding (GE) aims to acquire low-dimensional node representations while maintaining the graph’s structural and semantic attributes. Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) signify a noteworthy achievement in the fusion of AI and education. Utilizing GE to model ITS can elevate their performance in predictive and annotation tasks. Current GE techniques, whether applied to heterogeneous or dynamic graphs, struggle to efficiently model ITS data. The GEs within ITS should retain their semidynamic, independent, and smooth characteristics. This article introduces a heterogeneous evolution network (HEN) for illustrating entities and relations within an ITS. Additionally, we introduce a temporal extension graph neural network (TEGNN) to model both evolving and static nodes within the HEN. In the TEGNN framework, dynamic nodes are initially improved over time through temporal extension (TE), providing an accurate depiction of each learner’s implicit state at each time step. Subsequently, we propose a stochastic temporal pooling (STP) strategy to estimate the embedding sets of all evolving nodes. This effectively enhances model efficiency and usability. Following this, a heterogeneous aggregation network is devised to proficiently extract heterogeneous features from the HEN. This network employs both node-level and relation-level attention mechanisms to craft aggregated node features. To emphasize the superiority of TEGNN, we perform experiments on several real ITS datasets and show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. The experiments validate that TE serves as an efficient framework for modeling temporal information in GE, and STP not only accelerates the training process but also enhances the resultant accuracy.",

      "abstract": "The exponential growth of scientific literature challenges researchers extracting and synthesizing knowledge. Traditional search engines return many sources without direct, detailed answers, while general-purpose LLMs may offer concise responses that lack depth or omit current information. LLMs with search capabilities are also limited by context window, yielding short, incomplete answers. This paper introduces WISE (Workflow for Intelligent Scientific Knowledge Extraction), a system addressing these limits by using a structured workflow to extract, refine, and rank query-specific knowledge. WISE uses an LLM-powered, tree-based architecture to refine data, focusing on query-aligned, context-aware, and non-redundant information. Dynamic scoring and ranking prioritize unique contributions from each source, and adaptive stopping criteria minimize processing overhead. WISE delivers detailed, organized answers by systematically exploring and synthesizing knowledge from diverse sources. Experiments on HBB gene-associated diseases demonstrate WISE reduces processed text by over 80% while achieving significantly higher recall over baselines like search engines and other LLM-based approaches. ROUGE and BLEU metrics reveal WISE's output is more unique than other systems, and a novel level-based metric shows it provides more in-depth information. We also explore how the WISE workflow can be adapted for diverse domains like drug discovery, material science, and social science, enabling efficient knowledge extraction and synthesis from unstructured scientific papers and web sources.",

      "abstract": "The use of Elastic Stack (ELK) solutions and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) has attracted a lot of attention lately, with promises of vastly improving business performance based on new business insights and better decisions. This allows organizations not only to reap the ultimate benefits of data governance but also to consider the widest possible range of relevant information when deciding their next steps. In this paper, we examine how data management and data visualization are used in organizations that use ELK solutions to collect integrated data from different sources in one place and visualize and analyze them in near-real time. We also present some interpretable Knowledge Graphs, GRAPHYP, which are innovative by processing an analytical information geometry and can be used together with an ELK to improve data quality and visualize the data to make informed decisions in organizations. Good decisions are the backbone of successful organizations. Ultimately, this research is about integrating a combined solution between ELK and SKG GRAPHYP and showing users the advantages in this area.",

To address this issue, this study explores the potential of knowledge graph reasoning as a more adaptable and sophisticated approach to identify and counter network attacks. By leveraging graph structures imbued with human‐like thinking, this method enhances the resilience of cybersecurity systems. The study focuses on three critical aspects: data preparation, semantic foundations, and knowledge graph inference techniques. Through an in‐depth analysis of these components, the research aims to reveal how knowledge graph reasoning can improve cyberattack detection and enhance the overall efficacy of cybersecurity measures, including intrusion detection systems. The proposed approach has undergone extensive experimentation to validate its effectiveness compared to existing methods. The results of the experiment have shown a remarkable advancement in accuracy, speed, and recall for recognition, surpassing current methods.

      "abstract": "Many graph embedding approaches have been proposed for knowledge graph completion via link prediction. Among those, translating embedding approaches enjoy the advantages of light-weight structure, high efficiency and great interpretability. Especially when extended to complex vector space, they show the capability in handling various relation patterns including symmetry, antisymmetry, inversion and composition. However, previous translating embedding approaches defined in complex vector space suffer from two main issues: 1) representing and modeling capacities of the model are limited by the translation function with rigorous multiplication of two complex numbers; and 2) embedding ambiguity caused by one-to-many relations is not explicitly alleviated. In this paper, we propose a relation-adaptive translation function built upon a novel weighted product in complex space, where the weights are learnable, relation-specific and independent to embedding size. The translation function only requires eight more scalar parameters each relation, but improves expressive power and alleviates embedding ambiguity problem. Based on the function, we then present our Relation-adaptive translating Embedding (RatE) approach to score each graph triple. Moreover, a novel negative sampling method is proposed to utilize both prior knowledge and self-adversarial learning for effective optimization. Experiments verify RatE achieves state-of-the-art performance on four link prediction benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) reasoning has two settings: interpolation reasoning and extrapolation reasoning. Both of them draw plenty of research interest and have great significance. Methods of the former de-emphasize the temporal correlations among facts sequences, while methods of the latter require strict chronological order of knowledge and ignore inferring clues provided by missing facts of the past. These limit the practicability of TKG applications as almost all of the existing TKG reasoning methods are designed specifically to address either one setting. To this end, this paper proposes an original Temporal PAth-based Reasoning (TPAR) model for both the interpolation and extrapolation reasoning. TPAR performs a neural-driven symbolic reasoning fashion that is robust to ambiguous and noisy temporal data and with fine interpretability as well. Comprehensive experiments show that TPAR outperforms SOTA methods on the link prediction task for both the interpolation and the extrapolation settings. A novel pipeline experimental setting is designed to evaluate the performances of SOTA combinations and the proposed TPAR towards interpolation and extrapolation reasoning. More diverse experiments are conducted to show the robustness and interpretability of TPAR.",

      "abstract": "The recently explosive growth of Super Apps brings great convenience to people's daily life by providing a wide variety of services through mini-programs, including online shopping, travel, finance, and so on. Due to the considerable gap between various scenarios, the restriction of effective information transfer and sharing severely blocks the efficient delivery of online services, potentially affecting the user's app experience. To deeply understand users' needs, we propose SupKG, a commonsense knowledge graph towards Super APP to help comprehensively characterize user behaviors across different business scenarios. In particular, our SupKG is carefully established from multiplex and heterogeneous data source in Alipay (a well-known Super App in China), which also emphasize abundant spatiotemporal relations and intent-related entities to answer the fundamental question in life service ''which service do users need at what time and where''. On the hand, the successful application of SupKG hinges on the effective form of network representation ie Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE). However, a series of unsatisfying issues still need to be carefully considered in the industrial environment: i) bridging language representations with knowledge structure in a unified manner, ii) alleviating the skewed data distribution in SupKG, and iii) effectively characterizing hierarchical structures in SupKG. With these motivations, we develop a novel knowledge graph representation learning framework for SupKG, enabling various downstream applications to benefit from learned representations of entities and relations. Extensive experiments on the standard knowledge graph completion task demonstrate the consistent and significant performance improvement of our representation learning framework, which also greatly benefits the supplementation of potential knowledge of SupKG. Towards real-world applications in Alipay, our SupKG and learned representations show the potential superiority of integrating global behaviors in cold-start scenarios and providing high-quality knowledge for warming up the graph-based ranking.",

To address these problems, we introduce a multi-hop neighbor aggregator based on CNN which designs to make comprehensive use of neighbor information. Additionally, we employ contrastive learning to reduce the semantic distance between similar entities.

Predicting time-aware entities is a challenging task due to significant differences in entity appearances over time, such as different timestamps and frequencies. Current embedding-based similarity-matching methods have been introduced for predicting temporal facts. However, they lack deterministic logical explainability and cannot model the dynamic evolution of entities over time. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for temporal knowledge graph reasoning based on multi-view feature fusion (MVFF). First, MVFF extracts logical rules and uses the Gumbel-Softmax trick to sample high-quality rules. Second, it integrates logical rules, temporal quadruples, and factual triples to capture semantic features, temporal information, and structural information to solve link prediction tasks. Through experiments on four benchmark datasets, we show that MVFF outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing not only better performance but also interpretable results.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, with the large-scale expansion of graph data, there has been an increased focus on Riemannian manifold data spaces other than Euclidean space. In particular, the development of hyperbolic spaces has been remarkable, and they have high expressive power for graph data with hierarchical structures. Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) is employed in regret minimization and model selection. However, existing formulations of NML have been developed primarily in Euclidean spaces and are inherently dependent on the choice of coordinate systems, making it non-trivial to extend NML to Riemannian manifolds. In this study, we define a new NML that reflects the geometric structure of Riemannian manifolds, called the Riemannian manifold NML (Rm-NML). This Rm-NML is invariant under coordinate transformations and coincides with the conventional NML under the natural parameterization in Euclidean space. We extend existing computational techniques for NML to the setting of Riemannian manifolds. Furthermore, we derive a method to simplify the computation of Rm-NML on Riemannian symmetric spaces, which encompass data spaces of growing interest such as hyperbolic spaces. To illustrate the practical application of our proposed method, we explicitly computed the Rm-NML for normal distributions on hyperbolic spaces.",

A pivotal challenge resides in chatbots' innate incapacity to seamlessly integrate changes within their knowledge base, thereby hindering their ability to provide real-time responses. The increasing literature attention dedicated to effective knowledge base updates, which we term content update, underscores the significance of this topic. This work provides an overview of content update methodologies in the context of conversational agents. We delve into the state-of-the-art approaches for natural language understanding, such as language models and alike, which are essential for turning data into knowledge. Additionally, we discuss turning point strategies and primary resources, such as deep learning, which are crucial for supporting language models.

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) comprise entities interconnected by relations of different semantic meanings. KGs are being used in a wide range of applications. However, they inherently suffer from incompleteness, i.e. entities or facts about entities are missing. Consequently, a larger body of works focuses on the completion of missing information in KGs, which is commonly referred to as link prediction (LP). This task has traditionally and extensively been studied in the transductive setting, where all entities and relations in the testing set are observed during training. Recently, several works have tackled the LP task under more challenging settings, where entities and relations in the test set may be unobserved during training, or appear in only a few facts. These works are known as inductive, few-shot, and zero-shot link prediction. In this work, we conduct a systematic review of existing works in this area. A thorough analysis leads us to point out the undesirable existence of diverging terminologies and task definitions for the aforementioned settings, which further limits the possibility of comparison between recent works. We consequently aim at dissecting each setting thoroughly, attempting to reveal its intrinsic characteristics. A unifying nomenclature is ultimately proposed to refer to each of them in a simple and consistent manner.",

Existing KGE models typically map entities and relations into a unified continuous vector space and define a score function to capture the connectivity patterns among the elements (entities and relations) of facts. The score on a fact measures its plausibility in a knowledge graph (KG). However, since the connectivity patterns are very complex in a real knowledge graph, it is difficult to define an explicit and efficient score function to capture them, which also limits their performance. This paper argues that plausible facts in a knowledge graph come from a distribution in the low-dimensional fact space. Inspired by this insight, this paper proposes a novel framework called Fact Embedding through Diffusion Model (FDM) to address the knowledge graph completion task. Instead of defining a score function to measure the plausibility of facts in a knowledge graph, this framework directly learns the distribution of plausible facts from the known knowledge graph and casts the entity prediction task into the conditional fact generation task. Specifically, we concatenate the elements embedding in a fact as a whole and take it as input. Then, we introduce a Conditional Fact Denoiser to learn the reverse denoising diffusion process and generate the target fact embedding from noised data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FDM significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in three benchmark datasets.",

      "abstract": "Recent Continual Learning (CL)-based Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (TKGR) methods focus on significantly reducing computational cost and mitigating catastrophic forgetting caused by fine-tuning models with new data. However, existing CL-based TKGR methods still face two key limitations: (1) They usually one-sidedly reorganize individual historical facts, while overlooking the historical context essential for accurately understanding the historical semantics of these facts; (2) They preserve historical knowledge by simply replaying historical facts, while ignoring the potential conflicts between historical and emerging facts. In this paper, we propose a Deep Generative Adaptive Replay (DGAR) method, which can generate and adaptively replay historical entity distribution representations from the whole historical context. To address the first challenge, historical context prompts as sampling units are built to preserve the whole historical context information. To overcome the second challenge, a pre-trained diffusion model is adopted to generate the historical distribution. During the generation process, the common features between the historical and current distributions are enhanced under the guidance of the TKGR model. In addition, a layer-by-layer adaptive replay mechanism is designed to effectively integrate historical and current distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that DGAR significantly outperforms baselines in reasoning and mitigating forgetting.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE), which projects entities and relations into continuous vector spaces, has garnered significant attention. Although high-dimensional KGE methods offer better performance, they come at the expense of significant computation and memory overheads. Decreasing embedding dimensions significantly deteriorates model performance. While several recent efforts utilize knowledge distillation or non-Euclidean representation learning to augment the effectiveness of low-dimensional KGE, they either necessitate a pre-trained high-dimensional teacher model or involve complex non-Euclidean operations, thereby incurring considerable additional computational costs. To address this, this work proposes Confidence-aware Self-Knowledge Distillation (CSD) that learns from the model itself to enhance KGE in a low-dimensional space. Specifically, CSD extracts knowledge from embeddings in previous iterations, which would be utilized to supervise the learning of the model in the next iterations. Moreover, a specific semantic module is developed to filter reliable knowledge by estimating the confidence of previously learned embeddings. This straightforward strategy bypasses the need for time-consuming pre-training of teacher models and can be integrated into various KGE methods to improve their performance. Our comprehensive experiments on six KGE backbones and four datasets underscore the effectiveness of the proposed CSD.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge reasoning methods play a pivotal role in various applications, including knowledge graph completion, knowledge-based question answering, and knowledge recommendation. Among these methods, path-based multi-hop reasoning techniques have the ability to leverage the rich graph information in knowledge graphs beyond triplets, but they still encounter certain challenges. Existing multi-hop knowledge reasoning methods heavily rely on data and lack interpretability. Additionally, the vast exploration space of paths, composed of numerous entities and relations in large knowledge graphs, often leads to irrelevant and redundant exploration. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel knowledge reasoning method named ALMARL (Attention-based LSTM and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Knowledge Graph Reasoning). It utilizes Attention-based LSTM in conjunction with multi-agent reinforcement learning. The method first employs clustering techniques to group entities. Based on the clustering results, multi-agents at different levels are established to selectively explore certain clusters or limit the search to specific clusters, effectively reducing the exploration of irrelevant entities and minimizing redundant exploration. Subsequently, the agents efficiently explore paths and effectively mine deep semantic information in entity relationships through the integration of Attention-based LSTM. Finally, the model produces inference results and extracts interpretable paths. We evaluate our proposed model on two types of tasks: link prediction and fact prediction. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to several competitive baselines.",

      "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are often used for the task of link prediction: predicting missing binary facts in knowledge graphs (KGs). To address the lack of explainability of GNNs on KGs, recent works extract Datalog rules from GNNs with provable correspondence guarantees. The extracted rules can be used to explain the GNN's predictions; furthermore, they can help characterise the expressive power of various GNN models. However, these works address only a form of link prediction based on a restricted, low-expressivity graph encoding/decoding method. In this paper, we consider a more general and popular approach for link prediction where a scoring function is used to decode the GNN output into fact predictions. We show how GNNs and scoring functions can be adapted to be monotonic, use the monotonicity to extract sound rules for explaining predictions, and leverage existing results about the kind of rules that scoring functions can capture. We also define procedures for obtaining equivalent Datalog programs for certain classes of monotonic GNNs with scoring functions. Our experiments show that, on link prediction benchmarks, monotonic GNNs and scoring functions perform well in practice and yield many sound rules.",

      "abstract": "Relation prediction in knowledge graphs (KGs) aims to anticipate the connections between entities. While both transductive and inductive models are incorporated for context comprehension, we need to focus on two primary issues. First, these models only collate relations at each layer of the subgraph, overlooking the potential sequential relationship between different layers. Second, these methods overlook the homogeneity of subgraphs, thus impeding their ability to effectively learn the importance of relationships within the subgraphs. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical and homogenous subgraph learning model for KG relation prediction (HiHo). Specifically, we adopt a subgraph-to-sequence mechanism to learn the potential semantic associations between layers in the subgraph of a single entity, and thus model the hierarchy of the subgraph. Then, we implement a common preference inference mechanism that assigns higher weights to co-occurrence relations while learning the importance of each relation in the subgraphs of two entities, and thus models the homogeneity of the subgraph. In our study, we sequentially employ induction on each layer of subgraphs pertaining to the two entities for relation prediction. To assess the efficacy of our method, we perform experiments on five publicly available datasets. The results of our experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses the current state-of-the-art baselines in both transductive and inductive settings.",

      "abstract": "Multi-domain recommendation (MDR) aims to provide recommendations for different domains (e.g., types of products) with overlapping users/items and is common for platforms such as Amazon, Facebook, and LinkedIn that host multiple services. Existing MDR models face two challenges: First, it is difficult to disentangle knowledge that generalizes across domains (e.g., a user likes cheap items) and knowledge specific to a single domain (e.g., a user likes blue clothing but not blue cars). Second, they have limited ability to transfer knowledge across domains with small overlaps. We propose a new MDR method named EDDA with two key components, i.e., embedding disentangling recommender and domain alignment, to tackle the two challenges respectively. In particular, the embedding disentangling recommender separates both the model and embedding for the inter-domain part and the intra-domain part, while most existing MDR methods only focus on model-level disentangling. The domain alignment leverages random walks from graph processing to identify similar user/item pairs from different domains and encourages similar user/item pairs to have similar embeddings, enhancing knowledge transfer. We compare EDDA with 12 state-of-the-art baselines on 3 real datasets. The results show that EDDA consistently outperforms the baselines on all datasets and domains.

      "abstract": "Inductive relation prediction aims to predict missing connections between entities unseen during training. Recent approaches adopt binary (positive or negative) training labels, which indicate whether the query relation exists between the entities, as supervision to teach models recognizing the entity-independent relation patterns in the context (enclosed subgraph or connective path). However, we argue that in this kind of method, the trained models are guided to make relation predictions by remembering whether the query relation and its contextual relational pattern co-occur more frequently in positive or negative samples. This solution could introduce two major limitations: 1) the model struggles with long-tail combinations, i.e., the combination between query relation and the relational pattern rarely occurs during training; 2) when noisy relational patterns, which fail to provide evidence for predicting the query relation, frequently occur with the query relation in positive training samples, the model will be misled into considering the noisy relational patterns as a feature supporting the existence of the query relation. To solve these problems, we propose ToC (Thinking on Context). ToC first utilizes large language models (LLMs) to incorporate a chain of thought as an additional supervisory constraint, guiding the model to make relational predictions based on logical reasoning instead of co-occurrence frequency. Additionally, ToC employs the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to construct context-level negative samples, aiding the model in identifying and disregarding noisy relational patterns. Extensive experiments show that ToC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across three widely used datasets in multiple inductive settings.",

However, most existing embedding methods do not fully consider the rich semantic and structural features contained in the knowledge graph, leading to poor feature expression and affecting the accuracy of downstream tasks. To address this problem, we propose a knowledge graph embedding method ISSKE that integrates semantic and structural features. First, we use the ALBERT pre-training model to embed the textual description information of entities and relations. Then, we propose a relation-weighted graph convolutional neural network model R-WGCN to learn the embedding representation of entities and relations simultaneously. Finally, we put forward Conv-Internal as the decoder, which uses internal embedding to construct 2D convolutional filters. Conv-Internal can not only promote the interaction between entities and relations but also significantly reduce the number of parameters and improve the training and inference efficiency. The experimental results show that the performance of this model on tasks such as triple classification and link prediction is better than that of baseline methods.

Legend is built on a foundation of efficient data placement and retrieval strategies tailored to the unique strengths of each hardware. Key innovations include a prefetch-friendly embedding loading strategy, enabling GPUs to directly prefetch data from SSDs with minimal I/O overhead, and a high-throughput GPU-SSD direct access driver optimized for graph embedding tasks. Furthermore, we propose a customized parallel execution strategy to maximize GPU utilization, ensuring efficient handling of billion-scale datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Legend achieves up to 4.8x speedup compared to state-of-the-art systems. Moreover, Legend exhibits comparable performance on a single GPU to that of the state-of-the-art system using 4 GPUs on the billion-scale dataset.",

      "title": "Sentence-level Distant Supervision Relation Extraction based on Dynamic Soft Labels",
      "abstract": "Distant supervision is widely used in relation extraction because it can automatically annotate data based on existing Knowledge Graph and corpus. Inevitably, it also results in noisy labels problem. In order to address the problem, the usual method is to put all sentences with the same entity pair in a bag, set bag-level label for them, and perform relation prediction on bag-level. However, in some downstream tasks such as question answering and semantic parsing, accurate sentence-level prediction is more important. So in this paper, we conduct study on the sentence-level and propose a novel and efficient sentence-level distant supervision relation extraction framework, SEDSL. Specifically, we adopt soft labels that can be dynamically updated during training phase to provide more accurate supervision signals to alleviate the influence of noisy labels and propose a tighter noise-filtering and re-labeling strategy to identify noisy instances and re-label them. Moreover, SEDSL is independent of the backbone network structure, so it is more general and can be applied to various sentence encoders. Extensive experimental results on NYT-10 dataset show the significant improvement of the proposed framework over all baseline methods on sentence-level relation extraction and noise reduction effect.",

      "abstract": "Ontologies are among the most widely used types of knowledge representation formalisms. The application of deep learning techniques in the field of ontology engineering has reinforced the need to learn and generate representations of ontological data. This allows ontologies to be exploited by such models, and thus automate various ontology engineering tasks, where most of the existing tools and machine learning approaches require a numerical feature vectors associated with each concept. This paper outlines a novel approach for learning global ontology entities embeddings by exploiting the structure and the various taxonomic and semantic relationships present in ontologies, taking into account all the information present in the ontological graph and carried by the OWL/RDF triples. Thus, producing global ontology entities embeddings capturing the global ontological graph semantics and similarities enclosed in the source ontology. Three different neural network models have been proposed based on two architectures: multi-input and multi-output, trained using the contrastive estimation technique. The evaluation on OWL/RDF ontologies and word semantic similarity tasks using various graph and WordNet based similarity measures, show that our approach yields competitive results outperforming the state-of-the-art ontology and word embedding models.",

      "abstract": "The next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation aims to predict users’ future movements based on their historical trajectories. However, in reality, users may provide uncertain check-in records, resulting in uploaded data that lack precise location information and is instead ambiguous. Despite this challenge, only a limited number of studies have addressed this issue, often overlooking the intricate interactions among users, POIs, and POI categories. To that end, we propose a novel model called knowledge-graph-enhanced transformer (KGNext). KGNext leverages transition and interaction graphs derived from our constructed transitional-interactive knowledge graph (TIKG) to uncover both general movement patterns and varied user preferences regarding POIs and POI categories. Furthermore, KGNext integrates comprehensive contextual information from historical trajectories with TIKG to generate user trajectory embeddings. These encoded features are then utilized by a transformer model to provide fine-grained predictions of the next POI. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of KGNext.",

First, user preference representations are learned through a knowledge-aware user encoder that comprehensively captures the genuine, sequential, and flash interests of users reflected in their historical clicked news. Then, a user-perturbed pointer-generator network is devised to accomplish the headline generation in which the learned user representations implicitly affect the word prediction. The proposed model is optimized by reinforcement learning solvers where indicators on factual, personalized, and linguistic aspects of the generated headline are regarded as rewards.

Traditional methods for representation learning have predominantly focused on the structural aspects of triples within the KG.

In this study, we introduce TP-RotatE, an innovative method that leverages the semantic context of triples to effectively capture more intricate relational patterns. Specifically, our model harnesses contextual information surrounding the head entity and distills relevant rules. These rules are then integrated with path information to offer a more holistic perspective on the relationships embedded within complex vector spaces. Furthermore, the synergy between rules and paths empowers the knowledge-embedded model to handle the intricacies of complex relationships. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset confirm that TP-RotatE surpasses current baseline methods in KG inference tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.",

      "title": "Knowledge Graph Pruning for Recommendation",
      "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the prosperity of knowledge graph based recommendation system (KGRS), which enriches the representation of users, items, and entities by structural knowledge with striking improvement. Nevertheless, its unaffordable computational cost still limits researchers from exploring more sophisticated models. We observe that the bottleneck for training efficiency arises from the knowledge graph, which is plagued by the well-known issue of knowledge explosion. Recently, some works have attempted to slim the inflated KG via summarization techniques. However, these summarized nodes may ignore the collaborative signals and deviate from the facts that nodes in knowledge graph represent symbolic abstractions of entities from the real-world. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel approach called KGTrimmer for knowledge graph pruning tailored for recommendation, to remove the unessential nodes while minimizing performance degradation. Specifically, we design an importance evaluator from a dual-view perspective. For the collective view, we embrace the idea of collective intelligence by extracting community consensus based on abundant collaborative signals, i.e. nodes are considered important if they attract attention of numerous users. For the holistic view, we learn a global mask to identify the valueless nodes from their inherent properties or overall popularity. Next, we build an end-to-end importance-aware graph neural network, which injects filtered knowledge to enhance the distillation of valuable user-item collaborative signals. Ultimately, we generate a pruned knowledge graph with lightweight, stable, and robust properties to facilitate the following-up recommendation task. Extensive experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets to prove the effectiveness and generalization ability of KGTrimmer.",

      "abstract": "A knowledge graph is a powerful representation of real-world entities and their relations. The vast majority of these relations are defined as positive statements, but the importance of negative statements is increasingly recognized, especially under an Open World Assumption. Explicitly considering negative statements has been shown to improve performance on tasks such as entity summarization and question answering or domain-specific tasks such as protein function prediction. However, no attention has been given to the exploration of negative statements by knowledge graph embedding approaches despite the potential of negative statements to produce more accurate representations of entities in a knowledge graph. We propose a novel approach, TrueWalks, to incorporate negative statements into the knowledge graph representation learning process. In particular, we present a novel walk-generation method that is able to not only differentiate between positive and negative statements but also take into account the semantic implications of negation in ontology-rich knowledge graphs. This is of particular importance for applications in the biomedical domain, where the inadequacy of embedding approaches regarding negative statements at the ontology level has been identified as a crucial limitation. We evaluate TrueWalks in ontology-rich biomedical knowledge graphs in two different predictive tasks based on KG embeddings: protein-protein interaction prediction and gene-disease association prediction. We conduct an extensive analysis over established benchmarks and demonstrate that our method is able to improve the performance of knowledge graph embeddings on all tasks.",

Convolutional neural networks have recently shown their superiority for this problem, bringing increased model expressiveness while remaining parameter efficient. Despite the success, previous convolution designs fail to model full interactions between input entities and relations, which potentially limits the performance of link prediction. In this work we introduce ConvR, an adaptive convolutional network designed to maximize entity-relation interactions in a convolutional fashion. ConvR adaptively constructs convolution filters from relation representations, and applies these filters across entity representations to generate convolutional features. As such, ConvR enables rich interactions between entity and relation representations at diverse regions, and all the convolutional features generated will be able to capture such interactions. We evaluate ConvR on multiple benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that: (1) ConvR performs substantially better than competitive baselines in almost all the metrics and on all the datasets; (2) Compared with state-of-the-art convolutional models, ConvR is not only more effective but also more efficient. It offers a 7% increase in MRR and a 6% increase in Hits@10, while saving 12% in parameter storage.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph link prediction is crucial for constructing triples in knowledge graphs, which aim to infer whether there is a relation between the entities. Recently, graph neural networks and contrastive learning have demonstrated superior performance compared with traditional translation-based models; they successfully extracted common features through explicit linking between entities. However, the implicit associations between entities without a linking relationship are ignored, which impedes the model from capturing distant but semantically rich entities. In addition, directly applying contrastive learning based on random node dropout to link prediction tasks, or limiting it to triplet-level, leads to constrained model performance. To address these challenges, we design an implicit feature extraction module that utilizes the clustering characteristics of latent vector space to find entities with potential associations and enrich entity representations by mining similar semantic features from the conceptual level. Meanwhile, the subgraph mechanism is introduced to preserve the structural information of explicitly connected entities. Implicit semantic features and explicit structural features serve as complementary information to provide high-quality self-supervised signals. Experiments are conducted on three benchmark knowledge graph datasets. The results validate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in link prediction tasks.",

RelatE employs a real-valued phase-modulus decomposition, leveraging sinusoidal phase alignments to encode relational patterns such as symmetry, inversion, and composition. In contrast to recent approaches based on complex-valued embeddings or deep neural architectures, RelatE preserves architectural simplicity while achieving competitive or superior performance on standard benchmarks. Empirically, RelatE outperforms prior methods across several datasets: on YAGO3-10, it achieves an MRR of 0.521 and Hit@10 of 0.680, surpassing all baselines. Additionally, RelatE offers significant efficiency gains, reducing training time by 24%, inference latency by 31%, and peak GPU memory usage by 22% compared to RotatE. Perturbation studies demonstrate improved robustness, with MRR degradation reduced by up to 61% relative to TransE and by up to 19% compared to RotatE under structural edits such as edge removals and relation swaps. Formal analysis further establishes the model's full expressiveness and its capacity to represent essential first-order logical inference patterns.

      "abstract": "Most existing methods for knowledge graph representation learning primarily focus on structured information and overlook the potential benefits of incorporating multimodal information [14]. Moreover, relying solely on structural triples for learning poses challenges such as insufficient feature semantics, significant gaps between related entities, and low similarity [13]. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multi-modal knowledge graph representation learning method based on hyperplane embedding. Firstly, a graph neural network is used as the structural encoder to learn entity embeddings, while a pre-trained visual model is employed as the image encoder to learn image embeddings. Next, the relationships in each triple are mapped onto hyperplanes, and the entity and visual representations are projected onto the hyperplanes of the relationships to address the multi-relationship data problem. Finally, a cross-translation distance function is utilized to evaluate the probab-ility of the authenticity of each triple and perform link prediction tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of this approach, with a 0.87% improvement in Hits@10 on the WN18-IMG dataset and a 14.5% improvement on the FB15K-IMG dataset compared to similar models.",

The task requires two key competencies: (1) algorithm comprehension: synthesizing information from papers and academic literature to understand implementation logic, and (2) coding expertise: identifying dependencies and correctly implementing necessary APIs. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce SciReplicate-Bench, a benchmark of 100 tasks from 36 NLP papers published in 2024, featuring detailed annotations and comprehensive test cases. Building on SciReplicate-Bench, we propose Sci-Reproducer, a dual-agent framework consisting of a Paper Agent that interprets algorithmic concepts from literature and a Code Agent that retrieves dependencies from repositories and implements solutions. To assess algorithm understanding, we introduce reasoning graph accuracy, which quantifies similarity between generated and reference reasoning graphs derived from code comments and structure. For evaluating implementation quality, we employ execution accuracy, CodeBLEU, and repository dependency/API recall metrics. In our experiments, we evaluate various powerful non-reasoning and reasoning LLMs as foundational models. The best-performing LLM using \\ModelName~achieves only 39% execution accuracy, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty. Our analysis identifies missing or inconsistent algorithm descriptions as key barriers to successful reproduction.

      "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of learning representations of entities and relations in the knowledge graph for the link prediction task. Our idea is based on the observation that the vast majority of the related work only models the relation as a single geometric operation such as translation or rotation, which limits the representation power of the underlying models and makes it harder to match the complicated relations existed in real-world datasets. To embrace a richer set of relational information, we propose a new method called dual quaternion knowledge graph embedding (DualE), which introduces dual quaternions into knowledge graph embeddings. Specifically, a dual quaternion behaves like a “complex quaternion” with its real and imaginary part all being quaternary. The core of DualE lies a specific design of dual-quaternion-based multiplication, which universally models relations as the compositions of a series of translation and rotation operations. The major merits of DualE are three-fold:1) it is the first unified framework embracing both rotation based and translation-based models, 2) it expands the embedding space to the dual quaternion space with a more intuitive physical and geometric interpretation, 3) it satisfies the key patterns and the multiple relations pattern of relational representation learning.

      "abstract": "Anomaly detection plays a crucial role in data security and risk management across various domains, such as financial insurance security, medical image recognition, and Internet of Things (IoT) device management. Researchers rely on machine learning to address potential threats in order to enhance data security. In the financial insurance industry, enterprises tend to leverage the relation mining capabilities of knowledge graph embedding (KGE) for anomaly detection. However, auto insurance fraud labeling strongly relies on manual labeling by experts. The efficiency and cost issues of labeling make auto insurance fraud detection still a small-sample detection challenge. Existing schemes, such as migration learning and data augmentation methods, are susceptible to local characteristics, leading to their poor generalization performance. To improve its generalization, the recently emerging Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) framework provides new ideas for mining more frauds through the joint cooperation of companies. Based on DFL, we propose a federated framework named DFLR for relation embedding aggregation. This framework trains the private KGE of auto insurance companies on the client locally and dynamically selects servers for relation aggregation with the aim of privacy protection. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed DFLR on a real auto insurance dataset. And the results show that the cooperative approach provided by DFLR improves the client’s ability to detect auto insurance fraud compared to single client training.",

Structure-based techniques efficiently capture relational information by embedding both entities and relationships. Description-based methods utilize textual information by employing pre-trained language models (PLMs), enhancing the semantic representation of entities. Nevertheless, the previous description-based methods often overlook the essential relational data within triples, concentrating solely on the semantic details of entity descriptions. In order to overcome this issue, we present a novel approach called Relation-Augmented Knowledge Graph Completion using Pre-trained Language Models (ReAuKGC), which utilizes special relation tokens to enrich the relation information without any additional computational cost. To address entity ambiguity, we introduce a re-ranking method based on structure. The experimental findings indicate that ReAuKGC attains sota performance on the WN18RR benchmark.

      "abstract": "The sparseness and incompleteness of knowledge graphs (KGs) trigger considerable interest in enhancing the representation learning with external corpora. However, the difficulty of aligning entities and relations with external corpora leads to inferior performance improvement. Open knowledge graphs (OKGs) consist of entity-mentions and relation-mentions that are represented by noncanonicalized freeform phrases, which generally do not rely on the specification of ontology schema. The roughness of the nonontological construction method leads to a specific characteristic of OKGs: diversity, where multiple entity-mentions (or relation-mentions) have the same meaning but different expressions. The diversity of OKGs can provide potential textual and structural features for the representation learning of KGs. We speculate that leveraging OKGs to enhance the representation learning of KGs can be more effective than using pure text or pure structure corpora. In this paper, we propose a new OERL, Open knowledge graph Enhanced Representation Learning of KGs. OERL automatically extracts textual and structural connections between KGs and OKGs, models and transfers refined profitable features to enhance the representation learning of KGs. The strong performance improvement and exhaustive experimental analysis prove the superiority of OERL over state-of-the-art baselines.",

To address this critical gap, we propose a novel prompted meta-learning (PromptMeta) framework that seamlessly integrates meta-semantics with relational information for few-shot relational learning. PromptMeta has two key innovations: (1) a Meta-Semantic Prompt (MSP) pool that learns and consolidates high-level meta-semantics, enabling effective knowledge transfer and adaptation to rare and newly emerging relations; and (2) a learnable fusion token that dynamically combines meta-semantics with task-specific relational information tailored to different few-shot tasks.

      "abstract": "PRefLexOR (Preference-based Recursive Language Modeling for Exploratory Optimization of Reasoning) combines preference optimization with concepts from Reinforcement Learning to enable models to self-teach through iterative reasoning improvements. We propose a recursive learning approach that engages the model in multi-step reasoning, revisiting, and refining intermediate steps before producing a final output in training and inference phases. Through multiple training stages, the model first learns to align its reasoning with accurate decision paths by optimizing the log odds between preferred and non-preferred responses. During this process, PRefLexOR builds a dynamic knowledge graph by generating questions from random text chunks and retrieval-augmentation to contextualize relevant details from the entire training corpus. In the second stage, preference optimization enhances model performance by using rejection sampling to fine-tune reasoning quality by continually producing in-situ training data while masking the reasoning steps. Recursive optimization within a thinking token framework introduces iterative feedback loops, where the model refines reasoning, achieving deeper coherence, consistency, and adaptability. Implemented in small language models with only 3 billion parameters, we should that even tiny models can iteratively teach themselves to reason with greater depth and reflectivity. Our implementation is straightforward and can be incorporated into any existing pretrained LLM. We focus our examples on applications in biological materials science and demonstrate the method in a variety of case studies that range from in-domain to cross-domain applications. Using reasoning strategies that include thinking and reflection modalities we build a multi-agent recursive self-improving inference approach to successively improve responses via repeated sampling in inference time.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) reasoning aims to obtain new knowledge based on existing data. Utilizing large language models (LLMs) through in-context learning for KG reasoning has become a significant direction. However, existing methods mainly extract in-context triples by manually defined standards (such as the neighbors that are directly linked with the query triple), without considering whether they are useful for LLM reasoning. Furthermore, the triples beyond the neighbors can also provide important clues for reasoning. Therefore, it is necessary to extract more useful in-context triples of LLMs for KG reasoning. This paper proposes a rule-and-reinforce in-context triple extraction method to enhance the in-context learning of LLMs for KG reasoning. First, we collect the in-context triples specific to each query triple with the guidance of logical rules, and a neural extractor is pre-trained by the collected triples. Subsequently, the feedback of LLMs is collected as rewards to further optimize the extractor, where the policy gradient is utilized to encourage the extractor to explore more useful triples that yield higher rewards. The experimental results on five different knowledge graphs demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively improve the reasoning performance of LLMs. Compared to the traditional reasoning method AnyBURL, the greatest improvement is 0.147 on Hits@10, FB15k-237.",

      "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graph completion (TKGC) seeks to develop more comprehensive knowledge representations by addressing missing relationships and entities within temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs), thereby enhancing reasoning and predictive capabilities in downstream tasks. Nonetheless, real-world knowledge-such as the progression of social network interactions and the unfolding of news events-is inherently dynamic, resulting in substantial sparsity issues in TKGs that profoundly impair the performance of TKGC models. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Adaptive Neighborhood Enhancement Layer (ANEL), a novel module that can be effortlessly integrated into existing TKGC models to substantially elevate the representation quality of sparse entities. ANEL first derives initial entity embeddings through a base model and then uncovers concealed semantic relationships between entities via a latent relation module, enriching the explicit relationships within the knowledge graph. Furthermore, ANEL incorporates an adaptive latent information adjustment component, which dynamically calibrates the influence of latent information based on the entity's relational structure: entities with fewer connections derive greater benefit from latent information, while entities with denser connections become less dependent on latent augmentation, ensuring precise and resilient representations. We conducted comprehensive experiments on four prominent benchmark datasets, and the results underscore the effectiveness and superiority of ANEL in TKGC tasks.",

      "abstract": "Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) is an extension of traditional Knowledge Graph (KG) that incorporates the dimension of time. Reasoning on TKGs is a crucial task that aims to predict future facts based on historical occurrences. The key challenge lies in uncovering structural dependencies within historical subgraphs and temporal patterns. Most existing approaches model TKGs relying on entity modeling, as nodes in the graph play a crucial role in knowledge representation. However, the real-world scenario often involves an extensive number of entities, with new entities emerging over time. This makes it challenging for entity-dependent methods to cope with extensive volumes of entities, and effectively handling newly emerging entities also becomes a significant challenge. Therefore, we propose Temporal Inductive Path Neural Network (TiPNN), which models historical information in an entity-independent perspective. Specifically, TiPNN adopts a unified graph, namely history temporal graph, to comprehensively capture and encapsulate information from history. Subsequently, we utilize the defined query-aware temporal paths on a history temporal graph to model historical path information related to queries for reasoning. Extensive experiments illustrate that the proposed model not only attains significant performance enhancements but also handles inductive settings, while additionally facilitating the provision of reasoning evidence through history temporal graphs.",

      "abstract": "In a hyper-relational knowledge graph (HKG), each fact is composed of a main triple associated with attribute-value qualifiers, which express additional factual knowledge. The hyper-relational knowledge graph completion (HKGC) task aims at inferring plausible missing links in a HKG. Most existing approaches to HKGC focus on enhancing the communication between qualifier pairs and main triples, while overlooking two important properties that emerge from the monotonicity of the hyper-relational graphs representation regime. Stage Reasoning allows for a two-step reasoning process, facilitating the integration of coarse-grained inference results derived solely from main triples and fine-grained inference results obtained from hyper-relational facts with qualifiers. In the initial stage, coarse-grained results provide an upper bound for correct predictions, which are subsequently refined in the fine-grained step. More generally, Qualifier Monotonicity implies that by attaching more qualifier pairs to a main triple, we may only narrow down the answer set, but never enlarge it. This paper proposes the HyperMono model for hyper-relational knowledge graph completion, which realizes stage reasoning and qualifier monotonicity. To implement qualifier monotonicity HyperMono resorts to cone embeddings. Experiments on three real-world datasets with three different scenario conditions demonstrate the strong performance of HyperMono when compared to the SoTA.",

Hence, we propose a new RL-based approach named EvoPath in this study.

      "abstract": "The multi-granularity temporal knowledge graph question-answering model consists of two core tasks: question information extraction and knowledge graph embedding representation. Existing studies typically compute the relevance score between the question and the associated temporal knowledge graph to identify the answer. However, current multi-granularity temporal knowledge graph datasets are relatively scarce, and most research has not fully exploited the potential of these limited datasets, resulting in limitations in the model’s ability to capture complex temporal relationships. Additionally, existing methods often overlook the model’s ability to capture the rich semantic relationships within questions, especially when dealing with diverse and dynamically changing temporal information. To make full use of the limited datasets and help the model better capture the complex relationships in the question, this paper proposes a multi-granularity temporal knowledge graph question-answering model based on data augmentation and convolutional networks. By using semantic paraphrasing to expand the questions and obtain more comprehensive question representations, and incorporating convolutional networks in the feature learning phase to capture more diverse and richer question representations, the proposed method outperforms baseline models on publicly available datasets, as demonstrated by experimental results.",

      "abstract": "Bone diseases, affecting millions globally, necessitate a nuanced understanding of their underlying causal mechanisms for effective prevention and treatment. Traditional machine learning and deep learning methods, while powerful in identifying patterns and associations, often fall short in distinguishing correlation from causation. This paper addresses this gap by employing the Markov boundary discovery algorithm, a novel causal inference technique, to analyze risk factors associated with bone diseases. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset of patient information, including the occurrence of bone diseases and related factors, we identify the direct causes of bone disease presence, providing a clear and concise depiction of the causal relationships at play. Our results demonstrate a strong alignment with expert opinions, validating the efficacy of our approach and its potential to revolutionize bone disease research. By bridging the gap between data-driven insights and clinical expertise, this study contributes to the enhanced understanding of bone disease etiology, the development of targeted interventions, and the improvement of patient outcomes, marking a significant stride in the field of biomedical research.",

Most of the works on knowledge graph embedding construct negative samples by negative sampling as knowledge graphs typically only contain positive facts. Although substantial progress has been made by dynamic distribution based sampling methods, selecting plausible and prior information-engaged negative samples still poses many challenges. Inspired by type constraint methods, we propose Hierarchical Type Enhanced Negative Sampling (HTENS) which leverages hierarchical entity type information and entity-relation cooccurrence information to optimize the sampling probability distribution of negative samples.

      "abstract": "With the increasing popularity of wireless networks and the development of smart cities, the Mobile Crowdsourcing System (MCS) has emerged as a framework for automatically assigning spatiotemporal tasks to workers. The study of mobile crowdsourcing makes a valuable research contribution to community service and urban route planning. However, previous algorithms have faced challenges in effectively addressing task allocation issues with massive spatial data. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to the spatiotemporal task allocation problem using a knowledge graph. Firstly, we construct a robust spatiotemporal knowledge graph (STKG) and employ a knowledge graph embedding algorithm to learn the representations of nodes and edges. Next, we utilize these representations to build a task transition graph, which is a weighted and learning-based graph that highlights important neighbors for each task. We then apply a simplified Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and an RNN-based model to enhance task representations and capture sequential transition patterns on the task transition graph. Furthermore, we design a similarity function to facilitate personalized task allocation. Through experimental results, we demonstrate that our solution achieves higher accuracy compared to existing approaches when tested on three real datasets. These research findings are significant as they contribute to an 18.01% improvement in spatiotemporal task allocation accuracy.",

Structure-Information-based reasoning over the KG is a technique used to find the missing facts by the structure information of KG. This survey summarizes the methods and applications of Structure-Information-based reasoning and hopes to be helpful to the research in this field. First, we introduced the definition of knowledge reasoning and the conceptual description of related tasks. Then, we reviewed the methods of Structure-Information-based reasoning. Specifically, we categorized them into four representative classes: PRA-based reasoning, Path-Embedding-based reasoning, RL-based reasoning, and GNN-based reasoning. We compared the motivations and details between practices in the same category. After that, we described the application of Structure-Information-based knowledge reasoning in the KG Completion, Question Answering System, Recommendation System, and other fields.

The vector representation increases the precision of link prediction and the efficiency of downstream tasks. However, these methods cannot process previously unseen entities during the knowledge graph evolution. In other words, the model trained on the source knowledge graph cannot be applied to the target knowledge graph containing new unseen entities. Recently, a few subgraph-based link prediction models obtained the inductive ability, but they all neglect semantic information. In this work, we propose an inductive representation learning model TGraiL which considers not only the topological structure but also semantic information. First, distance in the subgraph is used to encode the node’s topological structure. Second, the projection matrix is used to encode the entity type information. Finally, both kinds of information are fused for training to acquire the ultimate vector representation of entities. The experimental results indicate that the model’s performance has been significantly improved compared to the existing baseline models, demonstrating the method’s effectiveness and superiority.",

      "abstract": "Over the past two decades, recommendation systems (RSs) have used machine learning (ML) solutions to recommend items, e.g., movies, books, and restaurants, to clients of a business or an online platform. Recipe recommendation, however, has not yet received much attention compared to those applications. We introduce RECipe as a multi-purpose recipe recommendation framework with a multi-modal knowledge graph (MMKG) backbone. The motivation behind RECipe is to go beyond (deep) neural collaborative filtering (NCF) by recommending recipes to users when they query in natural language or by providing an image. RECipe consists of 3 subsystems: (1) behavior-based recommender, (2) review-based recommender, and (3) image-based recommender. Each subsystem relies on the embedding representations of entities and relations in the graph. We first obtain (pre-trained) embedding representations of textual entities, such as reviews or ingredients, from a fine-tuned model of Microsoft's MPNet. We initialize the weights of the entities with these embeddings to train our knowledge graph embedding (KGE) model. For the visual component, i.e., recipe images, we develop a KGE-Guided variational autoencoder (KG-VAE) to learn the distribution of images and their latent representations. Once KGE and KG-VAE models are fully trained, we use them as a multi-purpose recommendation framework. For benchmarking, we created two knowledge graphs (KGs) from public datasets on Kaggle for recipe recommendation. Our experiments show that the KGE models have comparable performance to the neural solutions. We also present pre-trained NLP embeddings to address important applications such as zero-shot inference for new users (or the cold start problem) and conditional recommendation with respect to recipe categories. We eventually demonstrate the application of RECipe in a multi-purpose recommendation setting.",

      "abstract": "Reliability in steel production lines is critical for maintaining operational efficiency, ensuring product quality, and minimizing downtime. The potential failure of any equipment can negatively impact the reliability of steel production lines. Therefore, it is urgent to establish an efficient system for fault diagnosis (FD). We introduce a novel FD model called triple agent-based reinforcement learning (TARL), which comprises the fact extraction (FE) agent, the relation selection (RS) agent, and the entity selection (ES) agent. A top–down construction method is first employed to build a steel production line fault knowledge graph (SteelFaultKG). During the fault reasoning process, the RS agent and ES agent collaborate to identify the correct reasoning path on the SteelFaultKG. However, the initial SteelFaultKG is sparse and incomplete, hindering the RS and ES agents from inferring the correct reasoning path. To mitigate this limitation, the FE agent is introduced to dynamically enrich the SteelFaultKG by generating fact triples from an external corpus. This expansion of action space in SteelFaultKG is instrumental in enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities. Comprehensive experimental results on a steel production line fault-related dataset indicate that the TARL model significantly enhances FD accuracy. This advancement in FD, offered by the TARL model, significantly enhances the operational reliability of steel production lines.",

However, existing embedding models fall short in effectively utilizing data from diverse knowledge domains within the context of multiple cross-domain knowledge graphs while ensuring the privacy of exchanged data. How to achieve cross-domain knowledge embedding in the integration and sharing of knowledge information is an urgent problem to be solved. To challenge this problem, a Cross-Domain Privacy-Preserving Knowledge Graph Embedding (CDPPKGE) algorithm is described to achieve trusted sharing of knowledge information. In the algorithm, the federated learning idea is introduced to realize cross-domain privacy information exchange of Knowledge graph. Specifically, the information exchange between Knowledge graphs involves two stages: Firstly, the RSA encryption mechanism is adopted to achieve trusted transmission of private data during the alignment process of graph entities. Secondly, differential privacy method is adopted to protect the trusted transmission of private data in the process of cross-domain embedding alignment. And then experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves better graph embedding quality while preserving the privacy of sensitive data.",

      "abstract": "Sarcasm thrives on popular social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit, where users frequently employ it to convey emotions in an ironic or satirical manner. The ability to detect sarcasm plays a pivotal role in comprehending individuals’ true sentiments. To achieve a comprehensive grasp of sentence semantics, it is crucial to integrate external knowledge that can aid in deciphering entities and their intricate relationships within a sentence. Although some efforts have been made in this regard, their use of external knowledge is still relatively superficial. Specifically, Knowledge-enhanced entity and relationship understanding still face significant challenges. In this paper, we propose the Knowledge Enhanced Sentiment Dependency Graph Convolutional Network (KSDGCN) framework, which constructs a commonsense-augmented sentiment graph and a commonsense-replaced dependency graph for each text to explicitly capture the role of external knowledge for sarcasm detection. Furthermore, we validate the irrational relationships between co-occurring entity pairs within sentences and background knowledge by a signed attention mechanism. We conduct experiments on four benchmark datasets, and the results show that KSDGCN outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and is highly interpretable.",

      "abstract": "Matching similar pairs of trajectories, called trajectory similarity join, is a fundamental functionality for the Internet of Everything (IoE). We obverse that keyword-augmented trajectories are becoming increasingly popular. In this light, we investigate semantic trajectory similarity (STS) join that consists of two subproblems, threshold-based STS Join and top-k STS (k-STS) Join. Each semantic trajectory is a sequence of geo-textual objects with both location and text information. Specifically, given two sets of semantic trajectories and a threshold $\\theta $ or result number k, the STS Join returns all pairs of semantic trajectories from the two sets with spatio-textual similarity no less than $\\theta $ , and the k-STS Join returns k most similar pairs of semantic trajectories from the two sets. To enable efficient STS and k-STS Joins processing on large sets of semantic trajectories, we present a two-phase parallel search algorithm. We first group semantic trajectories based on their text information. The algorithm’s per-group searches are independent of each other and thus can be performed in parallel. We generate spatial and textual summaries for each trajectory batch and develop batch filtering techniques to prune unqualified trajectory pairs in a batch mode. Next, we propose a divide-and-conquer algorithm to derive bounds of spatial similarity and textual similarity between two semantic trajectories, which enable us filter out dissimilar trajectory pairs efficiently. Further, hierarchical batch filtering join algorithm is developed to process k-STS Join. Experimental study with large semantic trajectory data confirms that our algorithm of processing semantic trajectory join is capable of substantially outperforming well-designed baselines.",

Conventional AI systems face challenges in applying affordance, as it represents implicit knowledge derived from common sense. However, large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities due to their ability to process extensive human knowledge. This study proposes a method for automatic affordance acquisition by leveraging LLM outputs. The process involves generating text using LLMs, reconstructing the output into a symbol network using morphological and dependency analysis, and calculating affordances based on network distances. Experiments using ``apple'' as an example demonstrated the method's ability to extract context-dependent affordances with high explainability. The results suggest that the proposed symbol network, reconstructed from LLM outputs, enables robots to interpret affordances effectively, bridging the gap between symbolized data and human-like situational understanding.",

      "abstract": "The 534 protein kinases encoded in the human genome constitute a large druggable class of proteins that include both well-studied and understudied “dark” members. Accurate prediction of dark kinase functions is a major bioinformatics challenge. Here, we employ a graph mining approach that uses the evolutionary and functional context encoded in knowledge graphs (KGs) to predict protein and pathway associations for understudied kinases. We propose a new scalable graph embedding approach, RegPattern2Vec, which employs regular pattern constrained random walks to sample diverse aspects of node context within a KG flexibly. RegPattern2Vec learns functional representations of kinases, interacting partners, post-translational modifications, pathways, cellular localization, and chemical interactions from a kinase-centric KG that integrates and conceptualizes data from curated heterogeneous data resources. By contextualizing information relevant to prediction, RegPattern2Vec improves accuracy and efficiency in comparison to other random walk-based graph embedding approaches. We show that the predictions produced by our model overlap with pathway enrichment data produced using experimentally validated Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) data from both publicly available databases and experimental datasets not used in training. Our model also has the advantage of using the collected random walks as biological context to interpret the predicted protein-pathway associations. We provide high-confidence pathway predictions for 34 dark kinases and present three case studies in which analysis of meta-paths associated with the prediction enables biological interpretation. Overall, RegPattern2Vec efficiently samples multiple node types for link prediction on biological knowledge graphs and the predicted associations between understudied kinases, pseudokinases, and known pathways serve as a conceptual starting point for hypothesis generation and testing.",

      "abstract": "Over the years, reasoning over knowledge graphs (KGs), which aims to infer new conclusions from known facts, has mostly focused on static KGs. The unceasing growth of knowledge in real life raises the necessity to enable the inductive reasoning ability on expanding KGs. Existing inductive work assumes that new entities all emerge once in a batch, which oversimplifies the real scenario that new entities continually appear. This study dives into a more realistic and challenging setting where new entities emerge in multiple batches. We propose a walk-based inductive reasoning model to tackle the new setting. Specifically, a graph convolutional network with adaptive relation aggregation is designed to encode and update entities using their neighboring relations. To capture the varying neighbor importance, we employ a query-aware feedback attention mechanism during the aggregation. Furthermore, to alleviate the sparse link problem of new entities, we propose a link augmentation strategy to add trustworthy facts into KGs. We construct three new datasets for simulating this multi-batch emergence scenario. The experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art embedding-based, walk-based and rule-based models on inductive KG reasoning.",

In this work, we examine the contribution of geometrical space to the task of knowledge base completion. We focus on the family of translational models, whose performance has been lagging.

We investigate the type of regularities that our model, dubbed HyperKG, can capture and show that it is a prominent candidate for effectively representing a subset of Datalog rules. We empirically show, using a variety of link prediction datasets, that hyperbolic space allows to narrow down significantly the performance gap between translational and bilinear models and effectively represent certain types of rules.

      "title": "Unlearning of Knowledge Graph Embedding via Preference Optimization",
      "abstract": "Existing knowledge graphs (KGs) inevitably contain outdated or erroneous knowledge that needs to be removed from knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models. To address this challenge, knowledge unlearning can be applied to eliminate specific information while preserving the integrity of the remaining knowledge in KGs. Existing unlearning methods can generally be categorized into exact unlearning and approximate unlearning. However, exact unlearning requires high training costs while approximate unlearning faces two issues when applied to KGs due to the inherent connectivity of triples: (1) It fails to fully remove targeted information, as forgetting triples can still be inferred from remaining ones. (2) It focuses on local data for specific removal, which weakens the remaining knowledge in the forgetting boundary. To address these issues, we propose GraphDPO, a novel approximate unlearning framework based on direct preference optimization (DPO). Firstly, to effectively remove forgetting triples, we reframe unlearning as a preference optimization problem, where the model is trained by DPO to prefer reconstructed alternatives over the original forgetting triples. This formulation penalizes reliance on forgettable knowledge, mitigating incomplete forgetting caused by KG connectivity. Moreover, we introduce an out-boundary sampling strategy to construct preference pairs with minimal semantic overlap, weakening the connection between forgetting and retained knowledge. Secondly, to preserve boundary knowledge, we introduce a boundary recall mechanism that replays and distills relevant information both within and across time steps. We construct eight unlearning datasets across four popular KGs with varying unlearning rates. Experiments show that GraphDPO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 10.1% in MRR_Avg and 14.0% in MRR_F1.",

      "abstract": "Zero-shot Learning (ZSL), which aims to predict for those classes that have never appeared in the training data, has arisen hot research interests. The key of implementing ZSL is to leverage the prior knowledge of classes which builds the semantic relationship between classes and enables the transfer of the learned models (e.g., features) from training classes (i.e., seen classes) to unseen classes. However, the priors adopted by the existing methods are relatively limited with incomplete semantics. In this paper, we explore richer and more competitive prior knowledge to model the inter-class relationship for ZSL via ontology-based knowledge representation and semantic embedding. Meanwhile, to address the data imbalance between seen classes and unseen classes, we developed a generative ZSL framework with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Our main findings include: (i) an ontology-enhanced ZSL framework that can be applied to different domains, such as image classification (IMGC) and knowledge graph completion (KGC); (ii) a comprehensive evaluation with multiple zero-shot datasets from different domains, where our method often achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art models. In particular, on four representative ZSL baselines of IMGC, the ontology-based class semantics outperform the previous priors e.g., the word embeddings of classes by an average of 12.4 accuracy points in the standard ZSL across two example datasets (see Figure 4).",

In this work, we propose a symbolic learning-free approach using fuzzy logic to address the shape-closure problem that restricted geometric-based embedding models to only a few shapes (e.g. ConE) for answering complex logical queries. The use of symbolic approach facilitates non-closure geometric models (e.g. point, box) to handle logical operators (including negation). This enabled our newly proposed spherical embeddings (SpherE) in this work to use a polar coordinate system to effectively represent hierarchical relation.

We show that SpherE significantly outperforms the point and box embeddings approaches while generating semantically meaningful hierarchy-aware embeddings.",

      "abstract": "Currently, there are various types of cybersecurity intelligence databases on the Internet, but the security vulnerability information in each database is relatively dispersed, making it difficult to form a comprehensive security protection perspective. Constructing a cybersecurity knowledge graph can effectively integrate the data in various information security databases and respond to potential security risks more intuitively. In this thesis, data from the CAPEC and CWE cybersecurity repositories are used as data sources. Aiming at the problem of Bernoulli negative sampling not generating high-quality negative samples, this paper proposes an improved method based on the combination of GMM and SVM. The method first uses the Gaussian clustering algorithm (GMM) to perform preliminary clustering of entities to gather similar entities together and then further refines the classification by support vector machine (SVM) to generate high-quality negative samples that are more indistinguishable from the original entities. After generating high-quality negative samples, the training of the model may face more challenges; we add a binary classification neural network as a classifier in the loss function to help the model improve the discriminative ability of positive and negative samples and introduce Facolloss into the classifier to improve the classifier’s ability to distinguish between positive and negative samples. The experimental results show that applying the negative sampling method proposed in this paper to the knowledge inference model outperforms other negative sampling algorithms.",

This article analyzes the most common damages and presents the results of modeling an electrical system with transformer coupling, where all types of asymmetric short circuits were initiated. The dynamics of changes in the symmetrical components of short-circuit currents of the forward, reverse, and zero sequences are determined.

      "abstract": "Recently, ontology embeddings representing entities in a low-dimensional space have been proposed for ontology completion. However, the ontology embeddings for concept subsumption prediction do not address the difficulties of similar and isolated entities and fail to extract the global information of annotation axioms from an ontology. In this paper, we propose a self-matching training method for the two ontology embedding models: Inverted-index Matrix Embedding (InME) and Co-occurrence Matrix Embedding (CoME). The two embeddings capture the global and local information in annotation axioms by means of the occurring locations of each word in a set of axioms and the co-occurrences of words in each axiom. The self-matching training method increases the robustness of the concept subsumption prediction when predicted superclasses are similar to subclasses and are isolated to other entities in an ontology. Our evaluation experiments show that the self-matching training method with InME outperforms the existing ontology embeddings for the GO and FoodOn ontologies and that the method with the concatenation of CoME and OWL2Vec* outperforms them for the HeLiS ontology.",

Then, we explain how this deficiency can be addressed through a transition from the word level to the more fine-grained level of word senses (in its broader acceptation) as a method for modelling unambiguous lexical meaning. We present a comprehensive overview of the wide range of techniques in the two main branches of sense representation, i.e., unsupervised and knowledge-based. Finally, this survey covers the main evaluation procedures and applications for this type of representation, and provides an analysis of four of its important aspects: interpretability, sense granularity, adaptability to different domains and compositionality. \n \n \n",

      "abstract": "Recommender systems are one of the most successful applications of using AI for providing personalized e-services to customers. However, data sparsity is presenting enormous challenges that are hindering the further development of advanced recommender systems. Although cross-domain recommendation partly overcomes data sparsity by transferring knowledge from a source domain with relatively dense data to augment data in the target domain, the current methods do not handle heterogeneous data very well. For example, using today’s cross-domain transfer learning schemes with data comprising clicks, ratings, user reviews, item metadata, and knowledge graphs will likely result in a poorly performing model. User preferences will not be comprehensively profiled, and accurate recommendations will not be generated. To solve these three challenges—handling heterogeneous data, avoiding negative transfer, and dealing with data sparsity—we designed a new end-to-end deep Adversarial Multi-channel Transfer network for Cross-Domain Recommendation named AMT-CDR. Heterogeneous data is handled by constructing a cross-domain graph based on real-world knowledge graphs—we used Freebase and YAGO. Negative transfer is prevented through an adversarial learning strategy that maintains consistency across the different data channels. Data sparsity is addressed with an end-to-end neural network that considers data across multiple channels and generates accurate recommendations by leveraging knowledge from both the source and target domains. Extensive experiments on three dual-target cross-domain recommendation tasks demonstrate the superiority of AMT-CDR compared to eight state-of-the-art methods.

      "abstract": "Compared with deterministic knowledge graphs, uncertain knowledge graphs can better describe the inherent uncertainty of relations facts in the real world. However, existing embedding models for uncertain knowledge graphs can not capture the direct effect of the confidence score on information propagation between different entities across different relations. This paper proposes a confidence-aware knowledge graph embedding model based on graph convolutional networks (CA-GCN). It enables the propagation of confidence information within the graph structure, allowing confidence scores to directly influence message passing, and ultimately improves the performance of unseen relation facts confidence prediction. To mitigate the adverse effects of false-negative samples during training, we design a collaborative mechanism between a confidence generator and a relation discriminator. The relation discriminator is used to determine if a given triplet is valid, and the confidence generator is used to generate confidence scores. In this way, confidence information of positive and negative samples can play unique roles in different encoders at different stages to avoid the influence of false negatives. Experiments on three widely used datasets show promising results with an obvious performance improvement compared to existing uncertain knowledge embedding models.",

We approach in this paper the task of Temporal Validity Reassessment, inspired by traditional natural language reasoning to determine the updates of the temporal validity of text content. The task requires judgment whether actions expressed in a sentence are still ongoing or rather completed, hence, whether the sentence still remains valid or has become obsolete, given the presence of context in the form of a supplementary content such as a follow-up sentence. We first construct our own dataset for this task and train several machine learning models. Then we propose an effective method for learning information from an external knowledge base that gives information regarding temporal commonsense knowledge. Using our prepared dataset, we introduce a machine learning model that incorporates the information from the knowledge base and demonstrate that incorporating external knowledge generally improves the results. We also experiment with different embedding types to represent temporal commonsense knowledge as well as with data augmentation methods to increase the size of our dataset.",

The rapid decline of China’s P2P platform market highlights the urgent need for Internet financial institutions to enhance their credit risk management strategies. Previous studies have applied machine learning to assess credit risk; however, their effectiveness is often hampered by a lack of consideration for semantic information and individual correlation. In response, we propose an innovative approach, KG-GNN, which integrates knowledge graph (KG) and graph neural network (GNN). KG-GNN leverages KG to encapsulate semantic information within complex categorical features and explore potential relationships between borrowers. Utilizing GNN, our framework extracts representation features from the KG to build comprehensive and accurate credit risk models. Our findings indicate that KG-GNN not only can predict credit risk more accurately than conventional machine learning models but also improves the stream model performance by over 20% through KG and GNN-based data augmentation techniques. By integrating KG with GNN, our approach enriches the methodologies for credit risk management and can be adapted to other data mining challenges that require processing complex semantic and relational information, thereby enhancing model learning capabilities.",

      "abstract": "Negative sampling is an essential part in knowledge graph embedding, which offers significant advantages to numerous downstream related tasks. There are two kinds of important negatives: hard and false negatives. Hard negatives are the negatives which are difficult to distinguish from positive samples, while false negatives are positive samples which are mistakenly identified as negatives. Harnessing hard negatives effectively can make the model more discriminative, and reducing false negatives can avoid misleading the model during training. Therefore, the two kinds of negatives are essential in high-quality negative sampling. However, the present negative sampling methods face two shortcomings: 1.judging one negative is hard or false mainly relies on score functions; 2. difficulty in balancing the impact of hard and false negatives. In this paper, we absorb bigram language model and propose a novel criterion to help verify the negatives are hard or false, and discuss how to keep the balance between hard and false negatives. Experiments on four representative score functions and two public datasets demonstrate the effects of the proposed negative sampling method.",

      "abstract": "Link prediction is an important task in addressing the incompleteness problem of knowledge graphs (KG). Previous link prediction models suffer from issues related to either performance or explanatory capability. Furthermore, models that are capable of generating explanations, often struggle with erroneous paths or reasoning leading to the correct answer. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Neural-Symbolic model named FaSt-FLiP (stands for Fast and Slow Thinking with Filtered rules for Link Prediction task), inspired by two distinct aspects of human cognition:\"commonsense reasoning\"and\"thinking, fast and slow.\"Our objective is to combine a logical and neural model for enhanced link prediction. To tackle the challenge of dealing with incorrect paths or rules generated by the logical model, we propose a semi-supervised method to convert rules into sentences. These sentences are then subjected to assessment and removal of incorrect rules using an NLI (Natural Language Inference) model. Our approach to combining logical and neural models involves first obtaining answers from both the logical and neural models. These answers are subsequently unified using an Inference Engine module, which has been realized through both algorithmic implementation and a novel neural model architecture. To validate the efficacy of our model, we conducted a series of experiments. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our model in both link prediction metrics and the generation of more reliable explanations.",

      "abstract": "Few-shot knowledge graph complementation (FKGC) has gained broad interest, where each task aims to complete missing facts of the long tail relations by few-shot support instances in the knowledge graph (KG). Most previous FKGC models encode few-shot relations by aggregating the neighbor information of each entity but do not make fine-grained distinctions between neighbor relations and entities. Moreover, many of those models neglect the valuable information interaction between relations, which may reduce the representational performance of the model. In this paper, we propose HARV, a novel FKGC framework based on hierarchical attention encoder and relation recoding validator. Specifically, through the hierarchical attention encoder, we can aggregate fine-grained information at the relation-level and entity-level in the neighbors respectively, thus obtaining more accurate representations. Besides, through the relation recoding validator, we are able to capture the interaction between different relations, which can decrease the over-dependence on specific entities in the few-shot relation encoding stage. Experimental results on two datasets, NELL and Wiki, demonstrate that our model performs better than the state-of-the-art baselines in different few-shot sizes. We also demonstrate the interpretability of our approach through a case study of different levels of attention for heterogeneous neighbors when encoding the central entity in the experiment.",

      "abstract": "Link prediction (LP) is crucial for Knowledge Graphs (KG) completion but commonly suffers from interpretability issues. While several methods have been proposed to explain embedding-based LP models, they are generally limited to local explanations on KG and are deficient in providing human interpretable semantics. Based on real-world observations of the characteristics of KGs from multiple domains, we propose to explain LP models in KG with path-based explanations. An integrated framework, namely eXpath, is introduced which incorporates the concept of relation path with ontological closed path rules to enhance both the efficiency and effectiveness of LP interpretation. Notably, the eXpath explanations can be fused with other single-link explanation approaches to achieve a better overall solution. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets and LP models demonstrate that introducing eXpath can boost the quality of resulting explanations by about 20% on two key metrics and reduce the required explanation time by 61.4%, in comparison to the best existing method. Case studies further highlight eXpath's ability to provide more semantically meaningful explanations through path-based evidence.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) furnish large language models (LLMs) with iterative retrievals of relevant information to handle complex multi-hop questions. These methods typically alternate between LLM reasoning and retrieval to accumulate external information into the LLM's context. However, the ever-growing context inherently imposes an increasing burden on the LLM to perceive connections among critical information pieces, with futile reasoning steps further exacerbating this overload issue. In this paper, we present KnowTrace, an elegant RAG framework to (1) mitigate the context overload and (2) bootstrap higher-quality multi-step reasoning. Instead of simply piling the retrieved contents, KnowTrace autonomously traces out desired knowledge triplets to organize a specific knowledge graph relevant to the input question. Such a structured workflow not only empowers the LLM with an intelligible context for inference, but also naturally inspires a reflective mechanism of knowledge backtracing to identify contributive LLM generations as process supervision data for self-bootstrapping. Extensive experiments show that KnowTrace consistently surpasses existing methods across three multi-hop question answering benchmarks, and the bootstrapped version further amplifies the gains.",

      "abstract": "Considering the complexity of entity pair relations and the information contained in the target neighborhood in few-shot knowledge graphs (KG), existing few-shot KG completion methods generally suffer from insufficient relation representation learning capabilities and neglecting the contextual semantics of entities. To tackle the above problems, we propose a Few-shot Relation Learning-based Knowledge Graph Completion model (FRL-KGC). First, a gating mechanism is introduced during the aggregation of higher-order neighborhoods of entities in formation, enriching the central entity representation while reducing the adverse effects of noisy neighbors. Second, during the relation representation learning stage, a more accurate relation representation is learned by using the correlation between entity pairs in the reference set. Finally, an LSTM structure is incorporated into the Transformer learner to enhance its ability to learn the contextual semantics of entities and relations and predict new factual knowledge. We conducted comparative experiments on the publicly available NELL-One and Wiki-One datasets, comparing FRL-KGC with six few-shot knowledge graph completion models and five traditional knowledge graph completion models for five-shot link prediction. The results showed that FRL-KGC outperformed all comparison models in terms of MRR, Hits@10, Hits@5, and Hits@1 metrics.",

      "abstract": "Drug repositioning is a faster and more affordable solution than traditional drug discovery approaches. From this perspective, computational drug repositioning using knowledge graphs is a very promising direction. Knowledge graphs constructed from drug data and information can be used to generate hypotheses (molecule/drug - target links) through link prediction using machine learning algorithms. However, it remains rare to have a holistically constructed knowledge graph using the broadest possible features and drug characteristics, which is freely available to the community. The OREGANO knowledge graph aims at filling this gap. The purpose of this paper is to present the OREGANO knowledge graph, which includes natural compounds related data. The graph was developed from scratch by retrieving data directly from the knowledge sources to be integrated. We therefore designed the expected graph model and proposed a method for merging nodes between the different knowledge sources, and finally, the data were cleaned. The knowledge graph, as well as the source codes for the ETL process, are openly available on the GitHub of the OREGANO project ( https://gitub.u-bordeaux.fr/erias/oregano ).",

      "abstract": "Learning graph embeddings is a crucial task in graph mining tasks. An effective graph embedding model can learn low-dimensional representations from graph-structured data for data publishing benefiting various downstream applications such as node classification, link prediction, etc. However, recent studies have revealed that graph embeddings are susceptible to attribute inference attacks, which allow attackers to infer private node attributes from the learned graph embeddings. To address these concerns, privacy-preserving graph embedding methods have emerged, aiming to simultaneously consider primary learning and privacy protection through adversarial learning. However, most existing methods assume that representation models have access to all sensitive attributes in advance during the training stage, which is not always the case due to diverse privacy preferences. Furthermore, the commonly used adversarial learning technique in privacy-preserving representation learning suffers from unstable training issues. In this paper, we propose a novel approach calledPrivate Variational Graph AutoEncoders (PVGAE) with the aid of independent distribution penalty as a regularization term. Specifically, we split the original variational graph autoencoder (VGAE) to learn sensitive and non-sensitive latent representations using two sets of encoders. Additionally, we introduce a novel regularization to enforce the independence of the encoders. We prove the theoretical effectiveness of regularization from the perspective of mutual information. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that PVGAE outperforms other baselines in private embedding learning regarding utility performance and privacy protection.",

      "abstract": "Dialogue relation extraction (DRE) aims to extract relations between two arguments within a dialogue, which is more challenging than standard RE due to the higher person pronoun frequency and lower information density in dialogues. However, existing DRE methods still suffer from two serious issues: (1) hard to capture long and sparse multi-turn information, and (2) struggle to extract golden relations based on partial dialogues, which motivates us to discover more effective methods that can alleviate the above issues. We notice that the rise of large language models (LLMs) has sparked considerable interest in evaluating their performance across diverse tasks. To this end, we initially investigate the capabilities of different LLMs in DRE, considering both proprietary models and open-source models. Interestingly, we discover that LLMs significantly alleviate two issues in existing DRE methods. Generally, we have following findings: (1) scaling up model size substantially boosts the overall DRE performance and achieves exceptional results, tackling the difficulty of capturing long and sparse multi-turn information; (2) LLMs encounter with much smaller performance drop from entire dialogue setting to partial dialogue setting compared to existing methods; (3) LLMs deliver competitive or superior performances under both full-shot and few-shot settings compared to current state-of-the-art; (4) LLMs show modest performances on inverse relations but much stronger improvements on general relations, and they can handle dialogues of various lengths especially for longer sequences.",

      "abstract": "Real-world recommendation scenarios usually need to handle diverse user-item interaction behaviours, including page views, adding items into carts, and purchasing activities. The interactions that precede the actual target behaviour (e.g., purchasing an item) allow to capture the user’s preferences from different angles, and are used as auxiliary information (e.g., page views) to enrich the system’s knowledge about the users’ preferences, thereby helping to enhance recommendation for the target behaviour. Despite efforts in modelling the users’ multi-behaviour interaction information, the existing multi-behaviour recommenders still face two challenges: (1) Data sparsity across multiple user behaviours is a common issue that limits the recommendation performance, particularly for the target behaviour, which typically exhibits fewer interactions compared to other auxiliary behaviours; (2) Noisy auxiliary interactive behaviours where the information in the auxiliary behaviours might be non-relevant for recommendation. In this case, a direct adoption of contrastive learning between the target behaviour and the auxiliary behaviours will amplify the noise in the auxiliary behaviours, thereby negatively impacting the real semantics that can be derived from the target behaviour. To address these two challenges, we propose a new model called Knowledge-Enhanced Multi-behaviour Contrastive Learning for Recommendation (KEMCL). In particular, to address the problem of sparse user multi-behaviour interaction information, we leverage a dual-perspective knowledge encoding componentthat enriches the semantic representations of items, and generate supervision signals through self-supervised learning so as to enhance recommendation. In addition, we develop a cross-behaviour learning component, which includes two contrastive learning (CL) methods, inter CL and intra CL, to alleviate the problem of noisy auxiliary interactions. Extensive experiments on three public recommendation datasets show that our proposed KEMCL model significantly outperforms seven existing state-of-the-art methods. In particular, our KEMCL model outperforms the best baseline, namely KMCLR, by 5.42% on the large Tmall dataset.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) plays a dominant role in the study of Knowledge Graph (KG). Although KGE has received special concern in recent years, it is still in its infancy and many reported publications have some obvious drawbacks. For instance, the scoring function is usually defined in a rough way, inevitably degrading the precision of the entity embedding. Besides, negative sampling in KGE is somewhat conservative since it has not taken the data distribution into account. To address these issues, in this paper, a novel KGE via Delicate Negative Sampling and Efficient Biased Learning (DNS-EBL) is put forward. The proposed DNS-EBL has the following three obvious advantages: 1) concerning the limited capacity of extracting the latent relation between entities, the bias is introduced to the scoring function, thereby enlarging the solution space to improve the quality of embedding; 2) Gaussian noises with the known distribution are injected into KGE to make good use of the statistical character of data and reduce the risk of overfitting; and 3) a dynamic clustering method is adopted to establish inter- and intra- clusters for entities so that negative samples with high-quality can be selected during embedding. Finally, experimental results on three datasets: FB15k, WN18 and WN18RR demonstrate the superiority of DNS-EBL in accomplishing the KG Completion task over some state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively adopted in Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), showcasing significant research advancements. However, as black-box models driven by deep neural architectures, current LLM-based KGC methods rely on implicit knowledge representation with parallel propagation of erroneous knowledge, thereby hindering their ability to produce conclusive and decisive reasoning outcomes. We aim to integrate neural-perceptual structural information with ontological knowledge, leveraging the powerful capabilities of LLMs to achieve a deeper understanding of the intrinsic logic of the knowledge. We propose an ontology enhanced KGC method using LLMs -- OL-KGC. It first leverages neural perceptual mechanisms to effectively embed structural information into the textual space, and then uses an automated extraction algorithm to retrieve ontological knowledge from the knowledge graphs (KGs) that needs to be completed, which is further transformed into a textual format comprehensible to LLMs for providing logic guidance. We conducted extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmarks -- FB15K-237, UMLS and WN18RR. The experimental results demonstrate that OL-KGC significantly outperforms existing mainstream KGC methods across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance.",

They provide to users personalized recommendations and explanations about these recommendations. Embedding-based models, despite their widespread use, often suffer from a lack of interpretability, which can undermine trust and user engagement. This paper presents an approach that combines embedding-based and semantic-based models to generate post-hoc explanations in recommender systems, leveraging ontology-based knowledge graphs to improve interpretability and explainability. By organizing data within a structured framework, ontologies enable the modeling of intricate relationships between entities, which is essential for generating explanations.

      "abstract": "CircRNA has been found to exhibit with human diseases, rendering the investigation of the circRNA-disease association (CDA) of significant importance. Deep learning provides a novel avenue for predicting CDA, however, due to the limited availability of comprehensive CDA datasets, most existing methods operate by directly reasoning over triplets of embedded entities and relations, neglecting the explicit capture local depth information. In this study, we propose a novel approach called Knowledge Graph-Enhanced Recursive Aggregation for CDA (KGRACDA), which enables the querying of explicit local structures surrounding triplets, thereby serving as crucial evidence for predicting CDA. First, we construct a comprehensive CDA knowledge graph utilizing a large-scale, multi-source heterogeneous dataset. Subsequently, we develop a graph neural network using recursive techniques and employ attention aggregation to generate CDA prediction scores. Experimental results demonstrate that KGRACDA surpasses other state-of-the-art methods by explicitly capturing local depth information related to CDA. To improve the convenience of CDA prediction, we have updated an interactive web platform named HNRBase v2.0, which provides rich visualization of circRNA data, and allows users to easily download data and predict CDA using KGRACDA. The code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/maoyuanma/KGRACDA.",

      "abstract": "The ability to rapidly adapt to unseen scenarios for safe driving has long been a core challenge in autonomous driving. Rule-based methods are heavily reliant on labeled data and suffer from data biases. Many current reinforcement learning(RL)-based methods, on the other hand, are restricted to certain training scenarios, making it difficult for them to adapt to more complex and diverse traffic scenarios. In contrast, human drivers can quickly adapt to new driving situations based on their accumulated driving skills. Inspired by this, we propose the Vehicle Skill Graph (VSG), a novel framework for autonomous driving decision-making. By accumulating 1,000 diverse skills using RL and adopting knowledge graph embedding (KGE) techniques, we build a skill graph that offers a structured understanding of driving knowledge and discovers the potential relations between driving skills and new traffic scenarios. This enables rapid adaptation to new driving environments and addresses the issue of training scenario dependency in RL learning-based approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that VSG effectively captures the latent connections between traffic scenes and driving skills, facilitating efficient sequential decision-making in complex driving situations.",

However, in real-world scenarios, Knowledge Graphs (KG) evolve fast with out-of-knowledge-graph (OOKG) entities added frequently, and we need to efficiently represent these entities. Most existing Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) methods cannot represent OOKG entities without costly retraining on the whole KG. To enhance efficiency, we propose a simple and effective method that inductively represents OOKG entities by their optimal estimation under translational assumptions. Moreover, given pretrained embeddings of the in-knowledge-graph (IKG) entities, our method even needs no additional learning. Experimental results on two KGC tasks with OOKG entities show that our method outperforms the previous methods by a large margin with higher efficiency.",

Notably, discerning patterns concerning the compatibility of acupoints emerges as a promising avenue to enhance therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of various ailments. However, sparse acupuncture data tend to pose significant challenge on existing methodologies. In response to this challenge, we propose an enhanced graph infomax model combined with Convolutional Knowledge-base (EGICK). EGICK leverages the Deep Graph Infomax (DGI) embedding model to derive embeddings for entities and relations, thereby facilitating enhanced interactions between these elements. Concurrently, it harnesses the advantages of contrastive learning to mitigate the adverse effects of data sparsity. Specifically, our model exhibits the capacity to comprehensively acquire acupoint compatibility rules by amalgamating both structural and semantic information pertaining to entities and their relations. Subsequently, we construct an acupuncture knowledge graph to verify the effectiveness of the model, utilizing a corpus of acupuncture literature. Furthermore, Empirical experimentation demonstrates the superior performance of EGICK comparison to other models, as substantiated across publicly available datasets.",

      "abstract": "To address the problem of data sparsity in recommendation systems, various studies have used knowledge graphs as auxiliary information. These studies have employed multitask learning (MTL) to enhance recommendation performance. However, the shared information between tasks is not fully explored when using an MTL strategy for training both recommendation and knowledge graph-related tasks. Moreover, most studies cannot effectively model the knowledge sharing, consequently affecting recommendation performance. In response to these problems, we proposed a novel knowledge graph-based personalized multitask enhanced recommendation model. To explore the shared information between tasks, a relation attention mechanism was proposed to distinguish the relative importance of neighborhood information to the central entity. Additionally, we utilized a lightweight graph convolutional network to more effectively aggregate high-order neighborhood information from the knowledge graph. This approach improves the accuracy of neighborhood feature and ensures that more suitable shared information is obtained. Furthermore, we developed a linear interaction component to model knowledge sharing between recommendation and knowledge graph embedding tasks. This component allows for detailed feature interaction learning between items and entities, enhancing the shared feature representation, generalization capabilities, and overall performance of the recommendation system. The experimental results on three public datasets indicate that our model outperforms other benchmark models in CTR prediction and top-$\\boldsymbol{K}$ recommendation.",

      "abstract": "Product search is one of the most effective tools for people to browse and purchase products on e-commerce platforms. Recent advances have mainly focused on ranking products by their likelihood to be purchased through retrieval models. However, they overlook the problem that users may not understand why certain products are retrieved for them. The lack of appropriate explanations can lead to an unsatisfactory user experience and further decrease user trust in the platforms. To address this problem, we propose a Query-aware Explainable Product Search with Reinforcement Knowledge Reasoning, namely QEPS, which uses search behaviors related to the current query to reinforce explanations. Specifically, with the aim of retrieving suitable products with explanations, QEPS takes full advantage of the user-product knowledge graph (KG) and develops a reinforcement learning approach, characterized by the demonstration-guided policy network and query-aware rewards, to perform explicit multi-step reasoning on the KG. The reasoning paths between users and products are automatically derived from the current query-related search behavior, which can provide valuable signals as to why the retrieved products are more likely to satisfy the user's search intent. Empirical experiments on four datasets show that our model achieves remarkable performance and is able to generate reasonable explanations for the search results.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) is a crucial task aimed at enhancing the completeness and accuracy of knowledge graphs (KGs) by filling in missing information. However, existing knowledge graphs face two significant challenges: 1) the negative sampling issues, where false negative samples contain potential true facts, while easy negative samples limit the generalization capacity of KGC models; and 2) the entity conflict issues, many candidate entities exhibit similarities in their explicit structural features, making it difficult for models to make accurate decisions. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel method, CrsKGC-RSAN. For the negative sampling issues, we propose a Relative Self Adversarial Negative Sampling (RSAN) module. RSAN allows for a smaller margin between positive and negative samples compared to traditional self-adversarial sampling, while assigning higher training weights to hard negative samples to address false negative and esay negative sample issues. For the entity conflict issues, we present CrsKGC module, which, in addition to learning explicit structural features of KGs, mines implicit structural features, enhancing the comprehensiveness of feature learning and effectively resolving entity conflicts. Extensive experiments on the FB15K-237 and WN18RR datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results and exhibits compatibility.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the use of probabilistic graphical models, specifically stochastic blockmodels, for the purpose of hierarchical entity clustering on knowledge graphs. These models, seldom used in the Semantic Web community, decompose a graph into a set of probability distributions. The parameters of these distributions are then inferred allowing for their subsequent sampling to generate a random graph. In a non-parametric setting, this allows for the induction of hierarchical clusterings without prior constraints on the hierarchy's structure. Specifically, this is achieved by the integration of the Nested Chinese Restaurant Process and the Stick Breaking Process into the generative model. In this regard, we propose a model leveraging such integration and derive a collapsed Gibbs sampling scheme for its inference. To aid in understanding, we describe the steps in this derivation and provide an implementation for the sampler. We evaluate our model on synthetic and real-world datasets and quantitatively compare against benchmark models. We further evaluate our results qualitatively and find that our model is capable of inducing coherent cluster hierarchies in small scale settings. The work presented in this paper provides the first step for the further application of stochastic blockmodels for knowledge graphs on a larger scale. We conclude the paper with potential avenues for future work on more scalable inference schemes.",

      "abstract": "Although the diagnosis and treatment of depression is a medical field, ICTs and AI technologies are used widely to detect depression earlier in the elderly. These technologies are used to identify behavioral changes in the physical world or sentiment changes in cyberspace, known as symptoms of depression. However, although sentiment and physical changes, which are signs of depression in the elderly, are usually revealed simultaneously, there is no research on them at the same time. To solve the problem, this paper proposes knowledge graph-based cyber–physical view (CPV)-based activity pattern recognition for the early detection of depression, also known as KARE. In the KARE framework, the knowledge graph (KG) plays key roles in providing cross-domain knowledge as well as resolving issues of grammatical and semantic heterogeneity required in order to integrate cyberspace and the physical world. In addition, it can flexibly express the patterns of different activities for each elderly. To achieve this, the KARE framework implements a set of new machine learning techniques. The first is 1D-CNN for attribute representation in relation to learning to connect the attributes of physical and cyber worlds and the KG. The second is the entity alignment with embedding vectors extracted by the CNN and GNN. The third is a graph extraction method to construct the CPV from KG with the graph representation learning and wrapper-based feature selection in the unsupervised manner. The last one is a method of activity-pattern graph representation based on a Gaussian Mixture Model and KL divergence for training the GAT model to detect depression early. To demonstrate the superiority of the KARE framework, we performed the experiments using real-world datasets with five state-of-the-art models in knowledge graph entity alignment.",

      "abstract": "Hyperbolic embeddings excel in encoding hierarchical data, while Euclidean embeddings are more adept at capturing complex semantic relationships through rotation operations. However, advanced Euclidean embedding models face the problem of high dimensionality, while advanced hyperbolic embedding models struggle to accommodate multiple relations and different semantics. To address this problem, we introduce LMH-PKE, a novel model that leverages the Poincaré to embed the hierarchical structure of the relationship graph data. It captures rich semantic relationships in Euclidean and models multiple relations using learnable entity decision boundary parameters. By transforming entities embedded in hyperbolic through Möbius matrix vector multiplication and Möbius addition, and encoding multiple relations in Euclidean space using cosine functions, Our experiments demonstrate that LMH-PKE achieves state-of-the-art results in hyperbolic embedding models while maintaining low dimensional simplicity.",

      "abstract": "Representation learning based on temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) has attracted widespread interest, and temporal knowledge graph embedding (TKGE) expresses time entity and relation tokens and exhibit strong dynamics. Despite the significance of the dynamics and the persistent updates in TKGs, most studies have been devoted to static knowledge graphs. Moreover, previous temporal works ignored the semantic hierarchies observed in knowledge modelling cases, which are common in real-world applications. Inaccurate semantic expressions caused by incomplete projections might not capture complex topological structures very well. To solve this problem, a novel hierarchicaltime-surfaceembedding (HTSE) model is proposed for the representation learning of entities, relations and time. Specifically, a unified relation-oriented hierarchical space aims to distinguish relations at different semantic levels of a hierarchy, and entities can naturally reflect the corresponding hierarchy. Then, a time surface aims to enhance the temporal characteristics, and quadruples are learned through exponential mapping and tangent planes in the time surface. According to extensive experiments, HTSE can achieve remarkable performance on five benchmark datasets, outperforming baseline models for time scope prediction, temporal link prediction and hierarchical relation embedding tasks.Furthermore, the qualitative analysis is used to demonstrate the explainable strategy for hierarchical embeddings and their significance in TKGs.",

We propose a creator-critic framework to learn and deduce temporal orders by combining deep learning and rule-based deduction, referred to as GATE (Get the lATEst). The creator of GATE trains a ranking model via deep learning, to learn temporal orders and rank attribute values based on correlations among the attributes. The critic then validates the temporal orders learned and deduces more ranked pairs by chasing the data with currency constraints; it also provides augmented training data as feedback for the creator to improve the ranking in the next round. The process proceeds until the temporal order obtained becomes stable. Using real-life and synthetic datasets, we show that GATE is able to determine temporal orders with\n F\n -measure above 80%, improving deep learning by 7.8% and rule-based methods by 34.4%.\n",

      "abstract": "As a building block of knowledge acquisition, knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims at inferring missing facts in knowledge graphs (KGs) automatically. Previous studies mainly focus on graph convolutional network (GCN)-based KG embedding (KGE) to determine the representations of entities and relations, accordingly predicting missing triplets. However, most existing KGE methods suffer from limitations in predicting tail entities that are far away or even unreachable in KGs. This limitation can be attributed to the related high-order information being largely ignored. In this work, we focus on learning the information from the related high-order neighbors in KGs to improve the performance of prediction. Specifically, we first introduce a set of new nodes called pedalnodes to augment the KGs for facilitating message passing between related high-order entities, effectively injecting the information of high-order neighbors into entity representation. Additionally, we propose strength-guided graph neural networks to aggregate neighboring entity representations. To address the issue of transmitting irrelevant higher order information to entities through pedal nodes, which can potentially hurt entity representation, we further propose to dynamically integrate the aggregated representation of each node with its corresponding self-representation. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three benchmark datasets and the results demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to strong baseline models.",

However, co-exploitation behavior, referring to multiple vulnerabilities being exploited jointly, poses considerable challenges to the prevention and remediation of cyberattacks. It is difficult to directly predict the co-exploitation relationships between vulnerabilities from existing open-source intelligence (OSINT). In this paper, we propose a novel method for predicting the co-exploitation of vulnerabilities using knowledge reasoning based on a knowledge graph. Specifically, we construct a vulnerability knowledge graph, VulCKG, which contains over 355 K nodes and 4 million relational triples. To get the missing critical relational information within the knowledge graph, we designed a knowledge embedding model, AttTransM, that integrates semantic and structural information for knowledge graph completion (KGC). Experimental results show that AttTransM outperforms other popular models across all evaluation metrics. Finally, we apply rule-based reasoning to predict the co-exploitation relationships between vulnerability entities.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) capture knowledge in the form of head--relation--tail triples and are a crucial component in many AI systems. There are two important reasoning tasks on KGs: (1) single-hop knowledge graph completion, which involves predicting individual links in the KG; and (2), multi-hop reasoning, where the goal is to predict which KG entities satisfy a given logical query. Embedding-based methods solve both tasks by first computing an embedding for each entity and relation, then using them to form predictions. However, existing scalable KG embedding frameworks only support single-hop knowledge graph completion and cannot be applied to the more challenging multi-hop reasoning task. Here we present Scalable Multi-hOp REasoning (SMORE), the first general framework for both single-hop and multi-hop reasoning in KGs. Using a single machine SMORE can perform multi-hop reasoning in Freebase KG (86M entities, 338M edges), which is 1,500x larger than previously considered KGs. The key to SMORE's runtime performance is a novel bidirectional rejection sampling that achieves a square root reduction of the complexity of online training data generation. Furthermore, SMORE exploits asynchronous scheduling, overlapping CPU-based data sampling, GPU-based embedding computation, and frequent CPU--GPU IO. SMORE increases throughput (i.e., training speed) over prior multi-hop KG frameworks by 2.2x with minimal GPU memory requirements (2GB for training 400-dim embeddings on 86M-node Freebase) and achieves near linear speed-up with the number of GPUs. Moreover, on the simpler single-hop knowledge graph completion task SMORE achieves comparable or even better runtime performance to state-of-the-art frameworks on both single GPU and multi-GPU settings.",

      "abstract": "Problems of preeclampsia sign diagnosis are mostly based on symptom data with the characteristics of data collected periodically in uncertain, ambiguous, and obstetrician opinions. To reduce the effects of preeclampsia, many studies have investigated the disease, prevention, and complication. Conventional fuzzy inference techniques can solve several diagnosis problems in health such as fuzzy inference systems (FIS), and Mamdani complex fuzzy inference systems with rule reduction (M-CFIS-R), however, the computation time is quite high. Recently, the research direction of approximate inference based on fuzzy knowledge graph (FKG) has been proposed in the M-CFIS-FKG model with the combination of regimens in traditional medicine and subclinical data gathered from medical records. The paper has presented a proposed model of FKG-Pairs3 to support patients’ disease diagnosis, together with doctors’ preferences in decision-making. The proposed model has been implemented in real-world applications for disease diagnosis in traditional medicine based on input data sets with vague information, quantified by doctor’s preferences. To validate the proposed model, it has been tested in a real-world case study of preeclampsia signs in a hospital for disease diagnosis with the traditional medicine approach. Experimental results show that the proposed model has demonstrated the model’s effectiveness in the decision-making of preeclampsia signs.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning has received significant attention in the fields of artificial intelligence and knowledge engineering, owing to its ability to autonomously deduce new knowledge and consequently enhance the availability and precision of downstream applications. However, current methods predominantly concentrate on a single form of neural or symbolic reasoning, failing to effectively integrate the inherent strengths of both approaches. Furthermore, the current prevalent methods primarily focus on addressing a single reasoning scenario, presenting limitations in meeting the diverse demands of real-world reasoning tasks. Unifying the neural and symbolic methods, as well as diverse reasoning scenarios in one model is challenging as there is a natural representation gap between symbolic rules and neural networks, and diverse scenarios exhibit distinct knowledge structures and specific reasoning objectives. To address these issues, we propose a unified neurosymbolic reasoning framework, namely Tunsr, for KG reasoning. Tunsr first introduces a consistent structure of reasoning graph that starts from the query entity and constantly expands subsequent nodes by iteratively searching posterior neighbors. Based on it, a forward logic message-passing mechanism is proposed to update both the propositional representations and attentions, as well as first-order logic (FOL) representations and attentions of each node. In this way, Tunsr conducts the transformation of merging multiple rules by merging possible relations at each step. Finally, the FARI algorithm is proposed to induce FOL rules by constantly performing attention calculations over the reasoning graph. Extensive experimental results on 19 datasets of four reasoning scenarios (transductive, inductive, interpolation, and extrapolation) demonstrate the effectiveness of Tunsr.",

      "abstract": "Representation learning for link prediction is one of the leading approaches to deal with incompleteness problem of real world knowledge graphs. Such methods are often called knowledge graph embedding models which represent entities and relationships in knowledge graphs in continuous vector spaces. By doing this, semantic relationships and patterns can be captured in the form of compact vectors. In temporal knowledge graphs, the connection of temporal and relational information is crucial for representing facts accurately. Relations provide the semantic context for facts, while timestamps indicate the temporal validity of facts. The importance of time is different for the semantics of different facts. Some relations in some temporal facts are time-insensitive, while others are highly time-dependent. However, existing embedding models often overlook the time sensitivity of different facts in temporal knowledge graphs. These models tend to focus on effectively representing connection between individual components of quadruples, consequently capturing only a fraction of the overall knowledge. Ignoring importance of temporal properties reduces the ability of temporal knowledge graph embedding models in accurately capturing these characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a novel embedding model based on temporal relevance, which can effectively capture the time sensitivity of semantics and better represent facts. This model operates within a complex space with real and imaginary parts to effectively embed temporal knowledge graphs. Specifically, the real part of the final embedding of our proposed model captures semantic characteristic with temporal sensitivity by learning the relational information and temporal information through transformation and attention mechanism. Simultaneously, the imaginary part of the embeddings learns the connections between different elements in the fact without predefined weights. Our approach is evaluated through extensive experiments on the link prediction task, where it majorly outperforms state-of-the-art models. The proposed model also demonstrates remarkable effectiveness in capturing the complexities of temporal knowledge graphs.",

      "abstract": "Many practical graph problems, such as knowledge graph construction and drug-to-drug interaction, require to handle multi-relational graphs. However, handling real-world multi-label graphs with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is often challenging due to their evolving nature, where new entities (nodes) can emerge over time. Moreover, newly emerged entities often have few links, which makes the learning even more difficult. Motivated by this challenge, we introduce a realistic problem of few-shot out-of-graph link prediction, where we not only predict the links between the seen and unseen nodes as in a conventional out-of-knowledge link prediction but also between the unseen nodes, with only few edges per node. We tackle this problem with a novel transductive meta-learning framework which we refer to as Graph Extrapolation Networks (GEN). GEN meta-learns both the node embedding network for inductive inference (seen-to-unseen) and the link prediction network for transductive inference (unseen-to-unseen). For transductive link prediction, we further propose a stochastic embedding layer to model uncertainty in the link prediction between unseen entities. We validate our model on multiple benchmark datasets for knowledge graph link prediction and drug-to-drug interaction prediction. The results show that our model significantly outperforms relevant baselines for out-of-graph link prediction tasks.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding has emerged as a fundamental technique to represent entities and relationships in knowledge graphs within low-dimensional vector spaces. Among these methods, translation-based approaches stand out by treating relations as translations from head entities to tail entities, achieving state-of-the-art results. However, the training process of these methods can be prohibitively time-consuming, especially for large knowledge graphs, posing significant challenges in practical applications. As knowledge graphs grow in size and complexity, surpassing the capacities of existing systems, there is an urgent need for scalable solutions in knowledge representation learning. These graphs, comprising millions of nodes and billions of edges, serve as powerful data structures for representing and understanding complex networks of knowledge. Translation-based models, particularly TransE, have been instrumental in encoding structured information about entities and their relationships in low-dimensional embedding spaces. However, the current implementation of TransE is constrained to single-node machines, limiting its scalability and applicability. To address these limitations, this paper proposes leveraging parallel computing technique, such as parallel TransE with graph partitioning, to enhance scalability and efficiency in knowledge graph embedding.",

      "abstract": "The distributionally robust optimization (DRO)-based graph neural network methods improve recommendation systems' out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization by optimizing the model's worst-case performance. However, these studies fail to consider the impact of noisy samples in the training data, which results in diminished generalization capabilities and lower accuracy. Through experimental and theoretical analysis, this paper reveals that current DRO-based graph recommendation methods assign greater weight to noise distribution, leading to model parameter learning being dominated by it. When the model overly focuses on fitting noise samples in the training data, it may learn irrelevant or meaningless features that cannot be generalized to OOD data. To address this challenge, we design a Distributionally Robust Graph model for OOD recommendation (DRGO). Specifically, our method first employs a simple and effective diffusion paradigm to alleviate the noisy effect in the latent space. Additionally, an entropy regularization term is introduced in the DRO objective function to avoid extreme sample weights in the worst-case distribution. Finally, we provide a theoretical proof of the generalization error bound of DRGO as well as a theoretical analysis of how our approach mitigates noisy sample effects, which helps to better understand the proposed framework from a theoretical perspective. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework against three typical distribution shifts, and the results demonstrate its superiority in both independently and identically distributed distributions (IID) and OOD.",

      "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graph embedding (TKGE) models are commonly utilized to infer the missing facts and facilitate reasoning and decision-making in temporal knowledge graph based systems. However, existing methods fuse temporal information into entities, potentially leading to the evolution of entity information and limiting the link prediction performance of TKG. Meanwhile, current TKGE models often lack the ability to simultaneously model important relation patterns and provide interpretability, which hinders their effectiveness and potential applications. To address these limitations, we propose a novel TKGE model which encodes Temporal knowledge graph embeddings via Archimedean Spiral Timeline (TeAST), which maps relations onto the corresponding Archimedean spiral timeline and transforms the quadruples completion to 3th-order tensor completion problem. Specifically, the Archimedean spiral timeline ensures that relations that occur simultaneously are placed on the same timeline, and all relations evolve over time. Meanwhile, we present a novel temporal spiral regularizer to make the spiral timeline orderly. In addition, we provide mathematical proofs to demonstrate the ability of TeAST to encode various relation patterns. Experimental results show that our proposed model significantly outperforms existing TKGE methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/IMU-MachineLearningSXD/TeAST.",

      "abstract": "The objective of knowledge graph question answering is to assist users in answering questions by utilizing the information stored within the graph. Users are not required to comprehend the underlying data structure. This is a difficult task because, on the one hand, correctly understanding the semantics of a problem is difficult for machines. On the other hand, the growing knowledge graph will inevitably lead to information retrieval errors. Specifically, the question-answering task has three difficulties: word abbreviation, object complement, and entity ambiguity. An object complement means that different entities share the same predicate, and entity ambiguity means that words have different meanings in different contexts. To solve these problems, we propose a novel method named the Chunked Learning Network. It uses different models according to different scenarios to obtain a vector representation of the topic entity and relation in the question. The answer entity representation that yields the closest fact triplet, according to a joint distance metric, is returned as the answer. For sentences with an object complement, we use dependency parsing to construct dependency relationships between words to obtain more accurate vector representations. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

However, real-world KGs do not remain static, but rather evolve and grow in tandem with the development of KG applications. Consequently, new facts and previously unseen entities and relations continually emerge, necessitating an embedding model that can quickly learn and transfer new knowledge through growth. Motivated by this, we delve into an expanding field of KG embedding in this paper, i.e., lifelong KG embedding. We consider knowledge transfer and retention of the learning on growing snapshots of a KG without having to learn embeddings from scratch. The proposed model includes a masked KG autoencoder for embedding learning and update, with an embedding transfer strategy to inject the learned knowledge into the new entity and relation embeddings, and an embedding regularization method to avoid catastrophic forgetting. To investigate the impacts of different aspects of KG growth, we construct four datasets to evaluate the performance of lifelong KG embedding.

      "abstract": "Link prediction models assign scores to predict new, plausible edges to complete knowledge graphs. In link prediction evaluation, the score of an existing edge (positive) is ranked w.r.t. the scores of its synthetically corrupted counterparts (negatives). An accurate model ranks positives higher than negatives, assuming ascending order. Since the number of negatives are typically large for a single positive, link prediction evaluation is computationally expensive. As far as we know, only one approach has proposed to replace rank aggregations by a distance between sample positives and negatives. Unfortunately, the distance does not consider individual ranks, so edges in isolation cannot be assessed. In this paper, we propose an alternative protocol based on posterior probabilities of positives rather than ranks. A calibration function assigns posterior probabilities to edges that measure their plausibility. We propose to assess our alternative protocol in various ways, including whether expected semantics are captured when using different strategies to synthetically generate negatives. Our experiments show that posterior probabilities and ranks are highly correlated. Also, the time reduction of our alternative protocol is quite significant: more than 77% compared to rank-based evaluation. We conclude that link prediction evaluation based on posterior probabilities is viable and significantly reduces computational costs.",

      "abstract": "A multi-agent AI model is used to automate the discovery of new metallic alloys, integrating multimodal data and external knowledge including insights from physics via atomistic simulations. Our multi-agent system features three key components: (a) a suite of LLMs responsible for tasks such as reasoning and planning, (b) a group of AI agents with distinct roles and expertise that dynamically collaborate, and (c) a newly developed graph neural network (GNN) model for rapid retrieval of key physical properties. A set of LLM-driven AI agents collaborate to automate the exploration of the vast design space of MPEAs, guided by predictions from the GNN. We focus on the NbMoTa family of body-centered cubic (bcc) alloys, modeled using an ML-based interatomic potential, and target two key properties: the Peierls barrier and solute/screw dislocation interaction energy. Our GNN model accurately predicts these atomic-scale properties, providing a faster alternative to costly brute-force calculations and reducing the computational burden on multi-agent systems for physics retrieval. This AI system revolutionizes materials discovery by reducing reliance on human expertise and overcoming the limitations of direct all-atom simulations. By synergizing the predictive power of GNNs with the dynamic collaboration of LLM-based agents, the system autonomously navigates vast alloy design spaces, identifying trends in atomic-scale material properties and predicting macro-scale mechanical strength, as demonstrated by several computational experiments. This approach accelerates the discovery of advanced alloys and holds promise for broader applications in other complex systems, marking a significant step forward in automated materials design.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding, which projects symbolic entities and relations into continuous vector spaces, is gaining increasing attention. Previous methods allow a single static embedding for each entity or relation, ignoring their intrinsic contextual nature, i.e., entities and relations may appear in different graph contexts, and accordingly, exhibit different properties. This work presents Contextualized Knowledge Graph Embedding (CoKE), a novel paradigm that takes into account such contextual nature, and learns dynamic, flexible, and fully contextualized entity and relation embeddings. Two types of graph contexts are studied: edges and paths, both formulated as sequences of entities and relations. CoKE takes a sequence as input and uses a Transformer encoder to obtain contextualized representations. These representations are hence naturally adaptive to the input, capturing contextual meanings of entities and relations therein. Evaluation on a wide variety of public benchmarks verifies the superiority of CoKE in link prediction and path query answering. It performs consistently better than, or at least equally well as current state-of-the-art in almost every case, in particular offering an absolute improvement of 19.7% in H@10 on path query answering.

      "abstract": ": The ability to forecast future events brings great benefits for society and cyberspace in many public safety domains, such as civil unrest, pandemics and crimes. The occurrences of new events are often correlated or dependent on historical and concurrent events. Many existing studies learn event-occurring processes with sequential and structural models, which, however, suffer from inefficient and inaccurate prediction problems. To better understand the event forecasting task and characterize the occurrence of new events, we exploit the human cognitive theory from the cognitive neuroscience discipline to find available cues for algorithm design and event prediction. Motivated by the dual process theory, we propose a two-stage learning scheme for event knowledge mining and prediction. First, we screen out event candidates based on historical inherent knowledge. Then we re-rank event candidates by probing into the newest relative events. Our proposed model mimics a sociological phenomenon called “the chameleon effect” and consists of a new target attentive graph collaborative learning mechanism to ensure a better understanding of sophisticated evolution patterns associated with events. In addition, self-supervised contrastive learning is employed to alleviate the over-smoothing problem that existed in graph learning while improving the model’s interpretability.

      "abstract": "Conway's Game of Life (Life), a well known algorithm within the broader class of cellular automata (CA), exhibits complex emergent dynamics, with extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. Modeling and predicting such intricate behavior without explicit knowledge of the system's underlying topology presents a significant challenge, motivating the development of algorithms that can generalize across various grid configurations and boundary conditions. We develop a decoder-only generative pretrained transformer (GPT) model to solve this problem, showing that our model can simulate Life on a toroidal grid with no prior knowledge on the size of the grid, or its periodic boundary conditions (LifeGPT). LifeGPT is topology-agnostic with respect to its training data and our results show that a GPT model is capable of capturing the deterministic rules of a Turing-complete system with near-perfect accuracy, given sufficiently diverse training data. We also introduce the idea of an `autoregressive autoregressor' to recursively implement Life using LifeGPT. Our results pave the path towards true universal computation within a large language model framework, synthesizing of mathematical analysis with natural language processing, and probing AI systems for situational awareness about the evolution of such algorithms without ever having to compute them. Similar GPTs could potentially solve inverse problems in multicellular self-assembly by extracting CA-compatible rulesets from real-world biological systems to create new predictive models, which would have significant consequences for the fields of bioinspired materials, tissue engineering, and architected materials design.",

Firstly, the knowledge graph representation learning method is used to embed the semantic information of the items into a low-dimensional semantic space; then, the semantic similarity between the recommended items is calculated, and then, this item semantic information is fused into the collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm.

      "abstract": "The ongoing and effective application of the knowledge base hinges on the dynamic updating of the knowledge base, which, in turn, depends on the accurate verification of triplets. Current methods struggle to manage unknown new entities and relations or have issues with relation characterization. This paper presents a novel approach to enhance the precision and efficiency of triplet verification during the knowledge base update process, utilizing a combination of a capsule network and an innovative feature known as the capsule network and attentive intratriplet association (CAIA). The method initially draws comprehensive triplet features from both structural and textual data. Following this, association attention values between entities and relations are derived and included with the triplet features as association features. A two-layer capsule network is then used to score the triplets. Experimental results demonstrate that the CAIA method outperforms established baseline methods in three key metrics—H@1, H@3, and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) on FB15k-237-OWE+ and DBPedia50k+ datasets—showing its superior accuracy for entities, and the average increase was about 2.8%. It also excels in relation accuracy, showing the best results for the three metrics of mean rank, H@1, and MRR on both datasets, and the average improvement was about 9.1%. Additionally, more optimal parameter values in the current experimental environment are identified by comparing the effects of the different neuron numbers and capsule numbers. Based on the above research, this paper fills the research gap of deep learning in knowledge base updating.",

Most previous works learn entity-specific embeddings of entities, which cannot handle unseen entities. Recent several methods utilize enclosing subgraph to obtain inductive ability. However, all these works only consider the enclosing part of subgraph without complete neighboring relations, which leads to the issue that partial neighboring relations are neglected, and sparse subgraphs are hard to be handled. To address that, we propose Subgraph Neighboring Relations Infomax, SNRI, which sufficiently exploits complete neighboring relations from two aspects: neighboring relational feature for node feature and neighboring relational path for sparse subgraph. To further model neighboring relations in a global way, we innovatively apply mutual information (MI) maximization for knowledge graph. Experiments show that SNRI outperforms existing state-of-art methods by a large margin on inductive link prediction task, and verify the effectiveness of exploring complete neighboring relations in a global way to characterize node features and reason on sparse subgraphs.",

      "abstract": "Automated visualization recommendation facilitates the rapid creation of effective visualizations, which is especially beneficial for users with limited time and limited knowledge of data visualization. There is an increasing trend in leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques to achieve an end-to-end visualization recommendation. However, existing ML-based approaches implicitly assume that there is only one appropriate visualization for a specific dataset, which is often not true for real applications. Also, they often work like a black box, and are difficult for users to understand the reasons for recommending specific visualizations. To fill the research gap, we propose AdaVis, an adaptive and explainable approach to recommend one or multiple appropriate visualizations for a tabular dataset. It leverages a box embedding-based knowledge graph to well model the possible one-to-many mapping relations among different entities (i.e., data features, dataset columns, datasets, and visualization choices). The embeddings of the entities and relations can be learned from dataset-visualization pairs. Also, AdaVis incorporates the attention mechanism into the inference framework. Attention can indicate the relative importance of data features for a dataset and provide fine-grained explainability. Our extensive evaluations through quantitative metric evaluations, case studies, and user interviews demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaVis.",

In recent years, there has been an increasing amount of research on knowledge graph question answering, but temporal knowledge graph question answering is still a relatively unexplored area. In question answering tasks, many natural language questions have explicit or implicit temporal constraints, and most existing research methods lack the temporal awareness to deal with complex temporal questions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a question answering model based on temporal knowledge graph embedding (TKGETQA). The model uses TKG embeddings to root a question in the entities, relations and time horizons it references, and perceives temporal information from the question to improve the accuracy of answer prediction. Experiments on the dataset CronQuestions in this paper show that the TKGETQA model exhibits better results compared to existing temporal knowledge graph question answering approaches.",

Therefore, the importance of dataset recommendation—identifying relevant datasets for a scientific paper, an author, or a textual query—is increasing. Although various methods have been proposed for this task, their reproducibility remains unexplored, making it difficult to compare them with new approaches. We reviewed current recommendation methods for scientific datasets, focusing on the most recent and competitive approaches, including an SVM-based model, a bi-encoder retriever, a method leveraging co-authors and citation network embeddings, and a heterogeneous variational graph autoencoder. These approaches underwent a comprehensive analysis under consistent experimental conditions. Our reproducibility efforts show that three methods can be reproduced, while the graph variational autoencoder is challenging due to unavailable code and test datasets. Hence, we re-implemented this method and performed a component-based analysis to examine its strengths and limitations. Furthermore, our study indicated that three out of four considered methods produce subpar results when applied to real-world data instead of specialized datasets with ad-hoc features.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, it has witnessed the revival of knowledge engineering, which is characterized by the rapid growth of Knowledge Graph (KGs). Currently, Knowledge Graph Representation (KGR) and Completion (KGC) methods all use the methodology of scoring triple ($e_{h},r, e_{t}$) to judge its correctness. Wherein, in the procedure of conventional Negative Sampling (NS) and reasoning, it is easy to be affected by the low-quality and uncertainty of negative triples related to the given KG, resulting in some unpredictable and inexplicable wrong results that do not conform to commonsense. On the contrary, human beings with commonsense could easily solve this problem. For this reason, this paper proposes a novel mechanism to automatically capture commonsense (concept emphasized here) associated with current KG to provide more deterministic and interpretable semantic information from the fact triple, and further designs a concept-driven negative sampling strategy for commonsense understanding. Overall, a hybrid reasoning approach jointly driven by concept constraints (inter with KG) and fact triple guides (intra with KG), is presented to promote more effective learning and training procedure of KG's representation and completion. Experiments on real-world datasets, show that the proposed work could be used as a flexible plug-in unit to enhance the previous KG representation and completion models.",

Due to excellent performance, state-of-the-art graph mining systems mainly rely on pattern-aware algorithms. Despite previous efforts, complex control flows introduced by pattern-aware algorithms bring significant overhead and also impede further acceleration on heterogeneous hardware. To address these challenges, we propose a set-based equivalent transformation approach to optimize pattern-aware graph mining applications, which can leverage classic set properties to eliminate most control flows and reduce computation overhead exponentially. We further implement a high-performance pattern-aware graph mining system supporting both CPU and GPU, namely GraphSet, to automatically apply these transformations.

      "abstract": "The complexity and diversity of multi-modal knowledge graphs arise from their ability to fuse information from multiple sources. Traditional knowledge graph representation learning faces challenges in effectively capturing and efficiently processing the complexity of multi-modal knowledge graphs. Moreover, conventional methods primarily rely on embeddings, overlooking the richness of multi-modal information, further diminishing the effectiveness of representation learning. To address these issues, this study proposes an Enhanced Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Representation Learning model (MATUCKER) based on the core of TuckER, which adaptively fuses multi-modal information using multi-head self-attention. In this approach, we employ the ResNet model to encode image features of multi-modal entities. These encoded features are then concatenated with the semantic embeddings of multi-modal entities and fed into a multi-head self-attention mechanism for fusion. The resulting multi-modal entity feature encodings are subsequently input into the TuckER model for representation learning. The model's performance is evaluated on the publicly available OpenBG-IMG dataset for link prediction tasks. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms both traditional methods and the multi-modal representation learning model, TransAE, in terms of multi-modal representation learning performance. We achieved significant improvements in key performance metrics compared to the TuckER backbone: the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) increased by 3%, the HITS@10 metric improved by 5%, and the Mean Rank (MR) decreased by approximately 1,000.",

      "abstract": "With the enrichment of user-item interactions, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used in recommender systems to alleviate information overload. Nevertheless, they still suffer from the cold-start issue. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), providing external information, have been extensively applied in GNN-based methods to mitigate this issue. However, current KG-aware recommendation methods suffer from the knowledge imbalance problem caused by incompleteness of existing KGs. This imbalance is reflected by the long-tail phenomenon of item attributes, i.e., unpopular items usually lack more attributes compared to popular items. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel framework called EditKG: Editing Knowledge Graph for Recommendation, to balance attribute distribution of items via editing KGs. EditKG consists of two key designs: Knowledge Generator and Knowledge Deleter. Knowledge Generator generates attributes for items by exploring their mutual information correlations and semantic correlations. Knowledge Deleter removes the task-irrelevant item attributes according to the parameterized task relevance score, while dropping the spurious item attributes through aligning the attribute scores. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that EditKG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and achieves 8.98% average improvement.

In order to construct or continuously enrich KGs, automatic knowledge construction and update mechanisms are usually utilized, which inevitably bring in plenty of noise, and noise would degrade the performance of downstream applications. Existing KG error detection methods utilize the embeddings of entities and relations, or directly leverage the paths between entities to test the plausibility of triples, while ignore the valuable hierarchical information contained in the paths between entities. Indeed, the paths between a pair of entities conform to a hierarchical structure. Specifically, there may be a number of paths between two entities, and each path is comprised of several relations. The hierarchical structure is able to provide precious information, and is beneficial to leverage the path information in a fine-grained manner. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel model named KG error detection with HiErarchical pAth stRucture (HEAR for short). Particularly, for a given triple, HEAR first learns path representations with the relations contained in the path, then integrates all path representations, and at last predicts the plausibility of the triple. Finally, we extensively validate the superiority of HEAR against various state-of-the-art baselines.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) consisting of a large number of triples have become widespread recently, and many knowledge graph embedding (KGE) methods are proposed to embed entities and relations of a KG into continuous vector spaces. Such embedding methods simplify the operations of conducting various in-KG tasks (e.g., link prediction) and out-of-KG tasks (e.g., question answering). They can be viewed as general solutions for representing KGs. However, existing KGE methods are not applicable to inductive settings, where a model trained on source KGs will be tested on target KGs with entities unseen during model training. Existing works focusing on KGs in inductive settings can only solve the inductive relation prediction task. They can not handle other out-of-KG tasks as general as KGE methods since they don't produce embeddings for entities. In this paper, to achieve inductive knowledge graph embedding, we propose a model MorsE, which does not learn embeddings for entities but learns transferable meta-knowledge that can be used to produce entity embeddings. Such meta-knowledge is modeled by entity-independent modules and learned by meta-learning. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms corresponding baselines for in-KG and out-of-KG tasks in inductive settings.",

The main challenge is how to effectively capture users' personalized sequential transitions in check-in trajectory, and various methods have been developed.

To fill this gap, we investigate a time-specific next POI recommendation task, which additionally incorporates the target time information. We propose a brand new Time2Rotation technique to capture the temporal information. Different from conventional methods, we represent timeslots as rotation vectors and then perform the rotation operations. Based on the Time2Rotation technique, we propose a novel rotation-based temporal attention network, namely ROTAN, for the time-specific next POI recommendation task. The ROTAN begins by building a collaborative POI transition graph, capturing the asymmetric temporal influence in sequential transitions. After that, it incorporates temporal information into the modeling of individual check-in trajectories, extracting separate representations for user preference and POI influence to reflect their distinct temporal patterns. Lastly, the target time is integrated to generate recommendations. Extensive experiments are conducted on three real-world datasets, which demonstrates the advantages of the proposed Time2Rotation technique and ROTAN recommendation model.",

With representation learning applied in constructing COVID-19 knowledge graphs, abundant COVID-19-related knowledge collected by clinicians and scientists all over the world can be utilized to deepen their understanding of the mechanism and related biological functions of the disease. However, most existing representation learning models cannot deal well with COVID-19 knowledge graph due to its low-connected star-like structure and various complex nonlinear relationships. Besides, lacking reliable negative triplets is also a difficult problem, yet to be adequately resolved. In this article, we propose a novel representation learning model called translation on hyperplanes with an activation operation and similar semantic sampling (SimH) for COVID-19 knowledge graphs. In our proposed SimH, an activation operation is designed to provide additional interaction features for low-in-degree entities. Then the hyperplane projection technique is introduced to the distance-based scoring function so that those complex nonlinear relationships can be modeled with lower complexity maintained in comparison with other nonlinear models. Moreover, a negative triplet sampling method that adaptively replaces entities with similar semantics is introduced to generate reliable negative triplets. To verify the effectiveness of SimH, extensive experiments are conducted on the COVID-19-Concepts dataset. The experimental results show that our SimH model achieves significant improvements in prediction and classification accuracy over existing knowledge representation learning models.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs), represented as structured head entity-relation-tail entity triples (fact triples), provide a systematic framework for knowledge representation and reasoning across various domains. However, as the scale of KGs expands, challenges such as data sparsity, missing attributes, and incomplete relationships increasingly undermine their effectiveness in tasks like semantic inference and link prediction. Addressing these challenges requires methods capable of capturing and leveraging the latent relational semantics embedded in hierarchical structures. This paper introduces a hierarchical relational learning framework, named HLogic, which emphasizes the structured discovery of hierarchical logic patterns to improve knowledge graph completion. The proposed method integrates embedding-based models with a carefully designed graph neural network that serves as a relational learner, explicitly designed to capture multi-level dependencies through hierarchical logic. By modeling the regularities and patterns inherent in the layered relationships of KGs, HLogic effectively identifies and utilizes the structural and semantic coherence of knowledge graphs. This hierarchical logic-driven approach enhances the consistency and expressiveness of knowledge embeddings. The iterative optimization process further refines the embeddings, preserving both local and global relational semantics while improving link prediction accuracy. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HLogic achieves notable performance improvements in metrics compared to baseline methods. These results underscore the importance of explicitly capturing hierarchical logic regularities and highlight the potential of HLogic to adapt to diverse relational structures. This study not only showcases the value of hierarchical logic in relational learning but also lays the groundwork for future explorations into integrating logic-driven methodologies with advanced graph learning techniques for real-world applications.",

      "abstract": "A large number of bug reports are submitted by users and developers in bug-tracking system every day. It is time-consuming for software maintainers to assign bug reports to appropriate developers for fixing manually. Many bug-triaging methods have been developed to automate this process. However, most previous studies mainly focused on analyzing textual content and failed to make full use of the structured information embedded in the bug-tracking system. In fact, this structured information, which plays an important role in bug triaging, reflects the process of bug tracking and the historical activities. To further improve the performance of automatic bug triaging, in this study, we propose a new representation learning model, PTITransE, for knowledge bases, which extends TransE via enhancing the embeddings with textual entity descriptions and is more suitable for bug triaging. Moreover, we make the first attempt to apply knowledge base and link prediction techniques to bug triaging. For each new bug report, the proposed framework can recommend top-k developers for fixing the bug report by using the learned embeddings of entities and relations. Evaluation is performed on three real-world projects, and the results indicate that our method outperforms baseline bug triaging approaches and can alleviate the cold-start problem in bug triaging.",

      "abstract": "Many rare genetic diseases have recognizable facial phenotypes that serve as diagnostic clues. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in healthcare, their application to rare genetic diseases still faces challenges like hallucination and limited domain knowledge. To address these challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an effective method, while Knowledge Graphs (KGs) provide more accurate and reliable information. In this paper, we constructed a Facial Phenotype Knowledge Graph (FPKG) including 6143 nodes and 19,282 relations and incorporate RAG to alleviate the hallucination of LLMs and enhance their ability to answer rare genetic disease questions. We evaluated eight LLMs across four tasks: domain-specific QA, diagnostic tests, consistency evaluation, and temperature analysis. The results showed that our approach improves both diagnostic accuracy and response consistency. Notably, RAG reduces temperature-induced variability by 53.94%. This study demonstrates that LLMs can effectively incorporate domain-specific KGs to enhance accuracy, and consistency, thereby improving diagnostic decision-making.",

      "abstract": "The objective of the entity alignment (EA) task is to identify entities with identical semantics across distinct knowledge graphs (KGs) situated in the real world, which has garnered extensive recognition in both academic and industrial circles. Within this paper, a pioneering entity alignment framework named PCE-HGTRA is proposed. This framework integrates the relation and property information from varying KGs, along with the heterogeneity information present within the KGs. Firstly, by learning embeddings, this framework captures the similarity that exists between entities present across diverse KGs. Additionally, property triplets in KGs are used to generate property character-level embeddings, facilitating the transfer of entity embeddings from two distinct KGs onto an identical space. Secondly, the framework strengthens the property character-level embeddings using the transitivity rule to increase the count of entity properties. Then, in order to effectively capture the heterogeneous features in the entity neighborhoods, a heterogeneous graph transformer with relation awareness is designed to model the heterogeneous relations in KGs in the framework. Finally, comparative experimental results on four widely recognized real-world datasets demonstrate that PCE-HGTRA performs exceptionally well. In fact, its Hits@1 performance exceeds the best baseline by 7.94%, outperforming seven other state-of-the-art methods.",

We propose a full-view categorization and new taxonomies on these topics. Knowledge graph embedding is organized from four aspects of representation space, scoring function, encoding models, and auxiliary information. For knowledge acquisition, especially knowledge graph completion, embedding methods, path inference, and logical rule reasoning are reviewed. We further explore several emerging topics, including metarelational learning, commonsense reasoning, and temporal knowledge graphs. To facilitate future research on knowledge graphs, we also provide a curated collection of data sets and open-source libraries on different tasks.

Alleviating the notorious incompleteness of real-world KGs, neural methods achieved impressive results in link prediction and complex query answering tasks by learning representations of entities, relations, and queries. Still, most existing query answering methods rely on transductive entity embeddings and cannot generalize to KGs containing new entities without retraining the entity embeddings. In this work, we study the inductive query answering task where inference is performed on a graph containing new entities with queries over both seen and unseen entities. To this end, we devise two mechanisms leveraging inductive node and relational structure representations powered by graph neural networks (GNNs). Experimentally, we show that inductive models are able to perform logical reasoning at inference time over unseen nodes generalizing to graphs up to 500% larger than training ones. Exploring the efficiency--effectiveness trade-off, we find the inductive relational structure representation method generally achieves higher performance, while the inductive node representation method is able to answer complex queries in the inference-only regime without any training on queries and scales to graphs of millions of nodes.

In this paper, A hyper-relational knowledge graph embedding based on type constraints is proposed for n-ary facts. In the model, each hyper-relational fact is represented as a primary triple and a set of key-value pairs. Meanwhile, the previous knowledge of entity types is integrated to learn more accurate semantics. The model captures not only the main structure information encoded by triples in the knowledge graph, but also the information encoded by triples composed of entity types and their associated key-value pairs. A convolutional neural network is used to learn the feature vectors of hyper-relational facts and their type facts, and the prediction score is obtained by combining the two feature vectors through minimum operation and fully connected projection. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the traditional knowledge graph embedding model for link prediction and the MRR index is improved by 25.3% compared to the existing hyper-relation baseline model.",

      "abstract": "This study proposes a deep multidimensional data analytics framework for extracting intricate relationships from knowledge graphs, which tackles the challenge of discovering hidden connections in heterogeneous and high-dimensional datasets. The proposed method unifies three principal elements: Dynamic Meta-Path Penetration, Nested Subgraph Extraction, and Tensor-Graph Fusion, which together permit a structured investigation of hidden connections. Dynamic Meta-Path Penetration applies reinforcement learning to traverse the graph, directed by a reward system prioritizing informative routes. Nested Subgraph Extraction hierarchically aggregates multi-hop dependencies by employing Graph Neural Networks, which identifies structural patterns within localized subgraphs. Tensor-Graph Fusion performs joint factorization on the knowledge graph adjacency tensor and multidimensional data tensors, thereby merging structural and attribute-based information within a common latent space. The PPA-GNN layer coordinates these elements by traversing the graph, eliminating unnecessary connections, and merging cross-modal attributes, thus producing embeddings that capture intricate relationships. Additionally, the penetration depth is established as a metric to measure the minimal distance needed to uncover hidden relationships. Experiments on benchmark datasets show our model achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods in relationship mining tasks, especially in cases with sparse or noisy data. The framework’s ability to integrate heterogeneous data sources and dynamically adapt to graph structures makes it suitable for applications in recommendation systems, biomedical discovery, and social network analysis. This study propels the discipline forward by introducing a cohesive framework for penetrative analytics, which connects graph-based and tensor-based approaches.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to study the embedding representation to solve the incompleteness of knowledge graphs (KGs). Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and graph attention networks (GATs) have been widely used in KGC tasks by capturing neighbor information of entities. However, Both GCNs and GATs based KGC models have their limitations, and the best method is to analyze the neighbors of each entity (pre-validating), while this process is prohibitively expensive. Furthermore, the representation quality of the embeddings can affect the aggregation of neighbor information (message passing). To address the above limitations, we propose a novel knowledge graph completion model with mixed geometry message and trainable convolutional attention network named MGTCA. Concretely, the mixed geometry message function generates rich neighbor message by integrating spatially information in the hyperbolic space, hypersphere space and Euclidean space jointly. To complete the autonomous switching of graph neural networks (GNNs) and eliminate the necessity of pre-validating the local structure of KGs, a trainable convolutional attention network is proposed by comprising three types of GNNs in one trainable formulation. Furthermore, a mixed geometry scoring function is proposed, which calculates scores of triples by novel prediction function and similarity function based on different geometric spaces. Extensive experiments on three standard datasets confirm the effectiveness of our innovations, and the performance of MGTCA is significantly improved compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstract": "Many existing knowledge graph embedding methods achieve outstanding performance by exploiting the graph structure, among which graph neural network-based methods that utilize the local neighborhood are the most representative. However, the shallow network structure of graph neural networks limits the model’s expressiveness, and the existing problem of over-smoothing also prevents the model from capturing long-distance information. To address these issues, we propose a Transformer-based knowledge graph embedding method that combines graph paths and local neighborhood (TKGE-PN). First, it samples multiple graph paths by using a biased random walk algorithm starting from the central entity. Then these sampled paths are transformed into vector representations by a Transformer-based graph path encoding module. Finally, the local neighborhood encoding module aggregates all graph path vector representations to score triples. During the graph path encoding process, a masked entity relation prediction task is used to enhance the model’s ability to learn long-distance information. Experimental results show that on two standard datasets, FB15k-237 and WN18RR, the performance of TKGE-PN surpasses that of most existing models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.",

To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the study of its properties was carried out and the results were compared with the results of the existing methods used for predicting relations in the knowledge graphs.

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graph represents the real world's information in the form of triplets (head, relation, and tail). However, most Knowledge Graphs are highly incomplete. The goal of a Knowledge-Graph Completion task is to predict missing links in a given Knowledge Graph. Various approaches exist to predict a missing link in a Knowledge Graph, but the most prominent approaches are based on tensor factorization and Knowledge-Graph embeddings, such as RotatE and SimplE. The RotatE model depicts each relation as a rotation from the source entity (Head) to the target entity (Tail) via a complex vector space. In RotatE, the head and tail entities are derived from one embedding-generation class, resulting in a relatively low prediction score. SimplE is primarily based on a Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition. SimplE enhances the CP approach by adding the inverse relation where head embedding and tail embedding are taken from the different embedding-generation class, but they are still dependent on each other. However, SimplE is not able to predict composition patterns. This paper presents a new, hybridized variant (HRotatE) of the existent RotatE approach. Essentially, HRotatE is hybridized from RotatE and SimplE. We have used the principle of inverse embedding (from the SimplE model) in a bid to improve the prediction scores of HRotatE. Hence, our results have proven to be better than the native RotatE. Also, HRotatE outperforms several state-of-the-art models on different datasets. Conclusively, our proposed approach (HRotatE) is relatively efficient such that it utilizes half the number of training steps required by RotatE, and it generates approximately the same result as RotatE.",

      "abstract": "Reasoning paths are reliable information in knowledge graph completion (KGC) in which algorithms can find strong clues of the actual relation between entities. However, in real-world applications, it is difficult to guarantee that computationally affordable paths exist toward all candidate entities. According to our observation, the prediction accuracy drops significantly when paths are absent. To make the proposed algorithm more stable against the missing path circumstances, we introduce soft reasoning paths. Concretely, a specific learnable latent path embedding is concatenated to each relation to help better model the characteristics of the corresponding paths. The combination of the relation and the corresponding learnable embedding is termed a soft path in our paper. By aligning the soft paths with the reasoning paths, a learnable embedding is guided to learn a generalized path representation of the corresponding relation. In addition, we introduce a hierarchical ranking strategy to make full use of information about the entity, relation, path, and soft path to help improve both the efficiency and accuracy of the model. Extensive experimental results illustrate that our algorithm outperforms the compared state-of-the-art algorithms by a notable margin.

While gaining the ability to reason over large-scale knowledge graphs, the latter sacrifices reasoning accuracy. This paper aims to design a reasoning framework called Neural Probabilistic Logic Learning(NPLL) that achieves accurate reasoning on knowledge graphs. Our approach introduces a scoring module that effectively enhances the expressive power of embedding networks, striking a balance between model simplicity and reasoning capabilities.

To alleviate this weakness, we propose an Arabic knowledge enriched reader model, which fuses external knowledge into contextual representation using an attention and gating mechanism. We learn and generate Arabic knowledge graph embeddings that represent information from Arabic Wikidata and utilize this representation when fusing knowledge. We adopted a knowledge graph embedding scoring function to select the most relevant concepts to the context from the knowledge graph.

This survey provides a comprehensive overview of advancements, techniques, and challenges in the field of neural symbolic KG reasoning. The survey introduces the fundamental concepts of KGs and symbolic logic, followed by an exploration of three significant KG reasoning tasks: KG completion, complex query answering, and logical rule learning. For each task, we thoroughly discuss three distinct categories of methods: pure symbolic methods, pure neural approaches, and the integration of neural networks and symbolic reasoning methods known as neural-symbolic. We carefully analyze and compare the strengths and limitations of each category of methods to provide a comprehensive understanding. By synthesizing recent research contributions and identifying open research directions, this survey aims to equip researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of the state-of-the-art in neural symbolic KG reasoning, fostering future advancements in this interdisciplinary domain.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Pre-trained language representation models (PLMs) cannot well capture factual knowledge from text. In contrast, knowledge embedding (KE) methods can effectively represent the relational facts in knowledge graphs (KGs) with informative entity embeddings, but conventional KE models cannot take full advantage of the abundant textual information. In this paper, we propose a unified model for Knowledge Embedding and Pre-trained LanguagERepresentation (KEPLER), which can not only better integrate factual knowledge into PLMs but also produce effective text-enhanced KE with the strong PLMs. In KEPLER, we encode textual entity descriptions with a PLM as their embeddings, and then jointly optimize the KE and language modeling objectives. Experimental results show that KEPLER achieves state-of-the-art performances on various NLP tasks, and also works remarkably well as an inductive KE model on KG link prediction. Furthermore, for pre-training and evaluating KEPLER, we construct Wikidata5M1 , a large-scale KG dataset with aligned entity descriptions, and benchmark state-of-the-art KE methods on it. It shall serve as a new KE benchmark and facilitate the research on large KG, inductive KE, and KG with text. The source code can be obtained from https://github.com/THU-KEG/KEPLER.",

To overcome this limitation of biomedical FMs, we present BioBridge, a novel parameter-efficient learning framework, to bridge independently trained unimodal FMs to establish multimodal behavior. BioBridge achieves it by utilizing Knowledge Graphs (KG) to learn transformations between one unimodal FM and another without fine-tuning any underlying unimodal FMs. Our empirical results demonstrate that BioBridge can beat the best baseline KG embedding methods (on average by around 76.3%) in cross-modal retrieval tasks. We also identify BioBridge demonstrates out-of-domain generalization ability by extrapolating to unseen modalities or relations. Additionally, we also show that BioBridge presents itself as a general purpose retriever that can aid biomedical multimodal question answering as well as enhance the guided generation of novel drugs.",

To investigate the characteristics of cross‐domain knowledge diffusion from science to policy, this study suggests using the citation of policies to scientific articles as a basis for quantifying the diffusion strength, breadth, and speed. The study reveals that the strength and breadth of cross‐domain knowledge diffusion from scientific papers to policies conform to a power‐law distribution, while the speed follows a logarithmic normal distribution. Moreover, the papers with the highest diffusion strength, breadth, and fastest diffusion speed are predominantly from world‐renowned universities, scholars, and top journals. The papers with the highest diffusion strength and breadth are mostly from social sciences, especially economics, those with the fastest diffusion speed are mainly from medical and life sciences, followed by social sciences. The findings indicate that cross‐domain knowledge diffusion from science to policy follows the Matthew effect, whereby individuals or institutions with high academic achievements are more likely to achieve successful cross‐domain knowledge diffusion. Furthermore, papers in the field of economics tend to have the higher cross‐domain knowledge diffusion strength and breadth, while those in medical and life sciences have the faster cross‐domain knowledge diffusion speed.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is an effective method for link prediction in knowledge graphs, with numerous models demonstrating significant success. However, many existing KGE models struggle to effectively represent complex relationships and often face challenges related to a substantial number of missing triples. While enhancing KGE models through analogical reasoning offers a potential solution, current approaches typically depend on positive samples that are similar to the target for learning analogy embeddings. In real-world applications, data imbalance and incompleteness hinder the identification of sufficient positive examples, resulting in suboptimal performance in analogical inference. To this end, we propose a novel enhanced framework called Ne_AnKGE, which is based on negative analogical reasoning. First, Ne_AnKGE uses negative sample analogical reasoning to mitigate the scarcity of similar positive samples in analogical reasoning, while enhancing the link prediction ability of the basic model. Additionally, to enhance the model’s ability to represent complex relationships and overcome the limitations of relying on a single KGE model, the Ne_AnKGE framework integrates the outputs of TransE and RotatE, both of which have been enhanced through negative sample analogical reasoning. Extensive experiments on the FB15K-237 and WN18RR datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of Ne_AnKGE.",

Knowledge representation learning aims to learn low-dimensional dense representations of entities and relations from structured knowledge graphs, and most models use the triplets to capture semantic, logical, and topological features between entities and relations. In order to extend the generalization capability of the network representation learning models, this paper proposes a network representation learning algorithm based on multiple remodeling of node attributes named MRNR. The model constructs the knowledge triplets through the textual association relationships between nodes. Meanwhile, a novel co-occurrence word training method has been proposed. Multiple remodeling of node attributes can significantly improve the effectiveness of network representation learning. At the same time, MRNR introduces the attention mechanism to achieve the weight information for key co-occurrence words and triplets, which further models the semantic and topological features between entities and relations, and it makes the network embedding more accurate and has better generalization ability.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has been identified as an effective method for link prediction, which involves predicting missing relations or entities based on existing entities or relations. KGE is an important method for implementing knowledge representation and, as such, has been widely used in driving intelligent applications w.r.t. question-answering systems, recommendation systems, and relationship extraction. Models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved good results in link prediction. However, as the coverage areas of knowledge graphs expand, the increasing volume of information significantly limits the performance of these models. This article introduces a triple-attention-based multi-channel CNN model, named ConvAMC, for the KGE task. In the embedding representation module, entities and relations are embedded into a complex space and the embeddings are performed in an alternating pattern. This approach helps in capturing richer semantic information and enhances the expressive power of the model. In the encoding module, a multi-channel approach is employed to extract more comprehensive interaction features. A triple attention mechanism and max pooling layers are used to ensure that interactions between spatial dimensions and output tensors are captured during the subsequent tensor concatenation and reshaping process, which allows preserving local and detailed information. Finally, feature vectors are transformed into prediction targets for embedding through the Hadamard product of feature mapping and reshaping matrices. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of ConvAMC on three benchmark datasets compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrating that the proposed model outperforms all compared models across all evaluation metrics on two of the datasets, and achieves advanced link prediction results on most evaluation metrics on the third dataset.",

      "abstract": "In response to the shortcomings of existing knowledge graph embedding strategies, such as weak feature interaction and latent knowledge representation, a unique hydraulic knowledge graph embedding method is suggested. The proposed method incorporates spatial position features into the entity-relation embedding process, thereby enhancing the representation capability of latent knowledge. Furthermore, it utilizes a multi-layer convolutional neural network to fuse features at different levels, effectively capturing more abundant semantic information. Additionally, the method employs multi-scale dilated convolution kernels to capture rich explicit interaction features across different scales of space. In this study, the effectiveness of the proposed model was validated on the link prediction task. Experimental results demonstrated that, compared to the ConvE model, the proposed model achieved a significant improvement of 14.8% in terms of mean reciprocal rank (MRR) on public datasets. Additionally, the suggested model outperformed the ConvR model on the hydraulic dataset, leading to a 10.1% increase in MRR. The results indicate that the proposed approach exhibits good applicability and performance in the task of hydraulic knowledge graph complementation. This suggests that the method has the potential to offer significant assistance for knowledge discovery and application research in the field of hydraulics.",

      "abstract": "This paper studies the security issues for cyber–physical systems, aimed at countering potential malicious cyber-attacks. The main focus is on solving the problem of extracting the most vulnerable attack path in a known attack graph, where an attack path is a sequence of steps that an attacker can take to compromise the underlying network. Determining an attacker’s possible attack path is critical to cyber defenders as it helps identify threats, harden the network, and thwart attacker’s intentions. We formulate this problem as a path-finding optimization problem with logical constraints represented by AND and OR nodes. We propose a new Dijkstra-type algorithm that combines elements from Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm and the critical path method. Although the path extraction problem is generally NP-hard, for the studied special case, the proposed algorithm determines the optimal attack path in polynomial time, O(nm), where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges in the attack graph. To our knowledge this is the first exact polynomial algorithm that can solve the path extraction problem for different attack graphs, both cycle-containing and cycle-free. Computational experiments with real and synthetic data have shown that the proposed algorithm consistently and quickly finds optimal solutions to the problem.",

      "abstract": "Existing studies have shown that user-item interaction data and social relation data can be jointly used for enhancing the performance of social recommendation. However, limited research has a focus on investigating how to deeply exploit different views of social interaction structures and rating behavior differences for further improving social recommendation. To this end, in this paper, we propose to integrate information from both semantic and structural views for social recommendation. Specifically, we first design a collective intelligence-based strategy to reveal high-quality implicit relations for both users and items. Then, by reformulating all available nodes and relations as a heterogeneous graph, we define multiple semantic metapaths to capture diverse preferences for comprehensive user and item representations. While various metapaths enlarge the representation capacity of users and items, they also introduce noise and irrelevant information. We recall that, for the user-item interaction graph, different structure sizes (e.g., local and global structures) provide diverse and complementary information for recommendation. Motivated by this, we propose a semantic and structural view fusion framework for social recommendation (S4Rec), which consists of a deep graph model and a wide attentive SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) model for rating prediction by taking the local and global structure as input and aggregating messages along the predefined metapaths. Finally, the two predicted results are adaptively fused to achieve the final both accurate and stable prediction. In addition, we treat the user's rating behavior difference as the relative position difference problem in the embedding space, and model it with TransH to improve the generalization ability of the main rating model. Extensive experiments on three open datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework compared with state-of-the-art methods. Particularly, our model outperforms other baselines under different sparsity conditions, further validating the effectiveness on cold-start users.

      "abstract": "By representing knowledge in a primary triple associated with additional attribute-value qualifiers, hyper-relational knowledge graph (HKG) that generalizes triple-based knowledge graph (KG) has been attracting research attention recently. Compared with KG, HKG is enriched with the semantic qualifiers as well as the hyper-relational graph structure. However, to model HKG, existing studies mainly focus on either semantic information or structural information therein, which however fail to capture both simultaneously. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we generalize the hyperedge expansion in hypergraph learning and propose an equivalent transformation for HKG modeling, referred to as TransEQ. Specifically, the equivalent transformation transforms a HKG to a KG, which considers both semantic and structural characteristics. Then an encoder-decoder framework is developed to bridge the modeling research between KG and HKG. In the encoder part, KG-based graph neural networks are leveraged for structural modeling; while in the decoder part, various HKG-based scoring functions are exploited for semantic modeling. Especially, we design the sharing embedding mechanism in the encoder-decoder framework with semantic relatedness captured. We further theoretically prove that TransEQ preserves complete information in the equivalent transformation, and also achieves full expressivity. Finally, extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of TransEQ in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. On the largest benchmark WikiPeople, TransEQ significantly improves the state-of-the-art models by 15\\% on MRR.",

      "abstract": "Research on knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has emerged as an active field in which most existing KGE approaches mainly focus on static structural data and ignore the influence of temporal variation involved in time-aware triples. In order to deal with this issue, several temporal knowledge graph embedding (TKGE) approaches have been proposed to integrate temporal and structural information in recent years. However, these methods only employ a uniformly random sampling to construct negative facts. As a consequence, the corrupted samples are often too simplistic for training an effective model. In this paper, we propose a new temporal knowledge graph embedding framework by introducing adversarial learning to further refine the performance of traditional TKGE models. In our framework, a generator is utilized to construct high-quality plausible quadruples and a discriminator learns to obtain the embeddings of entities and relations based on both positive and negative samples. Meanwhile, we also apply a Gumbel-Softmax relaxation and the Wasserstein distance to prevent vanishing gradient problems on discrete data; an inherent flaw in traditional generative adversarial networks. Through comprehensive experimentation on temporal datasets, the results indicate that our proposed framework can attain significant improvements based on benchmark models and also demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of our framework.",

      "title": "Flow to Candidate: Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning With Candidate-Oriented Relational Graph",
      "abstract": "Reasoning over temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) is a challenging task that requires models to infer future events based on past facts. Currently, subgraph-based methods have become the state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques for this task due to their superior capability to explore local information in knowledge graphs (KGs). However, while previous methods have been effective in capturing semantic patterns in TKG, they are hard to capture more complex topological patterns. In contrast, path-based methods can efficiently capture relation paths between nodes and obtain relation patterns based on the order of relation connections. But subgraphs can retain much more information than a single path. Motivated by this observation, we propose a new subgraph-based approach to capture complex relational patterns. The method constructs candidate-oriented relational graphs to capture the local structure of TKGs and introduces a variant of a graph neural network model to learn the graph structure information between query-candidate pairs. In particular, we first design a prior directed temporal edge sampling method, which is starting from the query node and generating multiple candidate-oriented relational graphs simultaneously. Next, we propose a recursive propagation architecture that can encode all relational graphs in the local structures in parallel. Additionally, we introduce a self-attention mechanism in the propagation architecture to capture the query’s preference. Finally, we design a simple scoring function to calculate the candidate nodes’ scores and generate the model’s predictions. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (ICEWS14, ICEWS18, ICEWS0515, and YAGO). Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach possesses stronger inference and faster convergence than the SOTA methods. In addition, our method provides a relational graph for each query-candidate pair, which offers interpretable evidence for TKG prediction results.",

      "abstract": "Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) incorporate a temporal dimension, allowing for a precise capture of the evolution of knowledge and reflecting the dynamic nature of the real world. Typically, TKGs contain complex geometric structures, with various geometric structures interwoven. However, existing Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion (TKGC) methods either model TKGs in a single space or neglect the heterogeneity of different curvature spaces, thus constraining their capacity to capture these intricate geometric structures. In this paper, we propose a novel Integrating Multi-curvature shared and specific Embedding (IME) model for TKGC tasks. Concretely, IME models TKGs into multi-curvature spaces, including hyperspherical, hyperbolic, and Euclidean spaces. Subsequently, IME incorporates two key properties, namely space-shared property and space-specific property. The space-shared property facilitates the learning of commonalities across different curvature spaces and alleviates the spatial gap caused by the heterogeneous nature of multi-curvature spaces, while the space-specific property captures characteristic features. Meanwhile, IME proposes an Adjustable Multi-curvature Pooling (AMP) approach to effectively retain important information. Furthermore, IME innovatively designs similarity, difference, and structure loss functions to attain the stated objective. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the superior performance of IME over existing state-of-the-art TKGC models.",

      "abstract": "Entity alignment in knowledge graphs plays a crucial role in ensuring the consistency and integration of data across different domains. For example, in power topology, accurate entity matching is essential for optimizing system design and control. However, traditional approaches to entity alignment often rely heavily on language models to extract general features, which can overlook important logical aspects such as temporal and event-centric relationships that are crucial for precise alignment.To address this issue, we propose EAL (Entity Alignment with Logical Capturing), a novel and lightweight RNN-based framework designed to enhance logical feature learning in entity alignment tasks. EAL introduces a logical paradigm learning module that effectively models complex-event relationships, capturing structured and context-aware logical patterns that are essential for alignment. This module encodes logical dependencies between entities to dynamically capture both local and global temporal-event interactions. Additionally, we integrate an adaptive logical attention mechanism that prioritizes influential logical features based on task-specific contexts, ensuring the extracted features are both relevant and discriminative. EAL also incorporates a key feature alignment framework that emphasizes critical event-centric logical structures. This framework employs a hierarchical feature aggregation strategy combining low-level information on temporal events with high-level semantic patterns, enabling robust entity matching while maintaining computational efficiency. By leveraging a multi-stage alignment process, EAL iteratively refines alignment predictions, optimizing both precision and recall. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of EAL, which not only achieves superior performance in entity alignment tasks but also provides a lightweight yet powerful solution that reduces reliance on large language models.",

However, this approach fails to effectively integrate the semantic feature information of multi-hop neighbors due to the significant complexity of relations when attempting to learn continuous vectors for entities. To overcome this limitation, this study introduces Multi-Hop Message Passing Graph Convolutional Network (MMPGCN), a novel framework for GCNs that effectively integrates feature information from indirect neighbors in a novel manner. Furthermore, the graph attention mechanism is utilized in the proposed model to differentiate the weights of various indirect neighbors. A robust and expressive balancing gate mechanism is designed to integrate the information from both direct and indirect neighbors to produce the ultimate representation.

      "abstract": "Civil unrest, a major trouble in the country's progress, requires timely detection and prevention. It causes numerous major issues, including loss of life and injury, resource depletion, political instability, and violations of human rights. Automating the early warning civil unrest event prediction with social media data becomes critically important. Existing baseline methods through text datasets obtained from social media have shown promising results. However, most existing baseline methods are domain-specific and lacking in robustness and generalization. As of now, there has been less work done addressing these issues in civil unrest event prediction. To overcome these limitations, this article presents a novel method as CUP_CDLSTM by combining the convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) model and the pretrained distilBERT model to predict civil unrest event prediction using social media data. First, the proposed CUP_CDLSTM model utilizes the LSTM model to learn temporal features followed by CNN utilized to learn spatial features from the correlation matrix of different features. DistilBERT is utilized to generate weighted word embedding to advance the contextual features. The proposed CUP_CDLSTM model is trained with two datasets of different geographical locations for predicting civil unrest events which include spatial, temporal, and event weights as input features. The proposed CUP_CDLSTM model outperforms the baseline methods by up to 5% on both the Hong Kong protest dataset and the black lives matter (BLM) protest dataset in terms of accuracy. It has shown significantly faster training and inference times than existing baseline models.",

      "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) have been widely used in various fields that model the dynamics of facts along the timeline. In the extrapolation setting of TKG reasoning, since facts happening in the future are entirely unknowable, insight into history is the key to predicting future facts. However, it is still a great challenge for existing models as they hardly learn the characteristics of historical events adequately. From the perspective of historical development laws, comprehensively considering the sequential, repetitive, and cyclical patterns of historical facts is conducive to predicting future facts. To this end, we propose a novel representation learning model for TKG reasoning, namely TiRGN, a time-guided recurrent graph network with local-global historical patterns. Specifically, TiRGN uses a local recurrent graph encoder network to model the historical dependency of events at adjacent timestamps and uses the global history encoder network to collect repeated historical facts. After the trade-off between the two encoders, the final inference is performed by a decoder with periodicity. We use six benchmark datasets to evaluate the proposed method. The experimental results show that TiRGN outperforms the state-of-the-art TKG reasoning methods in most cases.",

      "abstract": "Inductive knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to infer the missing relation for a set of newly-coming entities that never appeared in the training set. Such a setting is more in line with reality, as real-world KGs are constantly evolving and introducing new knowledge. Recent studies have shown promising results using message passing over subgraphs to embed newly-coming entities for inductive KGC. However, the inductive capability of these methods is usually limited by two key issues. (i) KGC always suffers from data sparsity, and the situation is even exacerbated in inductive KGC where new entities often have few or no connections to the original KG. (ii) Cold-start problem. It is over coarse-grained for accurate KG reasoning to generate representations for new entities by gathering the local information from few neighbors. To this end, we propose a novel iNfOmax RelAtion Network, namely NORAN, for inductive KG completion. It aims to mine latent relation patterns for inductive KG completion. Specifically, by centering on relations, NORAN provides a hyper view towards KG modeling, where the correlations between relations can be naturally captured as entity-independent logical evidence to conduct inductive KGC. Extensive experiment results on five benchmarks show that our framework substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art KGC methods.",

      "abstract": "Enterprise competition analysis has long been treated as a crucial task of management science, which can reveal pertinent information about market saturation and business opportunities to support the decision-making process of entrepreneurs and investors. Recently, with the development of graph representation techniques, enterprises could be now formulated in a novel graph-oriented perspective to model their cooperation and competition in a directional graph. However, these prior arts mainly treat the enterprises as individual nodes, while the ecosystems, i.e., enterprise groups formed based on their common interests, and consequent interaction effects have been largely ignored. To address this issue, in this article, by adapting the concept of hypergraph to describe enterprise ecosystems, we propose a novel multiview enterprise relation network (MERN) framework for enterprise competition analysis. Specifically, we first put forward a hypertranslating embedding (HTransE) algorithm inspired by translation distance models for the hyperrelation embedding of ecosystems. Meanwhile, a relational graph convolutional network (RGCN) is designed for ordinary relation embedding, e.g., supplier, client, or competitor. Afterward, considering the commercial diversity in ecosystems, which means that different enterprises may focus on different industry fields, we propose an industry trend embedding module to describe industry distribution and development trend factors for each enterprise. Finally, we apply the self-attention mechanism to integrate these three modules and adapt the bilinear model DistMult for competition link analysis. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset validate that our solution can achieve better performance compared with several competitive baselines.",

      "abstract": "Cyber-attack activities are complex and ever-changing, posing severe challenges to cybersecurity personnel. Introducing knowledge graphs into the field of cybersecurity helps depict the intricate cybersecurity landscape and provides technical support for threat identification and situational awareness. However, during the process of constructing knowledge graphs, inevitable noise and conflicts may be introduced, leading to misleading inferences and decisions. This paper aims to address the issues of constructing and assessing the quality of cybersecurity knowledge graphs. We manually constructed a dataset of cybersecurity knowledge graphs (CS13K) and expanded the existing cybersecurity ontology, building a more versatile ontology applicable to existing data features. Building upon this, we utilized Neo4j to construct the cybersecurity knowledge graph. Furthermore, we propose an AttTucker model, based on Transformer, for assessing the quality of knowledge graphs. By employing numerous self-attention heads, this model captures latent information among entities and relations. While reducing the dimensionality of knowledge embeddings, the model achieves evaluation results comparable to high-dimensional embeddings. Finally, we incorporate the path-level information between entities in the knowledge graph into the evaluation of knowledge graph quality based on the AttTucker model. Experimental analysis on both generic datasets and cybersecurity datasets demonstrates that our model significantly improves F1 value and accuracy in knowledge graph quality assessment tasks, outperforming other models.",

That is, linked data and bio-ontologies are employed in databases to maintain data integrity, data organization, and to empower search capabilities. However, linked data and bio-ontologies are more recently being used to represent information as multi-relational heterogeneous graphs, “knowledge graphs”. The reason being, entities and relations in the knowledge graph can be represented as embedding vectors in semantic space, and these embedding vectors have been used to predict relationships between entities. Such knowledge graph embedding methods provide a practical approach to data analytics and increase chances of building machine learning models with high prediction accuracy that can enhance decision support systems. Here, we present a comparative assessment and a standard benchmark for knowledge graph-based representation learning methods focused on the link prediction task for biological relations. We systematically investigated and compared state-of-the-art embedding methods based on the design settings used for training and evaluation. We further tested various strategies aimed at controlling the amount of information related to each relation in the knowledge graph and its effects on the final performance. We also assessed the quality of the knowledge graph features through clustering and visualization and employed several evaluation metrics to examine their uses and differences. Based on this systematic comparison and assessments, we identify and discuss the limitations of knowledge graph-based representation learning methods and suggest some guidelines for the development of more improved methods.",

      "abstract": "Query embedding approaches answer complex logical queries over incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs) by computing and operating on low-dimensional vector representations of entities, relations, and queries. However, current query embedding models heavily rely on excessively parameterized neural networks and cannot explain the knowledge learned from the graph. We propose a novel query embedding method, AConE, which explains the knowledge learned from the graph in the form of $SROI^-$ description logic axioms while being more parameter-efficient than most existing approaches. AConE associates queries to a $SROI^-$ description logic concept. Every $SROI^-$ concept is embedded as a cone in complex vector space, and each $SROI^-$ relation is embedded as a transformation that rotates and scales cones. We show theoretically that AConE can learn $SROI^-$ axioms, and defines an algebra whose operations correspond one to one to $SROI^-$ description logic concept constructs. Our empirical study on multiple query datasets shows that AConE achieves superior results over previous baselines with fewer parameters. Notably on the WN18RR dataset, AConE achieves significant improvement over baseline models. We provide comprehensive analyses showing that the capability to represent axioms positively impacts the results of query answering.",

      "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) can effectively model the ever-evolving nature of real-world knowledge, and their completeness and enhancement can be achieved by reasoning new events from existing ones. However, reasoning accuracy is adversely impacted due to an imbalance between new and recurring events in the datasets. To achieve more accurate TKG reasoning, we propose an attention masking-based contrastive event network (AMCEN) with local-global temporal patterns for the two-stage prediction of future events. In the network, historical and non-historical attention mask vectors are designed to control the attention bias towards historical and non-historical entities, acting as the key to alleviating the imbalance. A local-global message-passing module is proposed to comprehensively consider and capture multi-hop structural dependencies and local-global temporal evolution for the in-depth exploration of latent impact factors of different event types. A contrastive event classifier is used to classify events more accurately by incorporating local-global temporal patterns into contrastive learning. Therefore, AMCEN refines the prediction scope with the results of the contrastive event classification, followed by utilizing attention masking-based decoders to finalize the specific outcomes. The results of our experiments on four benchmark datasets highlight the superiority of AMCEN. Especially, the considerable improvements in Hits@1 prove that AMCEN can make more precise predictions about future occurrences.",

      "abstract": "As the basis of many knowledge graph completion tasks, the embedding representation of entities and relations in knowledge graph (KG) is an important task in the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). While most of the existing knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models based on convolutional neural network (CNN) can obtain abundant feature embedding, they may ignore an important fact that the triples in the KG come from the text, as they simply learn about the feature embedding of entities and relations without considering contextual information. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an effective KGE model based on neural network. First of all, we convert the triple (h,r,t) of the KG into a sentence [h r t]. Then, the LSTM neural network is used to learn the long-term dependence of sentences from the input feature vectors. Then, on this basis, the two-layer convolutional neural network with several different filters is used to extract different local features. Finally, the obtained feature vectors are connected together, and the inner product is carried out with the weight vectors to obtain the score of the triple, so as to judge the validity of the given triple. We evaluate our model on two benchmark datasets FB15k-237 and WN18RR, the experimental results show that the model can effectively improve the accuracy of link prediction, achieving better results compared with other baseline models.",

      "abstract": "Jointly learning embeddings from text and a Knowledge Graph benefits both word and entity/relation embeddings by taking advantage of both large-scale unstructured content (text) and high-quality structured data (the Knowledge Graph). Current techniques leverage anchors to associate entities in the Knowledge Graph to corresponding words in the text corpus; these anchors are then used to generate additional learning samples during the embedding learning process. However, we show in this paper that such techniques yield suboptimal results, as they fail to control the amount of shared information between the two data sources during the joint learning process. Moreover, the additional learning samples often incur significant computational overhead. Aiming at releasing the power of such joint embeddings, we propose JOINER, a new joint text and Knowledge Graph embedding method using regularization. JOINER not only preserves co-occurrence between words in a text corpus and relations between entities in a Knowledge Graph, it also provides the flexibility to control the amount of information shared between the two data sources via regularization. Our method does not generate additional learning samples, which makes it computationally efficient. Our extensive empirical evaluation on real datasets shows the superiority of JOINER across different evaluation tasks, including analogical reasoning, link prediction, and relation extraction. Compared to state-of-the-art techniques generating additional learning samples from a set of anchors, our method yields better results (with up to 4.3% absolute improvement) and significantly less computational overhead (76% less learning time overhead).",

      "abstract": "Cardinality Estimation (CE) for query is to estimate the number of results without execution, which is an effective index in query optimization. Recently, CE for queries over knowlege graph (KGs) with triple facts has achieved great success. To more precisely represent facts, current researchers propose hyper-relational KGs (HKGs) to represent a triple fact with qualifiers providing additional context to the fact. However, existing CE methods, such as sampling and summary methods over KGs, perform unsatisfactorily on HKGs due to the complexity of qualifiers. Learning-based CE methods do not utilize qualifier information to learn query representation accurately, leading to poor performance. Also, there is only one limited CE benchmark for HKG query, which is not comprehensive and only covers limited patterns. The lack of querysets over HKG also becomes a bottleneck to comprehensively investigate CE problems on HKGs. In this work, we first construct diverse and unbiased hyper-relational querysets over three popular HKGs for investigating CE. Besides, we also propose a novel qualifier-aware graph neural network (GNN) model that effectively incorporates qualifier information and adaptively combines outputs from multiple GNN layers, to accurately predict the cardinality. Our experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms all state-of-the-art CE methods over three benchmarks on popular HKGs.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal knowledge graph embeddings (MKGE) have recently garnered significant attention. Unlike traditional unimodal knowledge graph embeddings, MKGE integrates both structural and multimodal knowledge to represent entities within a unified framework. However, real-world entities exhibit heterogeneity, often resulting in semantic inconsistencies where structurally similar embeddings may diverge significantly in their multimodal representations. Previous approaches primarily focus on directly fusing structural and multimodal embeddings, thus overlooking the issue of semantic-embedding inconsistency. To tackle this issue, we propose a new multimodal knowledge graph embedding method via Lorentz-based contrastive learning (LCKGE). we firstly introduce a well-designed nearest-neighbor fusion module via contrastive learning for multimodal fusion. Then, an attention-based Lorentz transformation is proposed for capturing more complex geometric information in MKGs. Furthermore, a series of comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. We provide the code and appendix of LCKGE in https://github.com/RuizhouLiu/LCKGE",

      "abstract": "Relation extraction (RE) aims to identify relations between entities mentioned in texts. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (ICL) abilities in various tasks, they still suffer from poor performances compared to most supervised fine-tuned RE methods. Utilizing ICL for RE with LLMs encounters two challenges: (1) retrieving good demonstrations from training examples, and (2) enabling LLMs exhibit strong ICL abilities in RE. On the one hand, retrieving good demonstrations is a non-trivial process in RE, which easily results in low relevance regarding entities and relations. On the other hand, ICL with an LLM achieves poor performance in RE while RE is different from language modeling in nature or the LLM is not large enough. In this work, we propose a novel recall-retrieve-reason RE framework that synergizes LLMs with retrieval corpora (training examples) to enable relevant retrieving and reliable in-context reasoning. Specifically, we distill the consistently ontological knowledge from training datasets to let LLMs generate relevant entity pairs grounded by retrieval corpora as valid queries. These entity pairs are then used to retrieve relevant training examples from the retrieval corpora as demonstrations for LLMs to conduct better ICL via instruction tuning. Extensive experiments on different LLMs and RE datasets demonstrate that our method generates relevant and valid entity pairs and boosts ICL abilities of LLMs, achieving competitive or new state-of-the-art performance on sentence-level RE compared to previous supervised fine-tuning methods and ICL-based methods.",

      "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have emerged as a leading approach for semi-supervised node classification. However, due to the uneven distribution of labeled nodes in graphs, only a limited subset of unlabeled nodes can directly access the labeled nodes. This disconnection between the labeled and unlabeled nodes significantly hinders GCNs performance. To address this challenge, we propose an Augmented Graph Convolutional Network for enhancing Labeled Reachability (AGCN-LR), which is designed to improve information flow to low-degree nodes by strengthening their connectivity with labeled nodes. The core of AGCN-LR comprises two parts. First, we selectively connect low-degree nodes to labeled nodes by calculating feature similarity and shortest path distances to generate augmented graphs, thereby enhancing label reachability. Second, we leverage GCNs to learn these augmented graphs and integrate embeddings from these graphs through an attention mechanism to bolster overall performance. Furthermore, to capture consistent information across augmented graphs, we incorporate a tailored contrastive loss function, facilitating consistent contextual learning across different augmented graphs. Experimental results demonstrate that AGCN-LR substantially enhances performance in semi-supervised node classification tasks across various benchmark datasets, exhibiting stronger advantages in sparse label and noisy graph scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Various methods embed knowledge graphs with the goal of predicting missing edges. Inference patterns are the logical relationships that occur in a graph. To make proper predictions, models trained by embedding methods must capture inference patterns. There are several theoretical analyses studying pattern-capturing capabilities. Unfortunately, these analyses are challenging and many embedding methods remain unstudied. Also, they do not quantify how accurately a pattern is captured in real-world datasets. Existing empirical studies have studied a small subset of simple inference patterns, and the analysis methods used have varied depending on the models evaluated. In this paper, we present a model-agnostic method to empirically quantify how patterns are captured by trained embedding models. We collect the most plausible predictions to form a new graph, and use it to globally assess pattern-capturing capabilities. For a given pattern, we study positive and negative evidence, i.e., edges that the pattern deems correct and incorrect based on the partial completeness assumption. As far as we know, it is the first time negative evidence is analyzed. Our experiments show that several models effectively capture the positive evidence of inference patterns. However, the performance is poor for negative evidence, which entails that models fail to learn the partial completeness assumption. We also identify new inference patterns not studied before. Surprisingly, models generally achieve better performance in these new patterns that we introduce.",

      "abstract": "Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) are an effective method for representing inter-entity and inter-event relationships in continuous time. The inference of temporal knowledge graphs refers to the completion of missing information for already existing points in time, and the extrapolation is the prediction of unknow-able facts occurring in the future, and these two kinds of reasoning have important practical value in various fields. However, in the reasoning of temporal knowledge graphs, the lack of capturing potential relationships between entities between dif-ferent times or within the same time when encoding local and global historical information has led to models that often perform poorly in the face of complex political events. To address these issues, this paper proposes a global-local latent relationship learning model for temporal knowledge graphs based on graph neural networks. Specifically, the model employs a latent relationship learning module to mine and exploit latent relationships within a time slice with multiple adjacent time slices to better simulate and interpret local and global historical information, enhancing the model's ability to deal with complex real-world event problems. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets show a 3 to 4 percentage point improvement in the model's inference capability compared to the state-of-the-art inference model.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs are more widely utilized to enhance recommendability and explainability. Reinforcement learning agents built to wander around the knowledge graph have been successfully applied in recommendation systems in a form of multi-hop relation reasoning. Some previous multi-hop methods relied on reinforcement learning of discrete actions, making agent space design challenging and a lack of clarity in the meaning of actions because of inconsistent action. To solve the aforementioned issues, we propose Continuous-action Walking-tendency Interest-oriented Path Reasoning (CWIPR), a novel and pioneering method that uses continuous actions provided by reinforcement learning agents to predict inference relations and the next entity. Meanwhile, to better interact with the knowledge graph through continuous actions, we firstly propose a graph search algorithm called the walking tendency algorithm. Moreover, we introduce an interest-oriented reward as the intrinsic reward that encourages the agent to balance the tendency between exploring the most similar entities and exploring the correct recommendation type to achieve more precise recommendations. We extensively evaluate our method on three real-world datasets from Amazon and obtain favorable performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

In this paper, we present the first PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for KGRL methods. To analyze a broad class of KGRL models, we propose a generic framework named ReED (Relation-aware Encoder-Decoder), which consists of a relation-aware message passing encoder and a triplet classification decoder. Our ReED framework can express at least 15 different existing KGRL models, including not only graph neural network-based models such as R-GCN and CompGCN but also shallow-architecture models such as RotatE and ANALOGY. Our generalization bounds for the ReED framework provide theoretical grounds for the commonly used tricks in KGRL, e.g., parameter-sharing and weight normalization schemes, and guide desirable design choices for practical KGRL methods. We empirically show that the critical factors in our generalization bounds can explain actual generalization errors on three real-world knowledge graphs.",

      "abstract": "Designing a proper scoring function is the key to ensuring the excellent performance of knowledge base (KB) embedding. Recently, the scoring function search method introduces the automated machine learning technique to design the data-aware scoring function for the given binary relational data (a.k.a. knowledge graph, KG), which can consistently achieve good performance on different data sets. However, the current data-aware search method is still not as good as desired. First, the existing model can only search scoring functions on the given binary relational data, which is a special form of N-ary relational KBs. Second, observing that existing scoring functions can exhibit distinct performance on different semantic patterns, we are motivated to explore such semantics by searching pattern-aware scoring functions. Unfortunately, it is hard to extend existing search approaches to the scenarios of N-ary and pattern-aware due to the search efficiency and effectiveness issues. In this paper, we propose latent-based factors to model relational patterns and an efficient search algorithm on the N-ary scenario, i.e., efficient LAtent-based SCOring function search for N-ary relational KBs (LASCO). The empirical results of LASCO on binary and N-ary relational data sets demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently search pattern-aware scoring functions and achieve better embedding performance than advanced baselines.",

      "abstract": "In the context of dynamic service ecosystems, the inability of conventional knowledge graph embedding (KGE) methods to efficiently update incremental knowledge poses a significant challenge for the effectiveness of intelligent web applications. To address the continuous updating challenges of service knowledge, this paper introduces MetaHG, a meta-learning strategy for KGE. Unlike existing meta-learning KGE studies that focus solely on local entity information, MetaHG incorporates both local and potential global structural information from current snapshot’s seen knowledge graphs (KGs) to mitigate issues such as spatial deformation and enhance the representation of unseen entities. Our approach initializes entity embeddings using ‘in’ and ‘out’ relationship matrices and refines them through a hybrid graph neural network (GNN) framework, which includes a GNN layer for local information and a hypergraph neural network (HGNN) layer for potential global information. The meta-learning strategy embedded in MetaHG effectively transfers meta-knowledge for the accurate representation of emerging entities. Extensive experiments are conducted on a self-collected clothing industry service dataset and two publicly available open-source KG datasets. By comparing with several baselines, experiment results demonstrate the superior performance of MetaHG in generating high-quality embeddings for emerging entities and dynamically updating service knowledge.",

      "abstract": "Basically, a Knowledge Graph (KG) is a graph variant that represents data via triplets comprising a head, a tail, and a relation. Realistically, most KGs are compiled either manually or semi-automatically, and this usually results in a significant loss of vital information with respect to the KG. Thus, this problem of incompleteness is common to virtually all KGs; and it is formally defined as Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) problem. In this paper, we have explored learning the representations of a KGs with regard to its entities and relations for the purpose of any predicting missing link(s). In that regard, this paper proposes a hybrid variant, composed of TransE and SimplE models, for solving KGC problems. On one hand, the TransE model depicts a relation as the translation from the source entity (head) to the target entity (tail) within an embedding space. In TransE, the head and tail entities are derived from the same embedding-generation class, which results in a low prediction score. Also, the TransE model is not able to capture symmetric relationships as well as one-to-many relationships. On the other hand, the SimplE model is based on Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition. SimplE enhances CP via the addition of the inverse relation, while the head entity and tail entity are derived from different embedding-generation classes which are interdependent. Hence, we employed the principle of inverse-relation embedding (from the SimplE model) onto the native TransE model so as to yield a new hybrid resultant: HTransE. Therefore, HTransE boasts of efficiency as well as improved prediction scores. Efficiently, HTransE converges much quicker in comparison to TransE. In other words, HTransE converges at approximately $n/2$ iterations where $n$ denotes the iterations required to fully train TransE. Our results outperform the native TransE approach with a significant difference. Also, HTransE outperforms several state-of-the-art models on different datasets.",

      "abstract": "In maritime logistics optimization, considerable research efforts are focused on the extraction of deep behavioral characteristics from comprehensive shipping data to discern patterns in maritime vessel behavior. The effective linkage of these characteristics with maritime infrastructure, such as berths, is critical for the enhancement of ship navigation systems. This endeavor is paramount not only as a research focus within maritime information science but also for the progression of intelligent maritime systems. Traditional methodologies have primarily emphasized the analysis of navigational paths of vessels without an extensive consideration of the geographical dynamics between ships and port infrastructure. However, the introduction of knowledge graphs has enabled the integration of disparate data sources, facilitating new insights that propel the development of intelligent maritime systems. This manuscript presents a novel framework using knowledge graph technology for profound analysis of maritime data. Utilizing automatic identification system (AIS) data alongside spatial information from port facilities, the framework forms semantic triplet connections among ships, anchorages, berths, and waterways. This enables the semantic modeling of maritime behaviors, offering precise identification of ships through their diverse semantic information. Moreover, by exploiting the semantic relations between ships and berths, a reverse semantic knowledge graph for berths is constructed, which is specifically tailored to ship type, size, and category. The manuscript critically evaluates a range of graph embedding techniques, dimensionality reduction methods, and classification strategies through experimental frameworks to determine the most efficacious methodologies. The findings reveal that the maritime knowledge graph significantly enhances the semantic understanding of unmanned maritime equipment, thereby improving decision-making capabilities. Additionally, it establishes a semantic foundation for the development of expansive maritime models, illustrating the potential of knowledge graph technology in advancing intelligent maritime systems.",

      "abstract": "Data sparsity is a problem faced by most recommendation systems. Sequence recommendation is a recommendation method to predict user preferences based on user behavior sequence. There is also the problem of data sparsity. User behavior sequences are scattered in different fields, and user interests are related in different fields. User behavior sequence data in some fields are very sparse, and user behavior sequence data in some fields are relatively dense. From a single domain, when the user behavior sequence data is sparse, the user preference model can not be accurately constructed based on the user behavior sequence. In order to solve this problem, starting from the relevance of domain user interests, this paper migrates the user preference information of related domains to build the user preference model of the target domain, and proposes a sequence recommendation method based on cross domain user preference migration. Firstly, this paper studies the feasibility of knowledge map guiding preference migration, constructs cross domain knowledge map according to the connection relationship between items in different fields, and embeds the relationship path between items into item representation, so that the relationship path can guide user preference migration between different fields. Then, the domain preference distribution and general preference distribution are established. The MMD distance is used to align the general preference distribution, and the anti transfer learning is used to align the domain preference distribution and general preference distribution. According to the user’s general preference distribution in the source domain, the user’s preference model in the target domain is constructed. Finally, experiments verify the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed model.",

      "abstract": "Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) reasoning involves predicting future facts based on historical information by learning correlations between entities and relations. Recently, many models have been proposed for the TKG reasoning task. However, most existing models cannot efficiently utilize historical information, which can be summarized in two aspects: 1) Many models only consider the historical information in a fixed time range, resulting in a lack of useful information; 2) some models use all the historical facts, thus some noise or invalid facts are introduced during reasoning. In this regard, we propose a novel TKG reasoning model with dynamic memory enhancement (DyMemR). Inspired by human memory, we introduce memory capacity, memory loss, and repetition stimulation to design a human-like memory pool that could remember potentially useful historical facts. To fully leverage the memory pool, we utilize a two-stage training strategy. The first stage is guided by the memory-based encoding module which learns embeddings from memory-based subgraphs generated through the memory pool. The second stage is the memory-based scoring module that emphasizes the historical facts in the memory pool. Finally, we extensively validate the superiority of DyMemR against various state-of-the-art baselines.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Embedding models, representing entities and edges in a low-dimensional space, have been extremely successful at solving tasks related to completing and exploring Knowledge Graphs (KGs). One of the key aspects of training most of these models is teaching to discriminate between true statements positives and false ones (negatives). However, the way in which negatives can be defined is not trivial, as facts missing from the KG are not necessarily false and a set of ground truth negatives is hardly ever given. This makes synthetic negative generation a necessity. Different generation strategies can heavily affect the quality of the embeddings, making it a primary aspect to consider. We revamp a strategy that generates corruptions during training respecting the domain and range of relations, we extend its capabilities and we show our methods bring substantial improvement (+10% MRR) for standard benchmark datasets and over +150% MRR for a larger ontology-backed dataset.",

      "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) completion models typically rely on having access to the entire graph during training. However, in real-world scenarios, TKG data is often received incrementally as events unfold, leading to a dynamic non-stationary data distribution over time. While one could incorporate fine-tuning to existing methods to allow them to adapt to evolving TKG data, this can lead to forgetting previously learned patterns. Alternatively, retraining the model with the entire updated TKG can mitigate forgetting but is computationally burdensome. To address these challenges, we propose a general continual training framework that is applicable to any TKG completion method, and leverages two key ideas: (i) a temporal regularization that encourages repurposing of less important model parameters for learning new knowledge, and (ii) a clustering-based experience replay that reinforces the past knowledge by selectively preserving only a small portion of the past data. Our experimental results on widely used event-centric TKG datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed continual training framework in adapting to new events while reducing catastrophic forgetting. Further, we perform ablation studies to show the effectiveness of each component of our proposed framework. Finally, we investigate the relation between the memory dedicated to experience replay and the benefit gained from our clustering-based sampling strategy.",

      "abstract": "Although the state-of-the-art traditional representation learning (TRL) models show competitive performance on knowledge graph completion, there is no parameter sharing between the embeddings of entities, and the connections between entities are weak. Therefore, neighbor aggregation-based representation learning (NARL) models are proposed, which encode the information in the neighbors of an entity into its embeddings. However, existing NARL models either only utilize one-hop neighbors, ignoring the information in multi-hop neighbors, or utilize multi-hop neighbors by hierarchical neighbor aggregation, destroying the completeness of multi-hop neighbors. In this paper, we propose a NARL model named RMNA, which obtains and filters horn rules through a rule mining algorithm, and uses selected horn rules to transform valuable multi-hop neighbors into one-hop neighbors, therefore, the information in valuable multi-hop neighbors can be completely utilized by aggregating these one-hop neighbors. In experiments, we compare RMNA with the state-of-the-art TRL models and NARL models. The results show that RMNA has a competitive performance.",

      "abstract": "Traditional knowledge graph (KG) embedding methods aim to represent entities and relations in a low-dimensional space, primarily focusing on static graphs. However, real-world KGs are dynamically evolving with the constant addition of entities, relations and facts. To address such dynamic nature of KGs, several continual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) methods have been developed to efficiently update KG embeddings to accommodate new facts while maintaining learned knowledge. As KGs grow at different rates and scales in real-world scenarios, existing CKGE methods often fail to consider the varying scales of updates and lack systematic evaluation throughout the entire update process. In this paper, we propose SAGE, a scale-aware gradual evolution framework for CKGE. Specifically, SAGE firstly determine the embedding dimensions based on the update scales and expand the embedding space accordingly. The Dynamic Distillation mechanism is further employed to balance the preservation of learned knowledge and the incorporation of new facts. We conduct extensive experiments on seven benchmarks, and the results show that SAGE consistently outperforms existing baselines, with a notable improvement of 1.38% in MRR, 1.25% in H@1 and 1.6% in H@10. Furthermore, experiments comparing SAGE with methods using fixed embedding dimensions show that SAGE achieves optimal performance on every snapshot, demonstrating the importance of adaptive embedding dimensions in CKGE.

      "abstract": "Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) owe their success to pre-training language models on large amounts of unstructured data. Still, there is an increasing effort to combine the unstructured nature of LMs with structured knowledge and reasoning. Particularly in the rapidly evolving field of biomedical NLP, knowledge-enhanced language models (KELMs) have emerged as promising tools to bridge the gap between large language models and domain-specific knowledge, considering the available biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) curated by experts over the decades. In this paper, we develop an approach that uses lightweight adapter modules to inject structured biomedical knowledge into pre-trained language models (PLMs). We use two large KGs, the biomedical knowledge system UMLS and the novel biochemical ontology OntoChem, with two prominent biomedical PLMs, PubMedBERT and BioLinkBERT. The approach includes partitioning knowledge graphs into smaller subgraphs, fine-tuning adapter modules for each subgraph, and combining the knowledge in a fusion layer. We test the performance on three downstream tasks: document classification,question answering, and natural language inference. We show that our methodology leads to performance improvements in several instances while keeping requirements in computing power low. Finally, we provide a detailed interpretation of the results and report valuable insights for future work.",

      "abstract": "With the rapid development of intelligent transportation systems, in-vehicle edge computing networks serve as key infrastructures to provide strong support for vehicle communication and coordination. However, the traditional resource allocation methods face many challenges due to the changing network topology, the uncertainty of data load, and the spatio-temporal relationship between traveling vehicles. Therefore, in this paper, a meta-learning based resource allocation algorithm is designed to overcome these problems. By introducing meta-learning, the aim is to enable the system to quickly adapt to different scenarios and requirements so as to improve the resource utilization. The algorithm not only fully considers the network performance index, but also comprehensively solves the real-time and reliability requirements to achieve comprehensive optimization. The resource allocation algorithm based on meta-learning designed in this paper simulates different car networking tasks during the training process, so that the network learns a more robust resource allocation strategy, which not only fully takes into account the network performance index, but also comprehensively solves the real-time and reliability requirements and achieves comprehensive optimization. Through a large number of simulation experiments and comparisons in Telematics, the algorithm proposed in this paper outperforms the current state-of-the-art algorithms by 20% in terms of request acceptance rate, and leads by 15% in terms of overall gain. The experimental results show that the algorithm in this paper outperforms the current state-of-the-art algorithms in solving the resource allocation problem for car networking applications in edge computing networks.",

      "abstract": "Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding (CKGE) aims to efficiently learn new knowledge and simultaneously preserve old knowledge. Dominant approaches primarily focus on alleviating catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge but neglect efficient learning for the emergence of new knowledge. However, in real-world scenarios, knowledge graphs (KGs) are continuously growing, which brings a significant challenge to fine-tuning KGE models efficiently. To address this issue, we propose a fast CKGE framework (FastKGE), incorporating an incremental low-rank adapter (IncLoRA) mechanism to efficiently acquire new knowledge while preserving old knowledge. Specifically, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, FastKGE isolates and allocates new knowledge to specific layers based on the fine-grained influence between old and new KGs. Subsequently, to accelerate fine-tuning, FastKGE devises an efficient IncLoRA mechanism, which embeds the specific layers into incremental low-rank adapters with fewer training parameters. Moreover, IncLoRA introduces adaptive rank allocation, which makes the LoRA aware of the importance of entities and adjusts its rank scale adaptively. We conduct experiments on four public datasets and two new datasets with a larger initial scale. Experimental results demonstrate that FastKGE can reduce training time by 34%-49% while still achieving competitive link prediction performance against state-of-the-art models on four public datasets (average MRR score of 21.0% vs. 21.1%). Meanwhile, on two newly constructed datasets, FastKGE saves 51%-68% training time and improves link prediction performance by 1.5%.",

      "abstract": "This review provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art methods of graph-based networks from a deep learning perspective. Graph networks provide a generalized form to exploit non-euclidean space data. A graph can be visualized as an aggregation of nodes and edges without having any order. Data-driven architecture tends to follow a fixed neural network trying to find the pattern in feature space. These strategies have successfully been applied to many applications for euclidean space data. Since graph data in a non-euclidean space does not follow any kind of order, these solutions can be applied to exploit the node relationships. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) solve this problem by exploiting the relationships among graph data. Recent developments in computational hardware and optimization allow graph networks possible to learn the complex graph relationships. Graph networks are therefore being actively used to solve many problems including protein interface, classification, and learning representations of fingerprints. To encapsulate the importance of graph models, in this paper, we formulate a systematic categorization of GNN models according to their applications from theory to real-life problems and provide a direction of the future scope for the applications of graph models as well as highlight the limitations of existing graph networks.",

      "abstract": "Background Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) can result in unexpected pharmacological outcomes, including adverse drug events, which are crucial for drug discovery. Graph neural networks have substantially advanced our ability to model molecular representations; however, the precise identification of key local structures and the capture of long-distance structural correlations for better DDI prediction and interpretation remain significant challenges. Results Here, we present DrugDAGT, a dual-attention graph transformer framework with contrastive learning for predicting multiple DDI types. The dual-attention graph transformer incorporates attention mechanisms at both the bond and atomic levels, thereby enabling the integration of short and long-range dependencies within drug molecules to pinpoint key local structures essential for DDI discovery. Moreover, DrugDAGT further implements graph contrastive learning to maximize the similarity of representations across different views for better discrimination of molecular structures. Experiments in both warm-start and cold-start scenarios demonstrate that DrugDAGT outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models, achieving superior overall performance. Furthermore, visualization of the learned representations of drug pairs and the attention map provides interpretable insights instead of black-box results. Conclusions DrugDAGT provides an effective tool for accurately predicting multiple DDI types by identifying key local chemical structures, offering valuable insights for prescribing medications, and guiding drug development.

      "abstract": "While deep-learning-enabled recommender systems demonstrate strong performance benchmarks, many struggle to adapt effectively in real-world environments due to limited use of user-item relationship data and insufficient transparency in recommendation generation. Traditional collaborative filtering approaches fail to integrate multifaceted item attributes, and although Factorization Machines account for item-specific details, they overlook broader relational patterns. Collaborative knowledge graph-based models have progressed by embedding user-item interactions with item-attribute relationships, offering a holistic perspective on interconnected entities. However, these models frequently aggregate attribute and interaction data in an implicit manner, leaving valuable relational nuances underutilized.This study introduces the Knowledge Graph Attention Network with Information Fusion (KGIF), a specialized framework designed to merge entity and relation embeddings explicitly through a tailored self-attention mechanism. The KGIF framework integrates reparameterization via dynamic projection vectors, enabling embeddings to adaptively represent intricate relationships within knowledge graphs. This explicit fusion enhances the interplay between user-item interactions and item-attribute relationships, providing a nuanced balance between user-centric and item-centric representations. An attentive propagation mechanism further optimizes knowledge graph embeddings, capturing multi-layered interaction patterns. The contributions of this work include an innovative method for explicit information fusion, improved robustness for sparse knowledge graphs, and the ability to generate explainable recommendations through interpretable path visualization.

Nonetheless, it remains challenging to transfer the success of these architectures to relational hypergraphs, where the task of link prediction is over $k$-ary relations, which is substantially harder than link prediction with knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose a framework for link prediction with relational hypergraphs, unlocking applications of graph neural networks to fully relational structures. Theoretically, we conduct a thorough analysis of the expressive power of the resulting model architectures via corresponding relational Weisfeiler-Leman algorithms and also via logical expressiveness.

      "abstract": "The task of discovering equivalent entities in knowledge graphs (KGs), so-called KG entity alignment, has drawn much attention to overcome the incompleteness problem of KGs. The majority of existing techniques learns the pointwise representations of entities in the Euclidean space with translation assumption and graph neural network approaches. However, real vectors inherently neglect the complex relation structures and lack the expressiveness of embeddings; hence, they may guide the embeddings to be falsely generated which results in alignment performance degradation. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel KG alignment framework, ComplexGCN, which learns the embeddings of both entities and relations in complex spaces while capturing both semantic and neighborhood information simultaneously. The proposed model ensures richer expressiveness and more accurate embeddings by successfully capturing various relation structures in complex spaces with high-level computation. The model further incorporates relation label and direction information with a low degree of freedom. To compare our proposal against the state-of-the-art baseline techniques, we conducted extensive experiments on real-world datasets. The empirical results show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Reasoning over knowledge graphs (KGs) has received increasing attention recently due to its promising applications in many areas, such as semantic search and recommendation systems. Subsequently, most reasoning models are inherently transductive and ignore uncertainties of KGs, making it difficult to generalize to unseen entities. Moreover, existing approaches usually require each entity in the KG to have sufficient training samples, which leads to the overfitting of the entity having few instances. In fact, long-tail distributions are quite widespread in KGs, and newly emerging entities will tend to have only a few related triples. In this work, we aim at studying knowledge graph reasoning under a challenging setting where only limited training samples are available. Specifically, we propose a Bayesian inductive reasoning method and incorporate meta-learning techniques in few-shot learning to solve data deficiency and uncertainties. We design a Bayesian graph neural network as a meta-learner to achieve Bayesian inference, which can extrapolate meta-knowledge from observed KG to emerging entities. We conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate considerable performance improvement with the proposed approach over other baselines.",

      "abstract": "Multi-modal entity alignment aims to identify entities that refer to the same concept in the real world across a plethora of multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs). Most existing methods focus on reducing the embedding differences between multiple modalities while neglecting the following challenges: 1) cannot handle the heterogeneity across graphs, 2) suffer from the scarcity of pre-aligned data (a.k.a. initial seeds). To tackle these issues, we propose a Pseudo-Siamese Network for multi-modal Entity Alignment (PSNEA). It consists of two modules to extract various information and generate holistic embeddings. Specifically, the first module PSN is designed with two parallel branches to learn the representations for different MMKGs, thus effectively bridging the graph heterogeneity. On top of this, we introduce an Incremental Alignment Pool (IAP) to alleviate the scarcity of initial seeds by labeling likely alignment. IAP avoids error-prone by data swapping and sample re-weighting strategies. To the best of our knowledge, PSNEA is the first model that tackles graph heterogeneity and scarcity of initial seeds in one unified framework. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves the best performance on both cross-lingual and cross-graph datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/idrfer/psn4ea.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, knowledge graph technology has been widely applied in various fields such as intelligent auditing, urban transportation planning, legal research, and financial analysis. In traditional auditing methods, there are inefficiencies in data integration and analysis, making it difficult to achieve deep correlation analysis and risk identification among data. Additionally, decision support systems in the auditing process may face issues of insufficient information interpretability and limited predictive capability, thus affecting the quality of auditing and the scientificity of decision-making. However, knowledge graphs, by constructing rich networks of entity relationships, provide deep knowledge support for areas such as intelligent search, recommendation systems, and semantic understanding, significantly improving the accuracy and efficiency of information processing. This presents new opportunities to address the challenges of traditional auditing techniques. In this paper, we investigate the integration of intelligent auditing and knowledge graphs, focusing on the application of knowledge graph technology in auditing work for power engineering projects. We particularly emphasize mainstream key technologies of knowledge graphs, such as data extraction, knowledge fusion, and knowledge graph reasoning. We also introduce the application of knowledge graph technology in intelligent auditing, such as improving auditing efficiency and identifying auditing risks. Furthermore, considering the environment of cloud-edge collaboration to reduce computing latency, knowledge graphs can also play an important role in intelligent auditing. By integrating knowledge graph technology with cloud-edge collaboration, distributed computing and data processing can be achieved, reducing computing latency and improving the response speed and efficiency of intelligent auditing systems. Finally, we summarize the current research status, outlining the challenges faced by knowledge graph technology in the field of intelligent auditing, such as scalability and security. At the same time, we elaborate on the future development trends and opportunities of knowledge graphs in intelligent auditing.",

      "abstract": "Few-shot Relational Triple Extraction (FRTE) task aims to extract new relational triples from unstructured text with limited labeled samples. Recently, FRTE approaches prefer the relation-then-entity paradigm to avoid the entity discrepancy problem and the tag explosion problem suffered by entity-then-relation paradigm and unified paradigm, respectively. Although the relation-then-entity approaches becomes mainstream, they ignore an important problem that is the error transmission from the upstream relation extraction process to the downstream entity identification process. To solve the problem, we propose a novel Relation Candidate-guided few-shot relational Triple Extraction approach, namely RCTE. It adopts relation-then-entity paradigm and based on gate mechanism and beam search framework. We design a gate mechanism. Then we provide a beam search framework to identify entities for each relation candidate and select the relational triple with the largest joint prediction probability as the final predicted result, alleviating the error transmission by augmenting relation candidates and comprehensively measuring prediction probabilities of two extraction subprocesses. The experiments on the FewRel dataset verify the validity, rationality and generalization of our method, and it achieves 45.28% and 41.87% micro F1 score in the 5-way-5-shot and 10-way-10-shot tasks, respectively, the results show that it achieves grate performance compared to other baseline models.",

      "abstract": "Much of the world's most valued data is stored in relational databases and data warehouses, where the data is organized into many tables connected by primary-foreign key relations. However, building machine learning models using this data is both challenging and time consuming. The core problem is that no machine learning method is capable of learning on multiple tables interconnected by primary-foreign key relations. Current methods can only learn from a single table, so the data must first be manually joined and aggregated into a single training table, the process known as feature engineering. Feature engineering is slow, error prone and leads to suboptimal models. Here we introduce an end-to-end deep representation learning approach to directly learn on data laid out across multiple tables. We name our approach Relational Deep Learning (RDL). The core idea is to view relational databases as a temporal, heterogeneous graph, with a node for each row in each table, and edges specified by primary-foreign key links. Message Passing Graph Neural Networks can then automatically learn across the graph to extract representations that leverage all input data, without any manual feature engineering. Relational Deep Learning leads to more accurate models that can be built much faster. To facilitate research in this area, we develop RelBench, a set of benchmark datasets and an implementation of Relational Deep Learning. The data covers a wide spectrum, from discussions on Stack Exchange to book reviews on the Amazon Product Catalog. Overall, we define a new research area that generalizes graph machine learning and broadens its applicability to a wide set of AI use cases.",

      "abstract": "To solve control problems via model-based reasoning or planning, an agent needs to know how its actions affect the state of the world. The actions an agent has at its disposal often change the state of the environment in systematic ways. However, existing techniques for world modelling do not guarantee that the effect of actions are represented in such systematic ways. We introduce the Parsimonious Latent Space Model (PLSM), a world model that regularizes the latent dynamics to make the effect of the agent's actions more predictable. Our approach minimizes the mutual information between latent states and the change that an action produces in the agent's latent state, in turn minimizing the dependence the state has on the dynamics. This makes the world model softly state-invariant. We combine PLSM with different model classes used for i) future latent state prediction, ii) planning, and iii) model-free reinforcement learning. We find that our regularization improves accuracy, generalization, and performance in downstream tasks, highlighting the importance of systematic treatment of actions in world models.",

Nevertheless, Temporal KG (TKG) reasoning, which is to forecast future facts, still faces with a dilemma due to the complex interactions between entities over time. This article proposes a novel intricate Spatiotemporal Dependency learning Network (STDN) based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to capture the underlying correlations of an entity at different timestamps. Specifically, we first learn an adaptive adjacency matrix to depict the direct dependencies from the temporally adjacent facts of an entity, obtaining its previous context embedding. Then, a Spatiotemporal feature Encoding GCN (STE-GCN) is proposed to capture the latent spatiotemporal dependencies of the entity, getting the spatiotemporal embedding. Finally, a time gate unit is used to integrate the previous context embedding and the spatiotemporal embedding at the current timestamp to update the entity evolutional embedding for predicting future facts. STDN could generate the more expressive embeddings for capturing the intricate spatiotemporal dependencies in TKG. Extensive experiments on WIKI, ICEWS14, and ICEWS18 datasets prove our STDN has the advantage over state-of-the-art baselines for the temporal reasoning task.",

      "abstract": "With the overwhelming popularity of Knowledge Graphs (KGs), researchers have poured attention to link prediction to fill in missing facts for a long time. However, they mainly focus on link prediction on binary relational data, where facts are usually represented as triples in the form of (head entity, relation, tail entity). In practice, n-ary relational facts are also ubiquitous. When encountering such facts, existing studies usually decompose them into triples by introducing a multitude of auxiliary virtual entities and additional triples. These conversions result in the complexity of carrying out link prediction on n-ary relational data. It has even proven that they may cause loss of structure information. To overcome these problems, in this paper, we represent each n-ary relational fact as a set of its role and role-value pairs. We then propose a method called NaLP to conduct link prediction on n-ary relational data, which explicitly models the relatedness of all the role and role-value pairs in an n-ary relational fact. We further extend NaLP by introducing type constraints of roles and role-values without any external type-specific supervision, and proposing a more reasonable negative sampling mechanism. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed methods.",

Our approach is based on the intuition that is the basis of neuro-symbolic AI systems: to combine deep learning and symbolic reasoning in one single model, in order to take the best out of both the paradigms. To this end, we start from a knowledge graph (KG) encoding information about users, ratings, and descriptive properties of the items and we design a model that combines background knowledge encoded in logical rules mined from the KG with explicit knowledge encoded in the triples of the KG itself to obtain a more precise representation of users and items. Specifically, our model is based on the combination of: (i) a rule learner that extracts first-order logic rules based on the information encoded in the knowledge graph; (ii) a graph embedding module, that jointly learns a vector space representation of users and items based on the triples encoded in the knowledge graph and the rules previously extracted; (iii) a recommendation module that uses the embeddings to feed a deep learning architecture that provides users with top-k recommendations. In the experimental section, we evaluate the effectiveness of our strategy on three datasets, and the results show that the combination of knowledge graph embeddings and first-order logic rules led to an improvement in the predictive accuracy and in the novelty of the recommendations.

Previous works have demonstrated that KGs are prone to various social biases, and have proposed multiple methods for debiasing them. However, in such studies, the focus has been on debiasing techniques, while the relations to be debiased are specified manually by the user. As manual specification is itself susceptible to human cognitive bias, there is a need for a system capable of quantifying and exposing biases, that can support more informed decisions on what to debias. To address this gap in the literature, we describe a framework for identifying biases present in knowledge graph embeddings, based on numerical bias metrics. We illustrate the framework with three different bias measures on the task of profession prediction, and it can be flexibly extended to further bias definitions and applications. The relations flagged as biased can then be handed to decision makers for judgement upon subsequent debiasing.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) plays an important role in graph mining and learning applications by converting discrete graph structures to continuous vector representations. While previous systems have focused on scaling KGE onto multiple GPUs, the score function computation on each GPU can be a performance bottleneck. Existing KGE systems implement the score functions with separate tensor operations, leading to large memory consumption and poor memory access efficiency. To overcome the issues, we propose a code generator that automatically translates Python-like definitions of KGE score functions into efficient CUDA code. Our code generator exploits the unique feature of KGE score functions and performs an aggressive fusion of tensor operations. Additionally, our generated code performs a runtime inspection to reduce redundant memory access for edges with identical indices. Experiments show that our generated code uses much less memory than previous systems and achieves an average speedup of 14.9x over TorchScript and 7.8x over TVM.",

      "abstract": "Most sequential recommendation systems (SRSs) predict the next item as the target for users given its preceding items as input, assuming the target is definitely related to its input. However, users may unintentionally click items that are inconsistent with their preference due to external factors, causing unreliable instances whose target mismatches the input. We, for the first time, verify SRSs can be misguided by such unreliable instances and design a generic SRS framework By Eliminating unReliable Data (BERD+), which can be flexibly plugged into existing SRSs. Specifically, BRED+ is guided with observations on the training process of instances: Unreliable instances generally have high training loss; high-loss instances are not necessarily unreliable but uncertain ones caused by blurry sequential patterns; and item attributes help rectify instance loss and uncertainty, but may also introduce disturbance. Accordingly, BERD+ models both the loss and uncertainty of each instance via a Gaussian distribution, whereby a heterogeneous uncertainty-aware graph convolution network is designed to learn accurate embeddings for different entities while reducing the disturbance caused by uncertain attribute values. Thereafter, an explicit preference extractor rectifies instance loss and uncertainty and reduces the disturbance caused by less-focused attribute types. Finally, instances with high loss and low uncertainty are eliminated as unreliable data. Extensive experiments verify the efficacy of BERD+.",

      "abstract": "Background Knowledge graphs (KGs) can integrate domain knowledge into a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) intelligent syndrome differentiation model. However, the quality of current KGs in the TCM domain varies greatly, related to the lack of knowledge graph completion (KGC) and evaluation methods. Objective This study aims to investigate KGC and evaluation methods tailored for TCM domain knowledge. Methods In the KGC phase, according to the characteristics of TCM domain knowledge, we proposed a 3-step “entity-ontology-path” completion approach. This approach uses path reasoning, ontology rule reasoning, and association rules. In the KGC quality evaluation phase, we proposed a 3-dimensional evaluation framework that encompasses completeness, accuracy, and usability, using quantitative metrics such as complex network analysis, ontology reasoning, and graph representation. Furthermore, we compared the impact of different graph representation models on KG usability. Results In the KGC phase, 52, 107, 27, and 479 triples were added by outlier analysis, rule-based reasoning, association rules, and path-based reasoning, respectively. In addition, rule-based reasoning identified 14 contradictory triples. In the KGC quality evaluation phase, in terms of completeness, KG had higher density and lower sparsity after completion, and there were no contradictory rules within the KG. In terms of accuracy, KG after completion was more consistent with prior knowledge. In terms of usability, the mean reciprocal ranking, mean rank, and hit rate of the first N tail entities predicted by the model (Hits@N) of the TransE, RotatE, DistMult, and ComplEx graph representation models all showed improvement after KGC. Among them, the RotatE model achieved the best representation. Conclusions The 3-step completion approach can effectively improve the completeness, accuracy, and availability of KGs, and the 3-dimensional evaluation framework can be used for comprehensive KGC evaluation. In the TCM field, the RotatE model performed better at KG representation.",

      "abstract": "In the last few years, the solution to Knowledge Graph (KG) completion via learning embeddings of entities and relations has attracted a surge of interest. Temporal KGs(TKGs) extend traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) by associating static triples with timestamps forming quadruples. Different from KGs and TKGs in the transductive setting, constantly emerging entities and relations in incomplete TKGs create demand to predict missing facts with unseen components, which is the extrapolation setting. Traditional temporal knowledge graph embedding (TKGE) methods are limited in the extrapolation setting since they are trained within a fixed set of components. In this paper, we propose a Meta-Learning based Temporal Knowledge Graph Extrapolation (MTKGE) model, which is trained on link prediction tasks sampled from the existing TKGs and tested in the emerging TKGs with unseen entities and relations. Specifically, we meta-train a GNN framework that captures relative position patterns and temporal sequence patterns between relations. The learned embeddings of patterns can be transferred to embed unseen components. Experimental results on two different TKG extrapolation datasets show that MTKGE consistently outperforms both the existing state-of-the-art models for knowledge graph extrapolation and specifically adapted KGE and TKGE baselines.",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the most vulnerable malignant tumors for women in the world, which seriously threatens women's life and health. Fortunately, through timely screening, early breast cancer patients have a high cure rate, which is expected to reach complete recovery. Ultrasound imaging is a screening technology for breast cancer that is superior to the pathological judgment of puncture. It is less harmful to the patient and has the advantages of easy operation and real-time, so it is currently widely used. In order to alleviate the shortage of medical resources and improve screening efficiency, the technology of the breast cancer computer-aided diagnosis system came into being. This paper proposes a new and interpretable fully automated breast ultrasound computer-aided diagnosis method, which can automatically extract the corresponding medical features used by doctors after inputting an ultrasound image and infer the final diagnosis result through the knowledge association between these features. First, the input ultrasound image is read intelligently, similar to the reading process of ultrasound doctors. The diagnostic system extracts medical features useful for diagnosis from the ultrasound image. The second step is associating the extracted features with the known breast benign and malignant diagnosis knowledge graph and finally determining the benign and malignant tumor in this ultrasound image through the correlation relationship in the knowledge graph which is presented as a knowledge tensor. The experimental results show that the fully automated breast ultrasound CAD system proposed in this paper can realize the tradeoff between interpretability and accuracy.",

      "abstract": "All along, KG completion relied on link prediction has always been the focus of researchers. However, overwhelming majority of them can only serve 2-ary KGs. While in practice, knowledge hypergraphs (KH) covering facts beyond binary relations are far more ubiquitous. When confronted with them, massive studies for KGs show inadaptability. The several work towards N-ary KHs generally simply extend KG methods. And they usually transform N-ary knowledge into role-value pairs or triples, largely simplifying inherent association within each piece of knowledge. Furthermore, previous models study each N-ary knowledge independently, resulting in structural correlations among them being completely neglected. Motivated by these, avoiding breaking knowledge structure in KHs like previous studies do, we propose the first KH reasoning model based on original knowledge formats, RHKH. Challenged by complicated compositions indicated by the original format of N-ary tuples, association within and among each tuple is discovered through an innovative relational hypergraph neural network, RHNN. It considers complex interactions between relation and entities involved in the same knowledge as well. To refine such interactions, semantic components at each arity-position of relations are distinguished, along with introducing position-specific shift. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RHKH.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) serve as a crucial resource for numerous artificial intelligence tasks, significantly contributing to the advancement of the AI field. However, the incompleteness of existing KGs hinders their effectiveness in practical applications. Consequently, researchers have proposed the task of KG completion. Currently, embedding-based techniques dominate the field as they leverage the structural information within KGs to infer and complete missing parts. Nonetheless, these methods exhibit limitations. They are limited by the quality and quantity of structural information and are unable to handle the missing entities in the original KG. To overcome these challenges, researchers have attempted to integrate pretrained language models and textual data to perform KG completion. This approach utilizes the definition statements and description text of entities within KGs. The goal is to compensate for the latent connections that are difficult for traditional methods to obtain. However, text-based methods still lag behind embedding-based models in terms of performance. Our analysis reveals that the critical issue lies in the selection process of negative samples. In order to enhance the performance of the text-based methods, various types of negative sampling methods are employed in this study. We introduced prompt learning to fill the gap between the pre-training language model and the knowledge graph completion task, and to improve the model reasoning level. Simultaneously, a ranking strategy based on KG structural information is proposed to utilize KG structured data to assist reasoning. The experiment results demonstrate that our model exhibits strong competitiveness and outstanding inference speed. By fully exploiting the internal structural information of KGs and external relevant descriptive text resources, we successfully elevate the performance levels of KG completion tasks across various metrics.",

      "abstract": "Imagine having a knowledge graph that can extract medical health knowledge related to patient diagnosis solutions and treatments from thousands of research papers, distilled using machine learning techniques in healthcare applications. Medical doctors can quickly determine treatments and medications for urgent patients, while researchers can discover innovative treatments for existing and unknown diseases. This would be incredible! Our approach serves as an all-in-one solution, enabling users to employ a unified design methodology for creating their own knowledge graphs. Our rigorous validation process involves multiple stages of refinement, ensuring that the resulting answers are of the utmost professionalism and solidity, surpassing the capabilities of other solutions. However, building a high-quality knowledge graph from scratch, with complete triplets consisting of subject entities, relations, and object entities, is a complex and important task that requires a systematic approach. To address this, we have developed a comprehensive design flow for knowledge graph development and a high-quality entities database. We also developed knowledge distillation schemes that allow you to input a keyword (entity) and display all related entities and relations. Our proprietary methodology, multiple levels refinement (MLR), is a novel approach to constructing knowledge graphs and refining entities level-by-level. This ensures the generation of high-quality triplets and a readable knowledge graph through keyword searching. We have generated multiple knowledge graphs and developed a scheme to find the corresponding inputs and outputs of entity linking. Entities with multiple inputs and outputs are referred to as joints, and we have created a joint-version knowledge graph based on this. Additionally, we developed an interactive knowledge graph, providing a user-friendly environment for medical professionals to explore entities related to existing or unknown treatments/diseases.

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding aims to transform the entities and relations of triplets into the low-dimensional vectors. Previous methods are oriented towards the static knowledge graphs, in which all entities and relations are assumed to be known and only some unknown triplets need to be predicted. However, the real-world knowledge graphs can grow dynamically, and some new knowledge are often added. To embed the new knowledge into the space of original knowledge graph, the classic models have to perform the entire re-embedding with including the new and original knowledge. This causes heavy computational burden for embedding. To address this problem, this study proposes a new model of anchors-based incremental embedding (ABIE) to implement the dynamical embedding for the growing knowledge graph. According to ABIE, every knowledge graph has some key entities, called anchors, which can fix the embedding space of knowledge graph. When some new knowledge is added into the graph, only a few updated entities and relations are embedded into the embedding space with the help of anchors, and the entire re-embedding on the whole graph is not necessary. By this way, the computational burden of embedding caused by the growth of knowledge graph is reduced significantly.",

      "abstract": "Polypharmacy side effect prediction is a vital task in healthcare machine learning, aiming to predict the occurrence of multiple side effects when patients take drugs together. Existing researches mainly follow the deep encoder-decoder paradigm and suffer from the following two limitations: 1) The encoder simply combines inadequate information about drugs; 2) The decoder fails to capture dependencies among different side effects, thus hindering accurate prediction. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we propose a boundary-guided polypharmacy side effect prediction method (BACON). Our framework constructs two complementary views based on drug’s chemical substructure and biochemical features and enhances drug representations via contrastive learning. The decoder incorporates a boundary-guided strategy to capture drug interaction dependencies for optimizing polypharmacy side effect prediction. Experimental results demonstrate BACON superiority over SOTA models in accurately predicting drug side effect events.",

The information we can find in a scientific publication document is as follows: author, institution, name of journal/conference, and research topic. A knowledge graph that has been built is usually still not perfect. Some incomplete information may be found. To add the missing information, we can use knowledge graph completion, which is a method for finding missing or incorrect relationships to improve the quality of a knowledge graph. Knowledge graph completion can be carried out on a scholarly knowledge graph by adding new entities and relationships to produce further information in the scholarly knowledge graph. The data added to the scholarly knowledge graph are only other papers of first author entity, the research field of first author entity, and a description of the conference/journal entity. The result shows that the scholarly knowledge graph was completed by adding 81% correct data for other papers of first author entity, 80.3% correct data for the research field of first author entity, and 53.9% correct data for the description of the conference/journal.",

      "abstract": "Medical deep learning models depend heavily on domain-specific knowledge to perform well on knowledge-intensive clinical tasks. Prior work has primarily leveraged unimodal knowledge graphs, such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), to enhance model performance. However, integrating multimodal medical knowledge graphs remains largely underexplored, mainly due to the lack of resources linking imaging data with clinical concepts. To address this gap, we propose MEDMKG, a Medical Multimodal Knowledge Graph that unifies visual and textual medical information through a multi-stage construction pipeline. MEDMKG fuses the rich multimodal data from MIMIC-CXR with the structured clinical knowledge from UMLS, utilizing both rule-based tools and large language models for accurate concept extraction and relationship modeling. To ensure graph quality and compactness, we introduce Neighbor-aware Filtering (NaF), a novel filtering algorithm tailored for multimodal knowledge graphs. We evaluate MEDMKG across three tasks under two experimental settings, benchmarking twenty-four baseline methods and four state-of-the-art vision-language backbones on six datasets. Results show that MEDMKG not only improves performance in downstream medical tasks but also offers a strong foundation for developing adaptive and robust strategies for multimodal knowledge integration in medical artificial intelligence.",

      "abstract": "The graph attention network (GAT) [1] has started to become a mainstream neural network architecture since 2018, yielding remarkable performance gains in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Although GAT has reached the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance as a recent success in relation prediction in knowledge graph, the current model is still limited by the following two aspects: (1) the existing model only considers the neighbors from the inbound-direction of the given entity, but ignores the rich neighborhood information from outbound-directions; (2) the existing model only uses the $k$-th hop output to learn the multi-hop embeddings, which leads to the loss of a large amount of early-stage embedding information (e.g., one-hop) at the graph attention step. In this study, we propose a novel bidirectional graph attention network (BiGAT) to learn the hierarchical neighbor propagation. In our proposed BiGAT, an inbound-directional GAT and an outbound-directional GAT are introduced to capture sufficient neighborhood information before propagating the bidirectional neighborhood information to learn the multi-hop feature embeddings in a hierarchical manner. Experiments conducted on the four publicly available datasets show that BiGAT achieves the competitive results in comparison to other SOTA methods.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR), aiming to deduce new facts from existing facts based on mined logic rules underlying knowledge graphs (KGs), has become a fast-growing research direction. It has been proven to significantly benefit the usage of KGs in many AI applications, such as question answering, recommendation systems, and etc. According to the graph types, existing KGR models can be roughly divided into three categories, i.e., static models, temporal models, and multi-modal models. Early works in this domain mainly focus on static KGR, and recent works try to leverage the temporal and multi-modal information, which are more practical and closer to real-world. However, no survey papers and open-source repositories comprehensively summarize and discuss models in this important direction. To fill the gap, we conduct a first survey for knowledge graph reasoning tracing from static to temporal and then to multi-modal KGs. Concretely, the models are reviewed based on bi-level taxonomy, i.e., top-level (graph types) and base-level (techniques and scenarios). Besides, the performances, as well as datasets, are summarized and presented. Moreover, we point out the challenges and potential opportunities to enlighten the readers.",

      "abstract": "Logical query answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) is a fundamental yet complex task. A promising approach to achieve this is to embed queries and entities jointly into the same embedding space. Research along this line suggests that using multi-modal distribution to represent answer entities is more suitable than uni-modal distribution, as a single query may contain multiple disjoint answer subsets due to the compositional nature of multi-hop queries and the varying latent semantics of relations. However, existing methods based on multi-modal distribution roughly represent each subset without capturing its accurate cardinality, or even degenerate into uni-modal distribution learning during the reasoning process due to the lack of an effective similarity measure. To better model queries with diversified answers, we propose Query2GMM for answering logical queries over knowledge graphs. In Query2GMM, we present the GMM embedding to represent each query using a univariate Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Each subset of a query is encoded by its cardinality, semantic center and dispersion degree, allowing for precise representation of multiple subsets. Then we design specific neural networks for each operator to handle the inherent complexity that comes with multi-modal distribution while alleviating the cascading errors. Last, we design a new similarity measure to assess the relationships between an entity and a query's multi-answer subsets, enabling effective multi-modal distribution learning for reasoning. Comprehensive experimental results show that Query2GMM outperforms the best competitor by an absolute average of 6.35%.",

      "abstract": "Handling graph data is one of the most difficult tasks. Traditional techniques, such as those based on geometry and matrix factorization, rely on assumptions about the data relations that become inadequate when handling large and complex graph data. On the other hand, deep learning approaches demonstrate promising results in handling large graph data, but they often fall short of providing interpretable explanations. To equip the graph processing with both high accuracy and explainability, we introduce a novel approach that harnesses the power of a large language model (LLM), enhanced by an uncertainty-aware module to provide a confidence score on the generated answer. We experiment with our approach on two graph processing tasks: few-shot knowledge graph completion and graph classification. Our results demonstrate that through parameter efficient fine-tuning, the LLM surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms by a substantial margin across ten diverse benchmark datasets. Moreover, to address the challenge of explainability, we propose an uncertainty estimation based on perturbation, along with a calibration scheme to quantify the confidence scores of the generated answers. Our confidence measure achieves an AUC of 0.8 or higher on seven out of the ten datasets in predicting the correctness of the answer generated by LLM.",

The knowledge graph can act as the brain of a robot and provide intelligence, to support the interaction between the robot and the human beings. Although the large-scale knowledge graphs contain a large amount of information, they are still incomplete compared with real-world knowledge. Most existing methods for knowledge graph completion focus on entity representation learning. However, the importance of relation representation learning is ignored, as well as the cross-interaction between entities and relations. In this paper, we propose an encoder-decoder model which embeds the interaction between entities and relations, and adds a gate mechanism to control the attention mechanism. Experimental results show that our method achieves better link prediction performance than state-of-the-art embedding models on two benchmark datasets, WN18RR and FB15k-237.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs are incomplete by nature, with only a limited number of observed facts from the world knowledge being represented as structured relations between entities. To partly address this issue, an important task in statistical relational learning is that of link prediction or knowledge graph completion. Both linear and non-linear models have been proposed to solve the problem. Bilinear models, while expressive, are prone to overfitting and lead to quadratic growth of parameters in number of relations. Simpler models have become more standard, with certain constraints on bilinear map as relation parameters. In this work, we propose a factorized bilinear pooling model, commonly used in multi-modal learning, for better fusion of entities and relations, leading to an efficient and constraint-free model. We prove that our model is fully expressive, providing bounds on the embedding dimensionality and factorization rank. Our model naturally generalizes Tucker decomposition based TuckER model, which has been shown to generalize other models, as efficient low-rank approximation without substantially compromising the performance. Due to low-rank approximation, the model complexity can be controlled by the factorization rank, avoiding the possible cubic growth of TuckER. Empirically, we evaluate on real-world datasets, reaching on par or state-of-the-art performance. At extreme low-ranks, model preserves the performance while staying parameter efficient.",

We propose an analogy-based approach that starts from seed entities of interest in a generic KG, and keeps or prunes their neighboring entities. We evaluate our approach on Wikidata through two manually labeled datasets that contain either domain-homogeneous or -heterogeneous seed entities.

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT4, are making new waves in the field of natural language processing and artificial intelligence, due to their emergent ability and generalizability. However, LLMs are black-box models, which often fall short of capturing and accessing factual knowledge. In contrast, Knowledge Graphs (KGs), Wikipedia, and Huapu for example, are structured knowledge models that explicitly store rich factual knowledge. KGs can enhance LLMs by providing external knowledge for inference and interpretability. Meanwhile, KGs are difficult to construct and evolve by nature, which challenges the existing methods in KGs to generate new facts and represent unseen knowledge. Therefore, it is complementary to unify LLMs and KGs together and, simultaneously, leverage their advantages. In this article, we present a forward-looking roadmap for the unification of LLMs and KGs. Our roadmap consists of three general frameworks, namely: 1) KG-enhanced LLMs, which incorporate KGs during the pre-training and inference phases of LLMs, or for the purpose of enhancing understanding of the knowledge learned by LLMs; 2) LLM-augmented KGs, that leverage LLMs for different KG tasks such as embedding, completion, construction, graph-to-text generation, and question answering; and 3) Synergized LLMs + KGs, in which LLMs and KGs play equal roles and work in a mutually beneficial way to enhance both LLMs and KGs for bidirectional reasoning driven by both data and knowledge. We review and summarize existing efforts within these three frameworks in our roadmap and pinpoint their future research directions.",

To overcome this problem, this paper investigates a simplified and generic variant for GCN-based KGC model, and shows that simple changes in the architecture of the underlying architecture (with a Subtraction Operator and an Addition Operator), can compte with state-of-the-art GCN-based models. Therefore, this paper proposes a easy-to-accomplish plug-in unit, which could be loaded into any current GCN-based KGC architectures, and help them maximize the maintenance of native model's original performance while significantly reducing parameter scale.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge-aware recommendation systems have shown superior performance by connecting user item interaction graph (UIG) with knowledge graph (KG) and enriching semantic connections collected by the corresponding networks. Among the existing methods, self-supervised learning has attracted the most attention for its significant effects in extracting node self-discrimination auxiliary supervision, which can largely improve the recommending rationality. However, existing methods usually employ a single (either node or edge) perspective for representation learning, over-emphasizing the pair-wise topology structure in the graph, thus overlooking the important semantic information among neighborhood-wise connection, limiting the recommendation performance. To solve the problem, we propose Hierarchical self-supervised learning for Knowledge-aware Recommendation (HKRec). The hierarchical property of the method is shown in two perspectives. First, to better reveal the knowledge graph semantic relations, we design a Triple-Graph Masked Autoencoder (T-GMAE) to force the network to estimate the masked node features, node connections, and node degrees. Second, to better align the user-item recommendation knowledge with the common knowledge, we conduct contrastive learning in a hybrid way, i.e., both neighborhood-level and edge-level dropout are adopted in a parallel way to allow more comprehensive information distillation. We conduct an in-depth experimental evaluation on three real-world datasets, comparing our proposed HKRec with state-of-the-art baseline models to demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority. Respectively, Recall@20 and NDCG@20 improved by 2.2% to 24.95% and 3.38% to 22.32% in the Last-FM dataset, by 7.0% to 23.82% and 5.7% to 39.66% in the MIND dataset, and by 1.76% to 34.73% and 1.62% to 35.13% in the Alibaba-iFashion dataset.",

      "abstract": "The integration of heterogeneous and unstructured data in Industry 4.0, poses a significant challenge, particularly with advanced manufacturing techniques. To address this issue, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have emerged as a pivotal technology, yet their deployment often encounters the problem of incompletion due to data diversity and diverse storage formats. This study tackles the challenge of KG completion by applying and evaluating state-of-the-art KG embedding models-ComplEx, DistMult, TransE, ConvKB, and ConvE-within a football manufacturing production line context. Our analysis employs two principal metrics of Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hits@N (Hits@10, Hits@3, and Hits@1) to comprehensively assess model performance. Our findings reveal that TransE significantly outperforms its counterparts, achieving an average accuracy of 91%, closely followed by ComplEx and DistMult with accuracies of 87% and 84%, respectively. Conversely, ConvKB and ConvE exhibit lower performance levels, with accuracy values of 79% and 76%. Through rigorous statistical testing, including t-tests, meaningful differences in MRR values across the models have been observed, with TransE leading in MRR and ConvE at the lower end of the spectrum. Our research not only sheds light on the efficacy of various KG embedding models in managing tree-like structured datasets within the manufacturing domain but also offers insights into optimising KGs for improved integration and analysis of data in production lines. These contributions are valuable both from academic research in KG completion and industrial practices aiming to enhance production efficiency and data coherence in advanced manufacturing settings.",

      "abstract": "Recent years, there is a growing interest in knowledge graph embedding (KGE), which maps symbolic entities and relations into low-dimensional vector space to effectively represent structured data from the knowledge graph. In addition, the concept of temporal knowledge graph is proposed to document dynamically changing facts in the real world. Existing works attempt to incorporate temporal information into static KGE methods to accomplish temporal knowledge representations. However, existing static or temporal KGE approaches focus on the single query fact and ignore the query-relevant contextual information in the graph structure. This paper moves beyond the traditional way of scoring facts in distinct vector space and proposes a unified framework with pre-trained language models (PLM) to learn dynamic contextualized static/temporal knowledge graph embeddings, called CoS/TKGE. Given the query-specific subgraph, our model transforms it into an input sequence and uses the PLM to obtain the contextualized knowledge representations, which is flexible adaptive to the input graph contexts. We reformulate the link prediction task as a mask prediction problem to fine-tune the pre-trained language model. And the contrastive learning technique is employed to align dynamic contextual embeddings with static global embeddings. Experimental results on three widely used static and temporal KG datasets show the superiority of our model.",

      "abstract": "With the popularization of different kinds of smart terminals and the development of autonomous driving technology, more and more services based on spatio-temporal data have emerged in our lives, such as online taxi services, traffic flow prediction, and tracking virus propagation. However, the privacy concerns of spatio-temporal data greatly limit the use of them. To address this issue, differential privacy method based on spatio-temporal data has been proposed. In differential privacy, a good aggregation query can highly improve the data utility. But the mainstream aggregation query methods are based on area partitioning, which is difficult to generate trajectory with high utility for they are hard to take time and constraints into account. Motivated by this, we propose an aggregation query based on the relationships between trajectories, so it can greatly improve the data utility as compared to the existing methods. The trajectory synthesis task can be regarded as an optimization problem of finding trajectories that match the relationships between trajectories. We adopt gradient descent to find new trajectories that meet the conditions, and during the gradient descent, we can easily take the constraints into account by adding penalty terms which area partitioning based query is hard to achieve. We carry out extensive experiments to validate that the trajectories generated by our method have higher utility and the theoretic analysis shows that our method is safe and reliable.",

      "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) have been identified as a promising approach to represent the dynamics of facts along the timeline. The extrapolation of TKG is to predict unknowable facts happening in the future, holding significant practical value across diverse fields. Most extrapolation studies in TKGs focus on modeling global historical fact repeating and cyclic patterns, as well as local historical adjacent fact evolution patterns, showing promising performance in predicting future un-known facts. Yet, existing methods still face two major challenges: (1) They usually neglect the importance of historical information in KG snapshots related to the queries when encoding the local and global historical information; (2) They exhibit weak anti-noise capabilities, which hinders their performance when the inputs are contaminated with noise. To this end, we propose a novel Local-global history-aware Contrastive Learning model (LogCL) for TKG reasoning, which adopts contrastive learning to better guide the fusion of local and global historical information and enhance the ability to resist interference. Specifically, for the first challenge, LogCL proposes an entity-aware attention mechanism applied to the local and global historical facts encoder, which captures the key historical information related to queries. For the latter issue, LogCL designs a local-global query contrast module, effectively improving the robustness of the model. The experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that LogCL delivers better and more robust performance than the state-of-the-art baselines. The code of LogCL is available at https://eithub.com/WeiChen3690/LoeCL.",

      "abstract": "Given a set of candidate entities (e.g. movie titles), the ability to identify similar entities is a core capability of many recommender systems. Most often this is achieved by collaborative filtering approaches, i.e. if users co-engage with a pair of entities frequently enough, the embeddings should be similar. However, relying on co-engagement data alone can result in lower-quality embeddings for new and unpopular entities. We study this problem in the context recommender systems at Netflix. We observe that there is abundant semantic information such as genre, content maturity level, themes, etc. that complements co-engagement signals and provides interpretability in similarity models. To learn entity similarities from both data sources holistically, we propose a novel graph-based approach called SemanticGNN. SemanticGNN models entities, semantic concepts, collaborative edges, and semantic edges within a large-scale knowledge graph and conducts representation learning over it. Our key technical contributions are twofold: (1) we develop a novel relation-aware attention graph neural network (GNN) to handle the imbalanced distribution of relation types in our graph; (2) to handle web-scale graph data that has millions of nodes and billions of edges, we develop a novel distributed graph training paradigm. The proposed model is successfully deployed within Netflix and empirical experiments indicate it yields up to 35% improvement in performance on similarity judgment tasks.",

      "abstract": "Logical rule learning, a prominent category of knowledge graph (KG) reasoning methods, constitutes a critical research area aimed at learning explicit rules from observed facts to infer missing knowledge. However, like all KG reasoning methods, rule learning suffers from a critical weakness-its dependence on the I.I.D. assumption. This assumption can easily be violated due to selection bias during training or agnostic distribution shifts during testing (e.g., as in query shift scenarios), ultimately undermining model performance and reliability. To enable robust KG reasoning in wild environments, this study investigates logical rule learning in the presence of agnostic test-time distribution shifts. We formally define this challenge as out-of-distribution (OOD) KG reasoning-a previously underexplored problem, and propose the Stable Rule Learning (StableRule) framework as a solution. StableRule is an end-to-end framework that combines feature decorrelation with rule learning network, to enhance OOD generalization in KG reasoning. By leveraging feature decorrelation, StableRule mitigates the adverse effects of covariate shifts arising in OOD scenarios, improving the robustness of the rule learning network. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark KGs demonstrate the framework's superior effectiveness and stability across diverse heterogeneous environments, highlighting its practical significance for real-world applications.",

Our method proposes a lightweight KG embedding method by using bidirectional bijection relation-type modeling to enable scalability for large graphs while using self-adaptive negative sampling to optimize negative sample generating. Our method further generates the integrated views for users and items based on relation-types to explicitly model users’ preferences and items’ features, respectively. Finally, we add virtual “recommendation” relations between the integrated views of users and items to model the preferences of users on items, seamlessly integrating RS with user-item KG over a unified graph. Experimental results on multiple datasets and benchmarks show that our method can achieve a better accuracy of recommendation compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. Complexity and runtime analysis suggests that our method can gain a lower time and space complexity than most of existing methods and improve scalability.",

In this paper, we propose BoxTE, a box embedding model for TKGC, building on the static knowledge graph embedding model BoxE.

This research explores the diversified RecSys within the intricate context of knowledge graphs (KG). These KGs act as repositories of interconnected information concerning entities and items, offering a propitious avenue to amplify recommendation diversity through the incorporation of insightful contextual information. Our contributions include introducing an innovative metric, Entity Coverage, and Relation Coverage, which effectively quantifies diversity within the KG domain. Additionally, we introduce the Diversified Embedding Learning (DEL) module, meticulously designed to formulate user representations that possess an innate awareness of diversity. In tandem with this, we introduce a novel technique named Conditional Alignment and Uniformity (CAU). It adeptly encodes KG item embeddings while preserving contextual integrity. Collectively, our contributions signify a substantial stride towards augmenting the panorama of recommendation diversity within the KG-informed RecSys paradigms.",

      "abstract": "In order to capture the complex dependencies between users and items in a recommender system and to alleviate the smoothing problem caused by the aggregation of multi-layer neighborhood information, a multi-behavior recommendation model (DNCLR) based on dual neural networks and contrast learning is proposed. In this paper, the complex dependencies between behaviors are divided into feature correlation and temporal correlation. First, we set up a personalized behavior vector for users and use a graph-convolution network to learn the features of users and items under different behaviors, and we then combine the features of self-attention mechanism to learn the correlation between behaviors. The multi-behavior interaction sequence of the user is input into the recurrent neural network, and the temporal correlation between the behaviors is captured by combining the attention mechanism. The contrast learning is introduced based on the double neural network. In the graph convolution network layer, the distances between users and similar users and between users and their preference items are shortened, and the distance between users and their short-term preference is shortened in the circular neural network layer. Finally, the personalized behavior vector is integrated into the prediction layer to obtain more accurate user, behavior and item characteristics. Compared with the sub-optimal model, the HR@10 on Yelp, ML20M and Tmall real datasets are improved by 2.5%, 0.3% and 4%, respectively.

      "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graph completion (TKGC) is an extension of the traditional static knowledge graph completion (SKGC) by introducing the timestamp. The existing TKGC methods generally translate the original quadruplet to the form of the triplet by integrating the timestamp into the entity/relation, and then use SKGC methods to infer the missing item. However, such an integrating operation largely limits the expressive ability of temporal information and ignores the semantic loss problem due to the fact that entities, relations, and timestamps are located in different spaces. In this article, we propose a novel TKGC method called the quadruplet distributor network (QDN), which independently models the embeddings of entities, relations, and timestamps in their specific spaces to fully capture the semantics and builds the QD to facilitate the information aggregation and distribution among them. Furthermore, the interaction among entities, relations, and timestamps is integrated using a novel quadruplet-specific decoder, which stretches the third-order tensor to the fourth-order to satisfy the TKGC criterion. Equally important, we design a novel temporal regularization that imposes a smoothness constraint on temporal embeddings. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art TKGC methods.

      "abstract": "Using machine learning (ML) techniques to predict material properties is a crucial research topic. These properties depend on numerical data and semantic factors. Due to the limitations of small-sample datasets, existing methods typically adopt ML algorithms to regress numerical properties or transfer other pre-trained knowledge graphs (KGs) to the material. However, these methods cannot simultaneously handle semantic and numerical information. In this paper, we propose a numerical reasoning method for material KGs (NR-KG), which constructs a cross-modal KG using semantic nodes and numerical proxy nodes. It captures both types of information by projecting KG into a canonical KG and utilizes a graph neural network to predict material properties. In this process, a novel projection prediction loss is proposed to extract semantic features from numerical information. NR-KG facilitates end-to-end processing of cross-modal data, mining relationships and cross-modal information in small-sample datasets, and fully utilizes valuable experimental data to enhance material prediction. We further propose two new High-Entropy Alloys (HEA) property datasets with semantic descriptions. NR-KG outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving relative improvements of 25.9% and 16.1% on two material datasets. Besides, NR-KG surpasses SOTA methods on two public physical chemistry molecular datasets, showing improvements of 22.2% and 54.3%, highlighting its potential application and generalizability. We hope the proposed datasets, algorithms, and pre-trained models can facilitate the communities of KG and AI for materials.",

      "abstract": "Clifford algebras are a natural generalization of the real numbers, the complex numbers, and the quaternions. So far, solely Clifford algebras of the form $Cl_{p,q}$ (i.e., algebras without nilpotent base vectors) have been studied in the context of knowledge graph embeddings. We propose to consider nilpotent base vectors with a nilpotency index of two. In these spaces, denoted $Cl_{p,q,r}$, allows generalizing over approaches based on dual numbers (which cannot be modelled using $Cl_{p,q}$) and capturing patterns that emanate from the absence of higher-order interactions between real and complex parts of entity embeddings. We design two new models for the discovery of the parameters $p$, $q$, and $r$. The first model uses a greedy search to optimize $p$, $q$, and $r$. The second predicts $(p, q,r)$ based on an embedding of the input knowledge graph computed using neural networks. The results of our evaluation on seven benchmark datasets suggest that nilpotent vectors can help capture embeddings better. Our comparison against the state of the art suggests that our approach generalizes better than other approaches on all datasets w.r.t. the MRR it achieves on validation data. We also show that a greedy search suffices to discover values of $p$, $q$ and $r$ that are close to optimal.",

      "abstract": "Most algorithms for representation learning and link prediction on relational data are designed for static data. However, the data to which they are applied typically evolves over time, including online social networks or interactions between users and items in recommender systems. This is also the case for graph-structured knowledge bases -- knowledge graphs -- which contain facts that are valid only for specific points in time. In such contexts, it becomes crucial to correctly identify missing links at a precise time point, i.e. the temporal prediction link task. Recently, Lacroix et al. and Sadeghian et al. proposed a solution to the problem of link prediction for knowledge graphs under temporal constraints inspired by the canonical decomposition of 4-order tensors, where they regularise the representations of time steps by enforcing temporal smoothing, i.e. by learning similar transformation for adjacent timestamps. However, the impact of the choice of temporal regularisation terms is still poorly understood. In this work, we systematically analyse several choices of temporal smoothing regularisers using linear functions and recurrent architectures. In our experiments, we show that by carefully selecting the temporal smoothing regulariser and regularisation weight, a simple method like TNTComplEx can produce significantly more accurate results than state-of-the-art methods on three widely used temporal link prediction datasets. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of a wide range of temporal smoothing regularisers on two state-of-the-art temporal link prediction models. Our work shows that simple tensor factorisation models can produce new state-of-the-art results using newly proposed temporal regularisers, highlighting a promising avenue for future research.",

      "abstract": "Recently, Hyper-relational Knowledge Graphs (HKGs) have been proposed as an extension of traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to better represent real-world facts with additional qualifiers. As a result, researchers have attempted to adapt classical Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models for HKGs by designing extra qualifier processing modules. However, it remains unclear whether the superior performance of Hyper-relational KGE (HKGE) models arises from their base KGE model or the specially designed extension module. Hence, in this paper, we data-wise convert HKGs to KG format using three decomposition methods and then evaluate the performance of several classical KGE models on HKGs. Our results show that some KGE models achieve performance comparable to that of HKGE models. Upon further analysis, we find that the decomposition methods alter the original HKG topology and fail to fully preserve HKG information. Moreover, we observe that current HKGE models are either insufficient in capturing the graph's long-range dependency or struggle to integrate main-triple and qualifier information due to the information compression issue. To further justify our findings and offer a potential direction for future HKGE research, we propose the FormerGNN framework. This framework employs a qualifier integrator to preserve the original HKG topology, and a GNN-based graph encoder to capture the graph's long-range dependencies, followed by an improved approach for integrating main-triple and qualifier information to mitigate compression issues. Our experimental results demonstrate that FormerGNN outperforms existing HKGE models.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Protein annotation has long been a challenging task in computational biology. Gene Ontology (GO) has become one of the most popular frameworks to describe protein functions and their relationships. Prediction of a protein annotation with proper GO terms demands high-quality GO term representation learning, which aims to learn a low-dimensional dense vector representation with accompanying semantic meaning for each functional label, also known as embedding. However, existing GO term embedding methods, which mainly take into account ancestral co-occurrence information, have yet to capture the full topological information in the GO-directed acyclic graph (DAG). In this study, we propose a novel GO term representation learning method, PO2Vec, to utilize the partial order relationships to improve the GO term representations. Extensive evaluations show that PO2Vec achieves better outcomes than existing embedding methods in a variety of downstream biological tasks. Based on PO2Vec, we further developed a new protein function prediction method PO2GO, which demonstrates superior performance measured in multiple metrics and annotation specificity as well as few-shot prediction capability in the benchmarks. These results suggest that the high-quality representation of GO structure is critical for diverse biological tasks including computational protein annotation.",

      "abstract": "The distributed representation of knowledge graphs (KGs), which embeds the structured graphs into low-dimensional embedding spaces, is widely used to facilitate various applications of AI, such as information retrieval and question answering. The primary elements of KGs, the entities viewed as nodes and the relations regarded as links between entities, naturally make up the local embedding context for each other, which is called the multi-restriction property of KGs. However, this property is not fully explored by previous models, where either only part of the multi-restriction is captured, or the capability of the embedding model is limited to a fixed function without clear interpretation. To address this issue, we propose TBNN, a triple-branch neural network to learn the embeddings of KGs. In particular, the embedding of any element of a KG is determined by its multi-restriction via an interaction layer followed by parallel branched layers. Thus, the entities and relations can be treated equivalently in spite of their seeming differences in the original KG. We define the loss function of TBNN based on the confidence score of the three elements of each triple. In addition, we propose using the log-sum-exp pairwise loss to smooth the hinge loss, which results in better performance. Empirically, we evaluate our model on the tasks of link prediction and triple classification with the subsets of WordNet and Freebase. Experiment results show that our model performs better than the baselines, especially providing stable performance for relations with different mapping properties.",

      "abstract": "The binary relational knowledge base (KB, a.k.a. knowledge graph), representing real-world knowledge with binary relations and entities, has been an important research topic in artificial intelligence, while, considerable knowledge also involves beyond-binary relations. Recently, the area proposes to model n-ary relational KBs with both binary and beyond-binary relations included. However, most current models are extended from translational distance and neural network models in binary relational KBs, which suffer from weak expressiveness and high complexity, respectively. To overcome such issues, in this work, we propose a novel two-step modeling framework, GETD, generalizing the powerful tensor decomposition technique from binary relational KBs to the n-ary case. For n-ary relational KBs with single-arity relations, the GETD framework introduces Tucker decomposition and Tensor Ring decomposition for expressive and efficient modeling. Furthermore, the framework is technically extended for the representation of n-ary relational KBs with mixed-arity relations. The existing negative sampling technique is also generalized to the n-ary case for GETD. In addition, we theoretically prove that the GETD framework is fully expressive to completely represent any KBs. Empirical results on two representative datasets show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, achieving 11–26% and 4–7% improvements on Hits@10 for the single-arity and the mixed-arity cases, respectively.",

However, these works have not well considered the hierarchical structure of knowledge graph, leading to sub-optimal results. Despite the benefit of hierarchical structure, leveraging it is challenging since the structure is always partly-observed.

Based on the RE scenario, a comprehensive introduction is made for the currently popular paradigm with prompt learning, which is investigated regarding four aspects. The main contributions of this paper are as follows. Since big models are too large to be easily trained, prompt learning has become a promising research direction for RE, our work is, therefore, a systematic introduction to this paradigm for RE and compared with traditional paradigms.

      "abstract": "The current state of the knowledge graph for industrial robots is confronted with several significant challenges. One issue is the insufficient fault data of industrial robots, which results in an inadequate number of nodes and edges in the knowledge graph and a pervasive problem of data sparsity. Additionally, industrial robots encompass a wide array of diverse and complex fault types, leading to intricate correlations and interactions among different fault types. In response to these challenges, this study proposes a method called BAKGAT for complementing the knowledge graph of industrial robot faults. BAKGAT leverages the semantic understanding and feature extraction capabilities of BERT, in conjunction with the multi-hop neighbor node information aggregation proficiency of KBGAT, thereby enhancing node and relation representation and capturing complex semantic relationship information more effectively. Furthermore, BAKGAT introduces an attention attenuation mechanism to mitigate the impact of distant nodes and amplify the attention weight of neighboring nodes, thereby facilitating the more precise capture of local structural information. To validate the efficacy of the proposed method, a series of comparative experiments was performed on two benchmark datasets, WN18RR and FB15k-237, as well as the industrial robot fault dataset IRF9K. The experimental results demonstrated that BAKGAT surpasses the performance of the baseline models, highlighting its superior effectiveness in addressing sparse and heterogeneous data.",

      "abstract": "Users may demand recommendations with highly personalized requirements involving logical operations, e.g., the intersection of two requirements, where such requirements naturally form structured logical queries on knowledge graphs (KGs). To date, existing recommender systems lack the capability to tackle users' complex logical requirements. In this work, we formulate the problem of recommendation with users' logical requirements (LogicRec) and construct benchmark datasets for LogicRec. Furthermore, we propose an initial solution for LogicRec based on logical requirement retrieval and user preference retrieval, where we face two challenges. First, KGs are incomplete in nature. Therefore, there are always missing true facts, which entails that the answers to logical requirements can not be completely found in KGs. In this case, item selection based on the answers to logical queries is not applicable. We thus resort to logical query embedding (LQE) to jointly infer missing facts and retrieve items based on logical requirements. Second, answer sets are under-exploited. Existing LQE methods can only deal with query-answer pairs, where queries in our case are the intersected user preferences and logical requirements. However, the logical requirements and user preferences have different answer sets, offering us richer knowledge about the requirements and preferences by providing requirement-item and preference-item pairs. Thus, we design a multi-task knowledge-sharing mechanism to exploit these answer sets collectively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the significance of the LogicRec task and the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph representation learning approaches provide a mapping between symbolic knowledge in the form of triples in a knowledge graph (KG) and their feature vectors. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models often represent relations in a KG as geometric transformations. Most state-of-the-art (SOTA) KGE models are derived from elementary geometric transformations (EGTs), such as translation, scaling, rotation, and reflection, or their combinations. These geometric transformations enable the models to effectively preserve specific structural and relational patterns of the KG. However, the current use of EGTs by KGEs remains insufficient without considering relation-specific transformations. Although recent models attempted to address this problem by ensembling SOTA baseline models in different ways, only a single or composite version of geometric transformations are used by such baselines to represent all the relations. In this paper, we propose a framework that evaluates how well each relation fits with different geometric transformations. Based on this ranking, the model can: (1) assign the best-matching transformation to each relation, or (2) use majority voting to choose one transformation type to apply across all relations. That is, the model learns a single relation-specific EGT in low dimensional vector space through an attention mechanism. Furthermore, we use the correlation between relations and EGTs, which are learned in a low dimension, for relation embeddings in a high dimensional vector space. The effectiveness of our models is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on three benchmark KGs as well as a real-world financial KG, witnessing a performance comparable to leading models",

      "abstract": "Recently, multi-behavior recommendation has become a hot topic in the field of recommendation systems. Yet, existing methods still face challenges in effectively representing multi-behavior semantic information from the following perspectives: (i) Previous works’ heavy reliance on a unified embedding for modeling all behavior interaction graphs hindered accuratemining of fine-grained user preference semantics across multiple behaviors. (ii) Existing multi-behavior contrastive learning (CL) tasks fail to capture the dependency of user preferring to items under different behaviors, thereby constrains the model’s ability in characterizing the personalized features of users/items. (iii) The rich semantic information in the knowledge graph is not fully leveraged. To address the above challenges, we design a Contrastive Learning-based Multi-behavior Recommendation with Semantic Knowledge Enhancement (CLMRS) framework, which consists of two encoding modules with CL tasks and a joint learning module. Specifically, in the multi-behavior meta-network encoding module, we propose a novel behavior-supervised graph convolutional encoder to fully mine the user preference semantics in each behavior. Meanwhile, in the semantic knowledge enhanced encoding module, we use a knowledge graph to provide more robust embeddings for items. Finally, we integrate the user/item embeddings learned by the two encoding modules into a comprehensive semantic vector through the joint learning module, which is used for the final prediction of potential users. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets indicate that CLMRS consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art recommendation methods.

      "abstract": "Few-shot temporal knowledge graph completion (TKGC) aims to predict missing facts in temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) when each relation has a limited number of available samples. Existing few-shot TKGC models primarily face two challenges. First, entities and relations in TKGs typically exhibit dynamic characteristics, and those models often adopt static neighbor information to improve their semantic representations, so the noise in neighbor information may be amplified. Second, those models mainly focus on crisp entities and relations, yet real-world facts are often fuzzy, rendering them ineffective at capturing fuzzy semantic information. To solve these challenges, this article investigates a novel method for modeling fuzzy TKGs information in a vector space and proposes a framework for few-shot fuzzy temporal knowledge graph completion. Specifically, we devise a dynamic attention neighbor aggregator and time-aware fuzzy mapping framework. These components facilitate the integration of semantic information from neighborhood relations and generate fuzzy membership degrees to describe the fuzzy information. Additionally, we integrate an error-aware feature extractor within the meta-learning framework, effectively addressing errors during the learning process. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves outstanding results across different few-shot settings, obtaining performance gains of 4.2%, 13.6% in terms of MRR and Hits@10, respectively, on the ICEWS0515-ff dataset, and 2.9%, 10.2% on the ICEWS18-ff dataset.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding is efficient method for reasoning over known facts and inferring missing links. Existing methods are mainly triplet-based or graph-based. Triplet-based approaches learn the embedding of missing entities by a single triple only. They ignore the fact that the knowledge graph is essentially a graph structure. Graph-based methods consider graph structure information but ignore the contextual information of nodes in the knowledge graph, making them unable to discern valuable entity (relation) information. In response to the above limitations, we propose a general graph transformer framework for knowledge graph embedding (TGformer). It is the first to use a graph transformer to build knowledge embeddings with triplet-level and graph-level structural features in the static and temporal knowledge graph. Specifically, a context-level subgraph is constructed for each predicted triplet, which models the relation between triplets with the same entity. Afterward, we design a knowledge graph transformer network (KGTN) to fully explore multi-structural features in knowledge graphs, including triplet-level and graph-level, boosting the model to understand entities (relations) in different contexts. Finally, semantic matching is adopted to select the entity with the highest score. Experimental results on several public knowledge graph datasets show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance in link prediction.",

      "abstract": "\n Knowledge graphs are vital for many tasks, including recommendation systems and node search. Learning to hash knowledge graph is to infer binary-vector representations of the graph. Compared with traditional knowledge graph embedding that learns continuous-vector representations, knowledge graph hashing could significantly reduce storage and computational time due to its binary nature. Despite the potential advantage, the problem of knowledge graph hashing is challenging due to the large-scale binary decision variables. In this paper, we propose a novel discrete optimization framework for knowledge graph hashing. We treat the relations between heads and tails in the knowledge graph as element-wise rotation to learn binary codes. An alternating optimization algorithm is then proposed to produce high-quality code that captures knowledge graph information well. Furthermore, to obtain superior binary representations, we employ a dynamic range method during the alternating optimization process to adjust the approximations of the ReLU function\n \n \\([x]_{+}\\)\n \n . This ensures that valuable measures of dissimilarity are not overlooked, leading to more accurate computations. The evaluation results on five publicly-available data sets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm against several state-of-the-art baseline methods.\n",

      "abstract": "\nPurpose\nMITRE and the National Security Agency cooperatively developed and maintained a D3FEND knowledge graph (KG). It provides concepts as an entity from the cybersecurity countermeasure domain, such as dynamic, emulated and file analysis. Those entities are linked by applying relationships such as analyze, may_contains and encrypt. A fundamental challenge for collaborative designers is to encode knowledge and efficiently interrelate the cyber-domain facts generated daily. However, the designers manually update the graph contents with new or missing facts to enrich the knowledge. This paper aims to propose an automated approach to predict the missing facts using the link prediction task, leveraging embedding as representation learning.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nD3FEND is available in the resource description framework (RDF) format. In the preprocessing step, the facts in RDF format converted to subject–predicate–object triplet format contain 5,967 entities and 98 relationship types. Progressive distance-based, bilinear and convolutional embedding models are applied to learn the embeddings of entities and relations. This study presents a link prediction task to infer missing facts using learned embeddings.\n\n\nFindings\nExperimental results show that the translational model performs well on high-rank results, whereas the bilinear model is superior in capturing the latent semantics of complex relationship types. However, the convolutional model outperforms 44% of the true facts and achieves a 3% improvement in results compared to other models.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nDespite the success of embedding models to enrich D3FEND using link prediction under the supervised learning setup, it has some limitations, such as not capturing diversity and hierarchies of relations. The average node degree of D3FEND KG is 16.85, with 12% of entities having a node degree less than 2, especially there are many entities or relations with few or no observed links. This results in sparsity and data imbalance, which affect the model performance even after increasing the embedding vector size. Moreover, KG embedding models consider existing entities and relations and may not incorporate external or contextual information such as textual descriptions, temporal dynamics or domain knowledge, which can enhance the link prediction performance.\n\n\nPractical implications\nLink prediction in the D3FEND KG can benefit cybersecurity countermeasure strategies in several ways, such as it can help to identify gaps or weaknesses in the existing defensive methods and suggest possible ways to improve or augment them; it can help to compare and contrast different defensive methods and understand their trade-offs and synergies; it can help to discover novel or emerging defensive methods by inferring new relations from existing data or external sources; and it can help to generate recommendations or guidance for selecting or deploying appropriate defensive methods based on the characteristics and objectives of the system or network.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe representation learning approach helps to reduce incompleteness using a link prediction that infers possible missing facts by using the existing entities and relations of D3FEND.\n",

      "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) are crucial for modeling evolving real-world facts and are widely applied in event forecasting and risk analysis. However, current TKG reasoning models struggle to separate causal signals from noisy observations, align temporal dynamics with semantic structures, and integrate long-term and short-term knowledge effectively. To address these challenges, we propose the Temporal Causal Contrast Graph Network (TCCGN), a unified framework that disentangles causal features from noise via orthogonal decomposition and adversarial learning; applies dual-domain contrastive learning to enhance both temporal and semantic consistency; and introduces a gated fusion module for adaptive integration of static and dynamic features across time scales. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks (ICEWS14/05-15/18, YAGO, GDELT) show that TCCGN consistently outperforms prior models. On ICEWS14, it achieves 42.46% MRR and 31.63% Hits@1, surpassing RE-GCN by 1.21 points. On the high-noise GDELT dataset, it improves MRR by 1.0%. These results highlight TCCGN’s robustness and its promise for real-world temporal reasoning tasks involving fine-grained causal inference under noisy conditions.",

While this task has been intensively approached from heuristics to graph embeddings and graph neural networks (GNNs), providing explanations for similarity has received less attention. In this work we are concerned with explainable similarity search over graphs, by investigating how GNN-based methods for computing node similarities can be augmented with explanations. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of two prominent approaches towards explanations in GNNs, based on the concepts of mutual information (MI), and gradient-based explanations (GB). We discuss their suitability and empirically validate the properties of their explanations over different popular graph benchmarks. We find that unlike MI explanations, gradient-based explanations have three desirable properties. First, they are actionable: selecting inputs depending on them results in predictable changes in similarity scores. Second, they are consistent: the effect of selecting certain inputs overlaps very little with the effect of discarding them. Third, they can be pruned significantly to obtain sparse explanations that retain the effect on similarity scores.",

This paper introduces electricity knowledge graph as auxiliary information to help knowledge recommendation. To maintain the freshness and completeness of knowledge recommendation, it is necessary to improve the freshness of knowledge graph, thus we study the dynamic updating method of knowledge graph before knowledge recommendation in electricity field. First, we study the dynamic updating method of the knowledge graph in the electricity field, and then continues to study the knowledge recommendation method based on the knowledge graph that can be dynamically updated. In the automatic updating part of the knowledge graph, the missing information is supplemented according to the existing information in the knowledge graph to achieve internal updating. When the known knowledge is limited and it is difficult to further supplement by inferring the missing knowledge, the hot new knowledge is discovered according to the network new word discovery, and the domain entity is identified, the dynamic multivariate attribute labeling algorithm (DWAL) is added to the knowledge graph to update the knowledge. Considering the dynamic of knowledge recommendation, this paper introduces a time correction factor in the process of user interest modeling to dynamically reflect the changes of users' interests, which successfully reflects the dynamic changes of users' interests and ultimately improves the quality of recommendation.",

Recent Knowledge Graph (KG) based approaches have proven successful in abstract summary generation due to their ability to represent structured and interconnected knowledge with semantic context. The KG ranking algorithm responsible for selecting graph data for inclusion in the abstract still relies on traditional ranking algorithms which lack the consideration for semantic relationships between graph nodes, and are associated with high memory consumption, processing times, and increased complexity. Knowledge discovery plays a crucial role in improving the quality of summarization by uncovering hidden patterns and enhancing contextual understanding. Therefore, our study centers on introducing a novel KG ranking algorithm, aimed at a statistically significant enhancement in abstract generation by integrating knowledge discovery techniques. The suggested ranking algorithm considers the semantic and topological graph properties and interesting relationships, patterns, and features in text data using Association Rule Mining techniques to identify the most significant graph information for generating abstracts.

      "abstract": "In the process of rotating machinery fault diagnosis (RMFD), the lack of feature conditions leads to the problem of low accuracy of traditional rule-based reasoning methods FD. This paper proposed a knowledge graph (KG)-driven device FD method and applied it to RMFD. First, we proposed a multi-level KG construction method to get multi-source data based on each level and analyzed the levels that affected the system state. A single-level KG was constructed through data features, and a multilevel KG with a stereostructure was built using a multi-source data fusion model as data support for FD. Second, we proposed an approach based on multilevel KG and Bayes theory to detect the system state and located the source of faults by combining the KG reasoning based on relational paths, then used the relationships between the structures of rotating mechanical equipment for fault cause reasoning and used the KG as a knowledge base for a reason using machine learning. Finally, the proposed method was validated using a steelworks motor as an example and compared with other ways, such as rule-based FD. The results show that under the condition of missing input features, the accuracy of the proposed method reaches 91.1%, which is significantly higher than other methods and effectively solves the problem of low diagnostic accuracy.",

Inferring missing relations (links) between entities (nodes) is the task of link prediction. A recent state-of-the-art approach to link prediction, ConvE, implements a convolutional neural network to extract features from concatenated subject and relation vectors. Whilst results are impressive, the method is unintuitive and poorly understood. We propose a hypernetwork architecture that generates simplified relation-specific convolutional filters that (i) outperforms ConvE and all previous approaches across standard datasets; and (ii) can be framed as tensor factorization and thus set within a well established family of factorization models for link prediction. We thus demonstrate that convolution simply offers a convenient computational means of introducing sparsity and parameter tying to find an effective trade-off between non-linear expressiveness and the number of parameters to learn.",

      "abstract": "The task of entity alignment between knowledge graphs (KGs) aims to identify every pair of entities from two different KGs that represent the same entity. Many machine learning-based methods have been proposed for this task. However, to our best knowledge, existing methods all require manually crafted seed alignments, which are expensive to obtain. In this paper, we propose the first fully automatic alignment method named AutoAlign, which does not require any manually crafted seed alignments. Specifically, for predicate embeddings, AutoAlign constructs a predicate-proximity-graph with the help of large language models to automatically capture the similarity between predicates across two KGs. For entity embeddings, AutoAlign first computes the entity embeddings of each KG independently using TransE, and then shifts the two KGs’ entity embeddings into the same vector space by computing the similarity between entities based on their attributes. Thus, both predicate alignment and entity alignment can be done without manually crafted seed alignments. AutoAlign is not only fully automatic, but also highly effective. Experiments using real-world KGs show that AutoAlign improves the performance of entity alignment significantly compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "To address the limitations in capturing complex semantic features between entities and the incomplete acquisition of entity and relationship information by existing patent knowledge graph reasoning algorithms, we propose a reasoning method that integrates semantic and structural features for patent knowledge graphs, denoted as SS-DSA. Initially, to facilitate the model representation of patent information, a directed graph representation model based on the patent knowledge graph is designed. Subsequently, structural information within the knowledge graph is mined using inductive learning, which is combined with the learning of graph structural features. Finally, an attention mechanism is employed to integrate the scoring results, enhancing the accuracy of reasoning outcomes such as patent classification, latent inter-entity relationships, and new knowledge inference. Experimental results demonstrate that the improved algorithm achieves an up to approximately 30% increase in the MRR index compared to the ComplEx model in the public Dataset 1; in Dataset 2, the MRR and Hits@n indexes, respectively, saw maximal improvements of nearly 30% and 112% when compared with MLMLM and ComplEx models; in Dataset 3, the MRR and Hits@n indexes realized maximal enhancements of nearly 200% and 40% in comparison with the MLMLM model. This effectively proves the efficacy of the refined model in the reasoning process. Compared to recently widely applied reasoning algorithms, it offers a superior capability in addressing complex structures within the datasets and accomplishing the completion of existing patent knowledge graphs.",

      "abstract": "Despite being studied for over twenty years, Recommender Systems (RSs) still suffer from important issues that limit their applicability in real-world scenarios. Data sparsity, cold start, and explainability are some of the most impacting problems. Intuitively, these historical limitations can be mitigated by injecting prior knowledge into recommendation models. Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) approaches are suitable candidates for achieving this goal. Specifically, they aim to integrate learning (e.g., neural networks) with symbolic reasoning (e.g., logical reasoning). Generally, the integration lets a neural model interact with a logical knowledge base, enabling reasoning capabilities. In particular, NeSy approaches have been shown to deal well with poor training data, and their symbolic component could enhance model transparency. This gives insights that NeSy systems could potentially mitigate the aforementioned RSs limitations. However, the application of such systems to RSs is still in its early stages, and most of the proposed architectures do not really exploit the advantages of a NeSy approach. To this end, we conducted preliminary experiments with a Logic Tensor Network (LTN), a novel NeSy framework. We used the LTN to train a vanilla Matrix Factorization model using a First-Order Logic knowledge base as an objective. In particular, we encoded facts to enable the regularization of the latent factors using content information, obtaining promising results. In this paper, we review existing NeSy recommenders, argue about their limitations, show our preliminary results with the LTN, and propose interesting future works in this novel research area. In particular, we show how the LTN can be intuitively used to regularize models, perform cross-domain recommendation, ensemble learning, and explainable recommendation, reduce popularity bias, and easily define the loss function of a model.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a vital role in enhancing search results and recommendation systems. With the rapid increase in the size of KGs, they are becoming inaccurate and incomplete. This problem can be solved by the KG completion methods, of which graph attention network (GAT)-based methods stand out because of their superior performance. However, existing GAT-based KG completion methods often suffer from overfitting issues when dealing with heterogeneous KGs, primarily due to the unbalanced number of samples. Additionally, these methods demonstrate poor performance in predicting the tail (head) entity that shares the same relation and head (tail) entity with others. To solve these problems, we propose GATH, a novel GAT-based method designed for Heterogeneous KGs. GATH incorporates two separate attention network modules that work synergistically to predict the missing entities. We also introduce novel encoding and feature transformation approaches, enabling the robust performance of GATH in scenarios with imbalanced samples. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to evaluate GATH’s performance. Compared with the existing state-of-the-art GAT-based model on Hits@10 and MRR metrics, our model improves performance by 5.2% and 5.2% on the FB15K-237 dataset and by 4.5% and 14.6% on the WN18RR dataset, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Introducing a Knowledge Graph (KG) to facilitate a recommender system has become a tendency in recent years. Many existing methods leverage KGs to obtain side information of items to promote item representation learning for enhancing recommendation performance. However, they ignore that KGs also may contribute to better user representation learning. To solve this issue, we propose a novel algorithm, the KIGR (Knowledge-aware Interaction Graph for Recommendation), to mine user–item interactions via KGs for assisting user representation learning. Specifically, a user–item interaction is encoded by attentively summing up the relation embedding about the item in the KG. Then, an unsupervised learning method is used to group the user–item interactions into different latent types. Further, a user–item interaction graph is divided into several subgraphs, which is referred to as a Knowledge-aware Interaction Graph, making each subgraph only contain one latent type of interaction. Finally, user representation is the fusion of user interest embedding, which is learned on the knowledge-aware interaction graph, whereas item representation is learned on the KG. Experimental results on MovieLens, LastFM and Amazon-Book validate that the proposed KIGR has a superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.",

      "abstract": "Embedding entities and relations into continuous vector spaces has attracted a surge of interest in recent years. Most embedding methods assume that all test entities are available during training, which makes it time-consuming to retrain embeddings for newly emerging entities. To address this issue, recent works apply the graph neural network on the existing neighbors of the unseen entities. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely Virtual Neighbor (VN) network, to address three key challenges. Firstly, to reduce the neighbor sparsity problem, we introduce the concept of the virtual neighbors inferred by rules. And we assign soft labels to these neighbors by solving a rule-constrained problem, rather than simply regarding them as unquestionably true. Secondly, many existing methods only use one-hop or two-hop neighbors for aggregation and ignore the distant information that may be helpful. Instead, we identify both logic and symmetric path rules to capture complex patterns. Finally, instead of one-time injection of rules, we employ an iterative learning scheme between the embedding method and virtual neighbor prediction to capture the interactions within. Experimental results on two knowledge graph completion tasks demonstrate that our VN network significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, results on Subject/Object-R show that our proposed VN network is highly robust to the neighbor sparsity problem.",

      "abstract": "The increasing popularity of multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) has led to a need for efficient entity alignment techniques that can exploit multi-modal information to integrate knowledge from different sources. GNN-based multi-modal entity alignment (MMEA) methods have achieved significant progress in entity alignment(EA) areas. However, these methods only rely on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to encode structural information, while ignoring visual and semantic modalities, which may lead to incomplete representation, thus how to integrate the visual and semantic information into GNN-based EA methods remains unexplored. In light of our insight that incorporating the message-passing mechanism of Graph Neural Networks to integrate multi-modal information is essential for fully exploiting the graph representation capability of GNN, we propose a novel Cross-modal Graph attention network for Entity Alignment (XGEA) that enables visual knowledge to interact with other views of the entity, including structural and literal information. We leverage the information from one modality as complementary relation information to compute the attention of another modality in the graph attention layers, enabling the learning of entity embedding by integrating multiple modalities. Moreover, the quantity of labeled data plays a crucial role in model performance, yet obtaining sufficient training data is expensive. To mitigate this issue, we use visual and semantic information to generate pseudo-pairs and propose a soft pseudo-labeling method for entity alignment to assign weights to the augmented training data to balance its quantity and quality. Extensive experiments show that our XGEA achieves superior performance consistently over the state-of-the-art MMEA baselines.",

Here, graph neural networks were trained and optimized for two large-scale classification problems: the rigidity of a molecular network, and the connectivity percolation status, which is nontrivial to determine for systems with periodic boundaries. Models trained on lattice systems were found to achieve accuracies >95% for rigidity classification, with slightly lower scores for connectivity percolation due to the inherent class imbalance in the data. Dynamically generated off-lattice networks achieved consistently lower accuracies overall due to the correlated nature of the network geometry that was absent in the lattices. An open source tool is provided allowing usage of the highest-scoring trained models, and directions for future improved tools to surmount the challenges limiting accuracy in certain situations are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have demonstrated effectiveness in processing graph structure. Due to the diversity and complexity of real-world graph data, heterogeneous GCN have attracted significant attention. However, existing research predominantly relies on explicit connections to explore graph heterogeneity. In the case of edgeless graphs, such as information systems, the absence of direct edges poses a significant challenge for employing GCNs to analyze the latent heterogeneity within these graphs. Traditional approaches overlook the topological features of information systems, resulting in information loss. This article introduces a heterogeneous graph convolutional neural network based on shadowed deviation relationship (SDHGCN) to investigate the heterogeneity of information systems, thereby improving the generalizability of heterogeneous GCNs. First, shadow deviation relationship and attribute deviation relationship are constructed derived from shadow sets and information gain, respectively. Then, dexterously integrated with the feature matrix of the information system (the relationship between objects and attributes), a highly expressive heterogeneous graph is constructed. Second, by performing graph convolution operations on the heterogeneous graph, effective node representations can be obtained to complete node classification tasks. Finally, the effectiveness and nonrandomness of SDHGCN are validated by extensive comparison and ablation experiments.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in recommendation with large language models (LLMs) often rely on either commonsense augmentation at the item-category level or implicit intent modeling on existing knowledge graphs. However, such approaches struggle to capture grounded user intents and to handle sparsity and cold-start scenarios. In this work, we present LLM-based Intent Knowledge Graph Recommender (IKGR), a novel framework that constructs an intent-centric knowledge graph where both users and items are explicitly linked to intent nodes extracted by a tuning-free, RAG-guided LLM pipeline. By grounding intents in external knowledge sources and user profiles, IKGR canonically represents what a user seeks and what an item satisfies as first-class entities. To alleviate sparsity, we further introduce a mutual-intent connectivity densification strategy, which shortens semantic paths between users and long-tail items without requiring cross-graph fusion. Finally, a lightweight GNN layer is employed on top of the intent-enhanced graph to produce recommendation signals with low latency. Extensive experiments on public and enterprise datasets demonstrate that IKGR consistently outperforms strong baselines, particularly on cold-start and long-tail slices, while remaining efficient through a fully offline LLM pipeline.",

      "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) are receiving increased attention due to their time-dependent properties and the evolving nature of knowledge over time. TKGs typically contain complex geometric structures, such as hierarchical, ring, and chain structures, which can often be mixed together. However, embedding TKGs into Euclidean space, as is typically done with TKG completion (TKGC) models, presents a challenge when dealing with high-dimensional nonlinear data and complex geometric structures. To address this issue, we propose a novel TKGC model called multicurvature adaptive embedding (MADE). MADE models TKGs in multicurvature spaces, including flat Euclidean space (zero curvature), hyperbolic space (negative curvature), and hyperspherical space (positive curvature), to handle multiple geometric structures. We assign different weights to different curvature spaces in a data-driven manner to strengthen the ideal curvature spaces for modeling and weaken the inappropriate ones. Additionally, we introduce the quadruplet distributor (QD) to assist the information interaction in each geometric space. Ultimately, we develop an innovative temporal regularization to enhance the smoothness of timestamp embeddings by strengthening the correlation of neighboring timestamps. Experimental results show that MADE outperforms the existing state-of-the-art TKGC models.",

The quality of knowledge graphs is, however, often influenced by missing facts. To predict the missing facts, various solid transformation based models have been proposed by mapping knowledge graphs into low dimensional spaces. However, most of the existing transformation based approaches ignore that there are multiple relations between two entities, which is common in the real world. In order to address this challenge, we propose a novel approach called DualQuatE that maps entities and relations into a dual quaternion space. Specifically, entities are represented by pure quaternions and relations are modeled based on the combination of rotation and translation from head to tail entities. After that we utilize interactions of different translations and rotations to distinguish various relations between head and tail entities. Experimental results exhibit that the performance of DualQuatE is competitive compared to the existing state-of-the-art models.",

      "abstract": "Current research on tea primarily focuses on foundational studies of phenotypic characteristics, with insufficient exploration of the relationship between tea varieties and suitable populations. To address this issue, this paper proposes a link prediction model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and tensor decomposition, named GNN-FTuckER, designed to predict the “tea suitability” relationships within the tea knowledge graph. This model integrates the SE-GNN structural encoder with an improved TuckER model decoder. The SE-GNN encoder enhances the modeling capability of the global graph structure by explicitly modeling relations, entities, and triples, thereby obtaining embedding vectors through aggregation, updating, and iterative operations. The improved TuckER model enhances the capture of complex semantics between entities and relations by introducing nonlinear activation functions. To support our research, we constructed a tea dataset, TeaPle. In comparative experiments, GNN-FTuckER achieved superior performance on both public datasets (WN18RR, FB15k-237) and the TeaPle dataset. Ablation studies indicate that the model improved H@10 by 4.3% on the WN18RR dataset and by 1.5% on the FB15k-237 dataset, with a 1.3% increase in MRR. In the TeaPle dataset, H@3 improved by 4.7% and H@10 increased by 3.1%. This research provides significant insights for further exploring the potential of tea varieties and evaluating the health benefits of tea consumption.",

      "abstract": "The present study focuses on the characteristics optimization of the physical instruments with the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The hypothesis in this research work was that the characteristics of spectrometers and rheometers could affect their rankings, which in turn could be influenced by the underestimation of their cost criterion. In this paper, the characteristics optimization of the FTIR spectrometers and rheometers was carried out with TOPSIS. Moreover, its modified algorithm was also used in order to analyze the inappropriate consideration of these instruments due to category confusion. The modification of TOPSIS helped obtain an automated decision-making method for the treatment of data. The results showed that the rankings of the FTIR spectrometers and rheometers were different as expected. Moreover, the rankings of the FTIR spectrometers were different with using the unmodified and modified TOPSIS; however, that of the rheometers did not change. The change in the ranking of the FTIR spectrometers was due to the application of the fuzzy disjunction in the TOPSIS code. In this case, the first and second candidates were placed in the first and second positions, respectively, whereas the second candidate had a better rank than the first one in the analysis with the unmodified TOPSIS code. The rank improvement of the first candidate in the category of FTIR spectrometers after the modification of the TOPSIS code was also observed. The results of this work can be used in mechanical engineering and materials science as the appropriate use of instruments in these fields depends on the consideration of their characteristics for which their optimization in comparison with those of other instruments could provide interesting results. Such investigations would provide complementary data for the experimental approaches in further applications.",

      "abstract": "With the rapid growth of the internet and online education resources, the number of massive open online courses (MOOCs) has increased dramatically, making it difficult for users to find personalized courses that meet their needs. Knowledge graphs (KGs) have been employed in recommendation systems to effectively address the issue of sparse interaction data in the MOOC scenarios for their rich semantic information. Research on KG-enhanced recommendation algorithms has found that the utilization of side information in KGs is crucial for improving accuracy. This paper introduces KGCN-UP (Knowledge Graph Convolutional Networks with User Preferences), a novel model for predicting the likelihood of a user interacting with a course based on user preferences and item relationships within a knowledge graph. The KGCN-UP model consists of two key modules. First, the user preference propagation module refines user preferences by exploring relational chains in the knowledge graph and dynamically adjusting attention to improve user representation. Second, the item neighbor enhancement module enhances item representations by aggregating semantic relationships and assigning attention weights based on the type of relationship between entities. Together, these components address the challenge of data sparsity and improve the quality of recommendations by leveraging high-order structural and semantic information. Empirical results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that KGCN-UP significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art recommendation models in terms of accuracy.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT As an emerging knowledge representation model in the domain of knowledge graphs, geographic knowledge graph can take full advantage of semantic, spatial and temporal information to facilitate answering spatio-temporal questions and completing relations. However, the representation of geographic knowledge graphs still has issues such as the difficulty of unified heterogeneous spatio-temporal data modelling, weak ability to answer spatio-temporal queries for dynamic multiobjective problems, and low efficiency of graph querying. This paper presents a grid-augmented geographic knowledge graph (AugGKG) based on the GeoSOT global subdivision grid model and time slice subgraph architecture. AugGKG discretely normalizes the spatio-temporal data of the graph, which involves five types of nodes and two types of relations. By using the geo-hidden layer of the graph and geocoding algebraic operations, the AugGKG can quickly answer complex multiobjective spatio-temporal queries and complete implicit spatio-temporal relations. Compared with existing geographic knowledge graphs (YAGO, GeoKG and GEKG), the comparative experiments verified the obvious advantages of AugGKG in terms of uniformity of accuracy, completeness, and efficiency. Hence, AugGKG is expected to be regarded as an innovative and robust geographic knowledge graph that can perform fast computation and relation completion for complex spatio-temporal queries in future geospatial question answering applications.",

      "abstract": "The knowledge graph (KG) enhanced recommendation system has shown superior performance and attracted considerable attention. In recent years, researchers have attempted to apply graph neural networks (GNNs) and build end-to-end knowledge graph enhanced recommendation systems. Although several methods are proposed, it is still challenging to apply GNNs to solve the problem of KG enhanced recommendation due to the heterogeneous, redundant, and large-scale nature of KG versus the homogeneous nature of GNNs. To address the limitations of existing techniques, we propose a transformed heterogeneous graph neural network (TRANSGNN), an item-centric and GNN-powered framework that can better explore the heterogeneous, redundant, and large-scale relations among items in KG for an effective and efficient KG enhanced top- K recommendation. In particular, we propose an item-centric graph transformation module to transform the heterogeneous KG into a homogeneous item-item graph. This scheme allows us to distill the knowledge from the KG and encode the heterogeneous, redundant, and large-scale item-item relationship into a smaller, compact, homogeneous graph, better fitting the GNNs architecture that prefers homogeneous and small-scale graph input. We further introduce a collaborative graph fusion module to fuse the item-wise KG relational signals and the collaborative signals by augmenting the collaborative graph with the transformed item-item graph. Next, we propose to use a graph collaborative encoder over the augmented graph to propagate information along with high-order connectivity. The proposed framework is general and can be easily extended with advanced KG embedding and GNN models. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in significantly (up to 23%) improving the KG enhanced recommendation performance over the state-of-the-art methods, such as KGIN, KGAT, KGNN-LS in both regular and cold-start settings. The proposed approach is also efficient with significantly (up to 31%) fewer parameters.",

However, few works utilize the extra structural information to generate embeddings.

Our work uses a convolutional transition and attention-based aggregation graph neural network to solve both the OOKG entity problem and the new OOKG relation problem without retraining, regarding the structural neighbors as the auxiliary information.

      "abstract": "Insider threats have become a prominent driver behind a myriad of cybersecurity incidents in recent years. Since the threats take place within intranet, traditional security devices located at the network perimeter can hardly detect them. The trust management methods employed within the organization are likewise incapable of intercepting access actions already authenticated with valid credentials. In this paper, we propose a novel insider threat detection method named SENTINEL, which identifies abnormal behavior of insiders and provides fine-grained threat intelligence. We devise a dynamic user behavior interaction graph (BIG), which jointly considers the spatial distribution of user behavioral trajectories among the network topology and the temporal variations of user behavioral profiles. By incorporating a spatio-temporal graph neural network, SENTINEL is able to learn the operation regularities of users at specific times and respective positions in BIG. In order to perceive both the abrupt and persistent threats simultaneously, we conceive a multi-timescale fusion mechanism for detecting users' activities at different timescales. SENTINEL implements a log-entry-level detection without requiring any attack samples during model training. The experiments conducted on widely-used public datasets demonstrate that SENTINEL achieves superior performance while maintaining a relatively low computational overhead compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",

For this purpose, current models have however two limitations: they are primarily optimized for link prediction, via local contrastive learning, and they struggle to scale to the largest graphs due to GPU memory limits. To address these, we introduce SEPAL: a Scalable Embedding Propagation ALgorithm for large knowledge graphs designed to produce high-quality embeddings for downstream tasks at scale. The key idea of SEPAL is to enforce global embedding alignment by optimizing embeddings only on a small core of entities, and then propagating them to the rest of the graph via message passing. We evaluate SEPAL on 7 large-scale knowledge graphs and 46 downstream machine learning tasks. Our results show that SEPAL significantly outperforms previous methods on downstream tasks. In addition, SEPAL scales up its base embedding model, enabling fitting huge knowledge graphs on commodity hardware.",

Even though a few recent techniques tried to learn from such data by transforming a hyper-relational fact into an n-ary representation (i.e., a set of key-value pairs only without triplets), they result in suboptimal models as they are unaware of the triplet structure, which serves as the fundamental data structure in modern KGs and preserves the essential information for link prediction. Moreover, as the KG schema information has been shown to be useful for resolving link prediction tasks, it is thus essential to incorporate the corresponding hyper-relational schema in KG embeddings. Against this background, we propose sHINGE, a schema-aware hyper-relational KG embedding model, which learns from hyper-relational facts directly (without the transformation to the n-ary representation) and their corresponding hyper-relational schema in a KG. Our extensive evaluation shows the superiority of sHINGE on various link prediction tasks over KGs. In particular, compared to a sizeable collection of 21 baselines, sHINGE consistently outperforms the best-performing triple-based KG embedding method, hyper-relational KG embedding method, and schema-aware KG embedding method by 19.1%, 1.8%, and 12.9%, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs use graphs to represent multi-relational data. Graph attention networks have recently demonstrated remarkable efficacy in predicting connections within knowledge graphs. The focus of graph attention networks is restricted to the embedded information from nodes that are first-order neighbors. To obtain multi-order neighbor information, existing works usually use superimposed multi-layer graph attention networks to achieve the purpose of aggregating multi-order neighbor information. However, this methodology could lead to a homogenization of node features in the knowledge graph, thereby posing challenges to the differentiation of features among nodes. We introduce an approach that employs a multi-hop graph attention network to integrate relationships between nodes across multiple hops and entity details, viewing the combined features of nodes from different orders as temporal sequences. The gating mechanism inherent in Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks is utilized to selectively distill and refine the feature information of nodes. The effectiveness of our model is substantiated through evaluations on popular benchmark datasets, with the experimental findings revealing its superior predictive accuracy in knowledge graph link prediction compared to extant models.",

However, knowledge tends to evolve with time, and static knowledge graph completion (KGC) methods struggle to capture the changes. Therefore, temporal knowledge graph (TKG) reasoning has become a focus of research. Most existing TKG methods incorporate temporal information into triplets and transform them into KGC tasks, ignoring the important influence of time information and implicit relationships between entities. In this paper, we propose a new method called TD‐RKG, which addresses the challenges of temporal variability and implicit entity correlations based on a dynamic fusion representation learning approach. The method consists of four modules: dynamic local recurrent encoding layer, dynamic implicit encoding layer, dynamic global information attention layer and decoding layer. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in TD‐RKG across multiple evaluation metrics.",

      "abstract": "The dual-agent multi-hop reasoning method addresses the issue of target entity omission in single-agent systems caused by increased reasoning path length. However, this method still has the following challenges: First, even if the agent finds the correct answer within the knowledge graph, it may misclassify it as incorrect due to training set limitations, known as the false negative target problem. Second, agents may be misled by erroneous paths, leading to the creation of false positive paths. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a dual-agent multi-hop reasoning method based on Reward Shaping and Action Dropout (RADAM). This approach improves the model in two ways: (1) by introducing an embedding-based single-hop reasoning model, TransE, to optimize the reward function and reduce false negatives; and (2) by incorporating a random masking mechanism to diminish the agent's sensitivity to spurious paths, thereby reducing false positive paths. Experimental results demonstrate that RADAM achieves more accurate and efficient answer retrieval across most benchmark datasets compared to baseline algorithms, with ablation experiments further confirming the effectiveness and synergy of reward shaping and action dropout.",

Recently, due to the efficiency of graph neural networks (GNNs) in capturing topological structures and the effectiveness of text descriptions in supplementing semantic information, numerous models integrating graph structures and entity descriptions have emerged. However, these approaches typically focus on aggregating neighboring feature information and overlook mining hidden structural information. Furthermore, they often append textual descriptions to entities independently without considering the semantics within specific relations. Hence, we propose the SRE-KGC model to address these challenges. First, while aggregating neighbors, we analyze and mine the hidden structure in the neighborhood from the perspective of entities and relations; then we introduced a dual-layer attention mechanism to extract the most pertinent textual information towards relations from both the relational semantic level and the neighbor semantic level respectively; finally, the two learned features are fused and sent to the decoder for scoring. Experiments demonstrate that our model delivers superior performance.",

In this paper, we propose a collaboratively enhanced anonymized knowledge graph recommendation model (CE-KGR) to mine first-order similar users from historical user-item interactions, which has the advantages of low computational complexity and can flexibly migrate to the embedding-based knowledge graph recommendation models. Aiming to decouple user and entity embeddings, we use graph neural networks to explicitly aggregate similar users' information for updating user embeddings and mine similar users' potentially similar consumption preferences. We conducted extensive experiments on multiple public datasets.

To add new relations to the existing knowledge graph by using knowledge graph embedding models, we have to evaluate $N\\times N \\times R$ vector operations, where $N$ is the number of entities and $R$ is the number of relation types. It is very costly. In this paper, we provide an efficient knowledge graph completion framework on GPUs to get new relations using knowledge graph embedding vectors. In the proposed framework, we first define\"transformable to a metric space\"and then provide a method to transform the knowledge graph completion problem into the similarity join problem for a model which is\"transformable to a metric space\". After that, to efficiently process the similarity join problem, we derive formulas using the properties of a metric space. Based on the formulas, we develop a fast knowledge graph completion algorithm. Finally, we experimentally show that our framework can efficiently process the knowledge graph completion problem.",

      "abstract": "Recent research in inductive reasoning has focused on predicting missing links between entities that are not observed during training. However, most approaches usually require that the relations are known at the inference time. In the real world, new entities and new relations usually emerge concurrently, which greatly challenges the model's generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a novel inductive knowledge graph embedding model that effectively handles unknown entities and relations by capturing their local structural features. Specifically, a relation graph is constructed to learn relation representations. In the relation graph, we employ a four-dimensional vector to represent the interaction patterns between nodes (relations), where each dimension corresponds to a specific type of interaction. For entity representations, our model dynamically initializes entity features using relation features and attentively aggregates neighboring features of entities to update entity features. By modeling interaction patterns between relations and incorporating structural information of entities, our model learns how to aggregate neighboring embeddings using attention mechanisms, thus generating high-quality embeddings for new entities and relations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios involving completely new relations.",

The model employs a two-step process: (1) Triple Retrieval, where relevant triples are retrieved from the textual knowledge graph based on semantic similarities to the question, and (2) Answer Selection, where a knowledge graph embedding approach is utilized for answering the question. This involves positioning the embedding for the answer entity close to the embedding of the question entity, incorporating a vector representing the question and textual relations between entities. Extensive experiments evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, comparing KGE-FEQ to state-of-the-art baselines in FEQ answering and the most advanced open-domain question answering techniques applied to FEQs.

It also provides valuable insights into market trends and consumer preferences, allowing publishers and marketers to make data-driven decisions regarding book production and marketing strategies. While traditional book genre classification methods primarily rely on review data or textual analysis, incorporating additional modalities, such as book covers, blurbs, and metadata, can offer richer context and improve prediction accuracy. However, the presence of incomplete or noisy information across these modalities presents a significant challenge. This paper introduces IMAGINE (Intelligent Multi-modal Adaptive Genre Identification NEtwork), a framework designed to address these complexities. IMAGINE extracts robust feature representations from multiple modalities and dynamically selects the most informative sources based on data availability. It employs a hierarchical classification strategy to capture genre relationships and remains adaptable to varying input conditions. Additionally, we curate a hierarchical genre classification dataset that structures genres into a well-defined taxonomy, accommodating the diverse nature of literary works. IMAGINE integrates information from multiple sources and assigns multiple genre labels to each book, ensuring a more comprehensive classification. A key feature of our framework is its resilience to incomplete data, enabling accurate predictions even when certain modalities, such as text, images, or metadata, are missing or incomplete. Experimental results show that IMAGINE outperformed existing baselines in genre classification accuracy, particularly in scenarios with insufficient modality-specific data.",

In detail, we present a straightforward design of an experimental approach varying the dwelling temperature and the temperature ramps during the curing of stacked prepregs. In this way, we demonstrate that for cured composites comprising a poly(furfuryl alcohol)-based matrix, the porosity and connected mechanical properties achieved with autoclave-free curing processes sensitively depend on these process parameters. Applying the resulting data-based model is shown to support decision-making for sustainable composite manufacture.",

However, existing methods face three major challenges: (1) the difficulty of capturing long-distance dependencies in information sparse environments; (2) the problem of noise interference; (3) the complexity of modeling temporal relationships. These seriously impact the accuracy and robustness of reasoning. To address these challenges, we proposes a framework based on Dual-gate and Noise-aware Contrastive Learning (DNCL) to improve the performance of TKGR. The framework consists of three core modules: (1) We employ a multi-dimensional gated update module, which flexibly selects key information and suppresses redundant information through a dual-gate mechanism, thereby alleviating the long-distance dependencies problem; (2) We construct a noise-aware adversarial modeling module, which improves robustness and reduces the impact of noise through adversarial training; (3) We design a multi-layer embedding contrastive learning module, which enhances the representation ability through intra-layer and inter-layer contrastive learning strategies to better capture the latent relationships in the temporal dimension. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets show that the DNCL model is better than the current methods, especially for ICEWS14, ICEWS05-15 and ICEWS18 datasets, Hit@1 has improved by 6.91%, 4.31% and 5.30% respectively.",

To that end, we propose a novel temporal neuro-symbolic model, NeuSTIP, that performs link prediction and time interval prediction in a TKG. NeuSTIP learns temporal rules in the presence of the Allen predicates that ensure the temporal consistency between neighboring predicates in a given rule. We further design a unique scoring function that evaluates the confidence of the candidate answers while performing link prediction and time interval prediction by utilizing the learned rules.

      "abstract": "Name disambiguation aims to identify unique authors with the same name. Existing name disambiguation methods always exploit author attributes to enhance disambiguation results. However, some discriminative author attributes (e.g., email and affiliation) may change because of graduation or job-hopping, which will result in the separation of the same author's papers in digital libraries. Although these attributes may change, an author's co-authors and research topics do not change frequently with time, which means that papers within a period have similar text and relation information in the academic network. Inspired by this idea, we introduce Multi-view Attention-based Pairwise Recurrent Neural Network (MA-PairRNN) to solve the name disambiguation problem. We divided papers into small blocks based on discriminative author attributes and blocks of the same author will be merged according to pairwise classification results of MA-PairRNN. MA-PairRNN combines heterogeneous graph embedding learning and pairwise similarity learning into a framework. In addition to attribute and structure information, MA-PairRNN also exploits semantic information by meta-path and generates node representation in an inductive way, which is scalable to large graphs. Furthermore, a semantic-level attention mechanism is adopted to fuse multiple meta-path based representations. A Pseudo-Siamese network consisting of two RNNs takes two paper sequences in publication time order as input and outputs their similarity. Results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework has a significant and consistent improvement of performance on the name disambiguation task. It was also demonstrated that MA-PairRNN can perform well with a small amount of training data and have better generalization ability across different research areas.",

For ontologies in the Description Logic $\\mathcal{EL}^{++}$, several optimization-based embedding methods have been developed that explicitly generate models of an ontology. However, these methods suffer from some limitations; they do not distinguish between statements that are unprovable and provably false, and therefore they may use entailed statements as negatives. Furthermore, they do not utilize the deductive closure of an ontology to identify statements that are inferred but not asserted. We evaluated a set of embedding methods for $\\mathcal{EL}^{++}$ ontologies, incorporating several modifications that aim to make use of the ontology deductive closure. In particular, we designed novel negative losses that account both for the deductive closure and different types of negatives and formulated evaluation methods for knowledge base completion. We demonstrate that our embedding methods improve over the baseline ontology embedding in the task of knowledge base or ontology completion.",

      "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in diverse real-world applications. Traditional GNNs are designed based on homophily, which leads to poor performance under heterophily scenarios. Current solutions deal with heterophily mainly by mixing high-order neighbors or passing signed messages. However, mixing high-order neighbors destroys the original graph structure and passing signed messages utilizes an inflexible message-passing mechanism, which is prone to producing unsatisfactory effects. To overcome the above problems, we propose a novel GNN model based on relation vector translation named Variational Relation Vector Graph Neural Network (VR-GNN). VR-GNN models relation generation and graph aggregation into an end-to-end model based on Variational Auto-Encoder. The encoder utilizes the structure, feature and label to generate a proper relation vector. The decoder achieves superior node representation by incorporating the relation translation into the message-passing framework. VR-GNN can fully capture the homophily and heterophily between nodes due to the great flexibility of relation translation in modeling neighbor relationships. We conduct extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets with different homophily-heterophily properties to verify the effectiveness of our model. The experimental results show that VR-GNN gains consistent and significant improvements against state-of-the-art GNN methods under heterophily, and competitive performance under homophily.",

      "abstract": "The effective analysis of high-dimensional Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, with substantial potential for healthcare research, presents notable methodological challenges. Employing predictive modeling guided by a knowledge graph (KG), which enables efficient feature selection, can enhance both statistical efficiency and interpretability. While various methods have emerged for constructing KGs, existing techniques often lack statistical certainty concerning the presence of links between entities, especially in scenarios where the utilization of patient-level EHR data is limited due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose the first inferential framework for deriving a sparse KG with statistical guarantee based on the dynamic log-linear topic model proposed by \\cite{arora2016latent}. Within this model, the KG embeddings are estimated by performing singular value decomposition on the empirical pointwise mutual information matrix, offering a scalable solution. We then establish entrywise asymptotic normality for the KG low-rank estimator, enabling the recovery of sparse graph edges with controlled type I error. Our work uniquely addresses the under-explored domain of statistical inference about non-linear statistics under the low-rank temporal dependent models, a critical gap in existing research. We validate our approach through extensive simulation studies and then apply the method to real-world EHR data in constructing clinical KGs and generating clinical feature embeddings.",

      "abstract": "Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) reasoning involves predicting future facts by modeling the complex event relationships between historical entities in the real world. TKGs can be viewed as a sequence of knowledge graph snapshots ordered by timestamps. However, reasoning over TKGs remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing the intricate, multi-level dependencies between entities and relationships in the sequence. Existing TKG reasoning methods often overlook the impact of local fine-grained features on sequence dependencies, which are crucial for accurate prediction. In this work, we propose the Recurrent Convolutional Fact Graph Neural Network (RCF-GNN), designed to enhance the modeling of sequential dependencies in TKGs by capturing local fine-grained features between adjacent subgraphs. The model leverages a ConvGRU network in the encoder to capture both long-term and local fine-grained dependencies through convolutional sliding operations. Additionally, a one-dimensional convolution-based multi-relation aggregator is introduced to improve the extraction of structural dependencies and deep interactive features among concurrent facts.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Recently, the methodologies for analysing remote sensing images have been iteratively refined, evolving from pixel-by-pixel analytical paradigms to Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis. Nonetheless, there remains an area for advancement concerning the transparency of the interpretation process and the rational incorporation of domain knowledge. This study introduces a framework, which hinges on image segmentation and knowledge graph, leveraging a scoring mechanism and a thresholding approach to recognize target objects. It computes the scores for all segmented patches, considering attribute weights, and classifies them as target or non-target objects based on their score thresholds. To validate the proposed framework, this paper conducted an experimental evaluation using 10 GF-2 remote sensing images from Zhejiang Province. These images were partitioned into sample and test sets. The sample image segmentation outcomes were utilized to derive attribute weights and score thresholds for eight object categories. Some object datasets, such as WHU-RS19, complemented the aforementioned data. These data elements were employed to formulate decision rules for the specified object categories. Subsequently, 10 image slices were extracted from the test images, and the above eight categories within these slices were interpreted according to the established decision rules. The interpretation outcomes revealed that both recall and precision for the eight target object categories exceeded 90%. Additionally, the overall accuracy for the interpretation of all patches was notably high at 0.88, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.99. The outcomes are also compared with the outcomes using eCognition software, which is found to be superior to eCognition’s interpretation results. The analysis of these evaluation results concluded that the proposed method enables high-precision interpretation with minimal dataset requirements, while ensuring transparency in the interpretation process.",

      "abstract": "Learning knowledge graph embedding from an existing knowledge graph is very important to knowledge graph completion. For a fact $(h,r,t)$ with the head entity $h$ having a relation $r$ with the tail entity $t$, the current approaches aim to learn low dimensional representations $(\\mathbf{h},\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{t})$, each of which corresponds to the elements in $(h, r, t)$, respectively. As $(\\mathbf{h},\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{t})$ is learned from the existing facts within a knowledge graph, these representations can not be used to detect unknown facts (if the entities or relations never occur in the knowledge graph). \nThis paper proposes a new approach called TransW, aiming to go beyond the current work by composing knowledge graph embeddings using word embeddings. Given the fact that an entity or a relation contains one or more words (quite often), it is sensible to learn a mapping function from word embedding spaces to knowledge embedding spaces, which shows how entities are constructed using human words. More importantly, composing knowledge embeddings using word embeddings makes it possible to deal with the emerging new facts (either new entities or relations). Experimental results using three public datasets show the consistency and outperformance of the proposed TransW.",

Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) aims to infer new knowledge based on existing facts in KGs, playing a crucial role in applications such as public security intelligence, intelligent healthcare, and financial risk assessment. From a task-centric perspective, existing KGR approaches can be broadly classified into static single-step KGR, static multi-step KGR, dynamic KGR, multi-modal KGR, few-shot KGR, and inductive KGR. While existing surveys have covered these six types of KGR tasks, a comprehensive review that systematically summarizes all KGR tasks particularly including downstream applications and more challenging reasoning paradigms remains lacking. In contrast to previous works, this survey provides a more comprehensive perspective on the research of KGR by categorizing approaches based on primary reasoning tasks, downstream application tasks, and potential challenging reasoning tasks. Besides, we explore advanced techniques, such as large language models (LLMs), and their impact on KGR. This work aims to highlight key research trends and outline promising future directions in the field of KGR.",

      "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the successful application of knowledge graph techniques in structured data processing, while how to incorporate knowledge from visual and textual modalities into knowledge graphs has been given less attention. To better organize them, Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MKGs), comprising the structural triplets of traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) together with entity-related multimodal data (e.g., images and texts), have been introduced consecutively. However, it is still a great challenge to explore MKGs due to their inherent incompleteness. Although most existing Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion (MKGC) approaches can infer missing triplets based on available factual triplets and multimodal information, they almost ignore the modal conflicts and supervisory effect, failing to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of entities. To address these issues, we propose a novel Hierarchical Knowledge Alignment (HKA) framework for MKGC. Specifically, a macro-knowledge alignment module is proposed to capture global semantic relevance between modalities for dealing with modal conflicts in MKG. Furthermore, a micro-knowledge alignment module is also developed to reveal the local consistency information through inter- and intra-modality supervisory effects more effectively. By integrating different modal predictions, a final decision can be made. Experimental results on three benchmark MKGC tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed HKA framework.",

The assembly process planning method based on manual experience cannot effectively utilize the large amount of hidden assembly process knowledge generated during product iteration. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an effective assembly process planning method based on knowledge graph. Fristly, the entire assembly is constructed from each layer of assembly components to reduce the computational complexity of assembly process planning. Then, assembly process planning starts from the last layer of assembly components. The entire assembly process planning is obtained by concatenating the results of each layer’s assembly process planning from bottom to top. Assembly operations are determined based on the features of the base component and neighboring assembly components. If there is no corresponding assembly operation for the assembly features, the assembly operation can be inferred through representation learning. After that, arrange and combine all possible assembly solutions to form a feasible solution space. Inferring the optimal assembly process sequence through rules. Combining the optimal assembly sequence with specific assembly operations to complete assembly process planning. Finally, Macro and micro adjustments are made to the assembly process planning of different products in the same series by comparing the differences between current product and classic product.

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) are structured knowledge bases that represent information as a collection of interconnected entities and relations. Link prediction in KGs aims to infer missing or potential links between entities based on triple facts. Among different link prediction methods, knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has gained widespread popularity, with the goal of learning low-dimensional representations for KGs. However, most present KGE methods struggle to capture both local and global neighborhood information efficiently. Additionally, many hybrid methods have limitations in modeling and capturing interactions between triples. In this article, we propose an entity-relation-guided random walk (ERGRW) method for link prediction in KGs. Unlike conventional approaches that solely focus on entity-based walks, ERGRW creatively introduces relations as objects to walk as well. Inspired by distance-based methods, we design novel random walk rules based on the translation principle within triples. Thus, the ERGRW not only captures local and global neighborhood information but also discovers potential semantic relationships and interactions in the KGs. Furthermore, the encoder–decoder framework of ERGRW is able to learn comprehensive representation and improve link prediction performance. Extensive experiments conducted on four standard datasets demonstrate the superiority of ERGRW for link prediction.",

      "abstract": "\\beginabstract Social network has obtained extensive attention in recommender system. Existing social recommendation models mostly leverage social relations to capture potential interactions between users and items, thereby enhancing recommendation performance. However, these methods ignore the fine-grained bidirectional trust weight and the constraint on the relative positions of entities in social network and user-item interaction network. To this end, in this paper, we propose a social recommendation framework with Trust mining and multi-semantic reGularization (TrustGo). Specifically, we firstly construct a trust network based on the observed social network and establish a high-quality item implicit network. Then, we integrate the trust network, item implicit network, and user-item interaction network into a heterogeneous network. We introduce a meta-path based aggregation in this heterogeneous network to map the users and items into a latent space. And then, by using an ensemble method, we can obtain the final prediction ratings. Considering the users' different behaviors in social network and user-item interaction network, we define two semantic spaces, i.e., the social semantic space and user-item interactional semantic space. And a multi-semantic regularization module is designed to adjust the relative positions of entities in the two kinds of semantic spaces, respectively. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our TrustGo model is superior to other state-of-the-art recommendation models. \\endabstract",

The multi-scale spurious-negative triple detection module classifies the sampled negative triples into spurious-negative and true-negative triples.

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a powerful framework for representing and integrating complex biomedical information. However, assembling KGs from diverse sources remains a significant challenge in several aspects, including entity alignment, scalability, and the need for continuous updates to keep pace with scientific advancements. Moreover, the representative power of KGs is often limited by the scarcity of multi-modal data integration. To overcome these challenges, we propose Know2BIO, a general-purpose heterogeneous KG benchmark for the biomedical domain. Know2BIO integrates data from 30 diverse sources, capturing intricate relationships across 11 biomedical categories. It currently consists of ~219,000 nodes and ~6,200,000 edges. Know2BIO is capable of user-directed automated updating to reflect the latest knowledge in biomedical science. Furthermore, Know2BIO is accompanied by multi-modal data: node features including text descriptions, protein and compound sequences and structures, enabling the utilization of emerging natural language processing methods and multi-modal data integration strategies. We evaluate KG representation models on Know2BIO, demonstrating its effectiveness as a benchmark for KG representation learning in the biomedical field.

      "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graph embedding (TKGE) aims to learn the embedding of entities and relations in a temporal knowledge graph (TKG). Although the previous graph neural networks (GNN) based models have achieved promising results, they cannot directly capture the interactions of multi-facts at different timestamps. To address the above limitation, we propose a time-aware relational graph attention model (TARGAT), which takes the multi-facts at different timestamps as a unified graph. First, we develop a relational generator to dynamically generate a series of time-aware relational message transformation matrices, which jointly models the relations and the timestamp information into a unified way. Then, we apply the generated message transformation matrices to project the neighborhood features into different time-aware spaces and aggregate these neighborhood features to explicitly capture the interactions of multi-facts. Finally, a temporal transformer classifier is applied to learn the representation of the query quadruples and predict the missing entities. The experimental results show that our TARGAT model beats the GNN-based models by a large margin and achieves new state-of-the-art results on four popular benchmark datasets.",

      "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) embedding has received increasing attention in the academia. However, most existing methods are extensions of traditional translation models. Due to their intrinsic limitations, it is often difficult for such methods to effectively model essential characteristics of TKG, namely three basic relation patterns including symmetry/antisymmetry, inversion, and composition. In this paper, a new 3-Dimensional Rotation Temporal Embedding (3DRTE) method is proposed. Firstly, we selectively fuse temporal and relational features of fact triples by taking advantages of self-attention mechanism in processing sequential information. Then, entities are modelled as points in three-dimensional space, and the relations are interpreted as two isoclinic rotations between entities with Quaternion.

      "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising performance for knowledge graph reasoning. A recent variant of GNN called progressive relational graph neural network (PRGNN), utilizes relational rules to infer missing knowledge in relational digraphs and achieves notable results. However, during reasoning with PRGNN, two important properties are often overlooked: (1) the sequentiality of relation composition, where the order of combining different relations affects the semantics of the relational rules, and (2) the lagged entity information propagation, where the transmission speed of required information lags behind the appearance speed of new entities. Ignoring these properties leads to incorrect relational rule learning and decreased reasoning accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel knowledge graph reasoning approach, the Relational rUle eNhanced Graph Neural Network (RUN-GNN). Specifically, RUN-GNN employs a query related fusion gate unit to model the sequentiality of relation composition and utilizes a buffering update mechanism to alleviate the negative effect of lagged entity information propagation, resulting in higher-quality relational rule learning. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of RUN-GNN is superior on both transductive and inductive link prediction tasks.",

      "abstract": "Representation learning has been applied to Electronic Health Records (EHR) for medical concept embedding and the downstream predictive analytics tasks with promising results. Medical ontologies can also be integrated to guide the learning so the embedding space can better align with existing medical knowledge. Yet, properly carrying out the integration is non-trivial. Medical concepts that are similar according to a medical ontology may not be necessarily close in the embedding space learned from the EHR data, as medical ontologies organize medical concepts for their own specific objectives. Any integration methodology without considering the underlying inconsistency will result in sub-optimal medical concept embedding and, in turn, degrade the performance of the downstream tasks. In this article, we propose a novel representation learning framework called ADORE (ADaptive Ontological REpresentations) that allows the medical ontologies to adapt their structures for more robust integrating with the EHR data. ADORE first learns multiple embeddings for each category in the ontology via an attention mechanism. At the same time, it supports an adaptive integration of categorical and multi-relational ontologies in the embedding space using a category-aware graph attention network. We evaluate the performance of ADORE on a number of predictive analytics tasks using two EHR datasets. Our experimental results show that the medical concept embeddings obtained by ADORE can outperform the state-of-the-art methods for all the tasks. More importantly, it can result in clinically meaningful sub-categorization of the existing ontological categories and yield attention values that can further enhance the model interpretability.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding models represent entities as vectors in continuous spaces and their relations by geometric transformations, mainly translation, and rotation. However, multi-relational knowledge graphs contain complex sub-graph structures, for which these two families of models fail to solely preserve. The complexities of these sub-graph structures often require embedding vector spaces with additional structures and composite transformations. A typical intrinsic additional algebraic structure on these embedding vector spaces has the potential to allow models to preserve complex relational patterns, such as non-commutativity, which are intrinsically related to the vector space. In this paper, we use linear fractional transformations (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathrm {LFT_{}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) in the noncommutative Clifford Algebra of order 2, <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$Cl(\\mathbb {R}^{2,0})$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, to embed relations. <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathrm {LFT_{}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> can be understood as transformations that generalize Möbius transformations to the framework of Clifford algebras, in a non-commutative settings.

By examining the preservation of complex structures using eleven benchmark knowledge graph datasets, our models showed results which are superior or competitive to existing state-of-the-art models relative to learning relational, many-to-many structural, and hierarchical patterns. This literature does not only advance the performance of knowledge graph embeddings but also emphasizes the importance of robust mathematical foundations and particularly the potential of Clifford algebras in embedding models.",

      "abstract": "The implementation of transformational pedagogy in secondary education classrooms requires a broad multiliteracy approach. Due to limited planning time and resources, high school English Literature teachers often struggle to curate diverse, thematically aligned literature text sets. This study addresses the critical need for a tool that provides scaffolds for novice educators in selecting literature texts that are diverse -- in terms of genre, theme, subtheme, and author -- yet similar in context and pedagogical merits. We have developed a recommendation system, Teaching Text Expansion for Teacher Scaffolding (T-TExTS), that suggests high school English Literature books based on pedagogical merits, genre, and thematic relevance using a knowledge graph. We constructed a domain-specific ontology using the KNowledge Acquisition and Representation Methodology (KNARM), transformed into a knowledge graph, which was then embedded using DeepWalk, biased random walk, and a hybrid of both approaches. The system was evaluated using link prediction and recommendation performance metrics, including Area Under the Curve (AUC), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Hits@K, and normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG). DeepWalk outperformed in most ranking metrics, with the highest AUC (0.9431), whereas the hybrid model offered balanced performance. These findings demonstrate the importance of semantic, ontology-driven approaches in recommendation systems and suggest that T-TExTS can significantly ease the burden of English Literature text selection for high school educators, promoting more informed and inclusive curricular decisions.

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become an effective paradigm for managing real-world facts, which are not only complex but also dynamically evolve over time. The temporal validity of facts often serves as a strong clue in downstream link prediction tasks, which predicts a missing element in a fact. Traditional link prediction techniques on temporal KGs either consider a sequence of temporal snapshots of KGs with an ad-hoc defined time interval or expand a temporal fact over its validity period under a predefined time granularity; these approaches not only suffer from the sensitivity of the selection of time interval/granularity, but also face the computational challenges when handling facts with long (even infinite) validity. Although the recent hyper-relational KGs represent the temporal validity of a fact as qualifiers describing the fact, it is still suboptimal due to its ignorance of the infinite validity of some facts and the insufficient information encoded from the qualifiers about the temporal validity. Against this background, we propose VITA, a $\\underline{V}$ersatile t$\\underline{I}$me represen$\\underline{TA}$tion learning method for temporal hyper-relational knowledge graphs. We first propose a versatile time representation that can flexibly accommodate all four types of temporal validity of facts (i.e., since, until, period, time-invariant), and then design VITA to effectively learn the time information in both aspects of time value and timespan to boost the link prediction performance. We conduct a thorough evaluation of VITA compared to a sizable collection of baselines on real-world KG datasets. Results show that VITA outperforms the best-performing baselines in various link prediction tasks (predicting missing entities, relations, time, and other numeric literals) by up to 75.3%. Ablation studies and a case study also support our key design choices.",

This problem is also exacerbated because of the widespread existence of sparse KGs in practical applications. To alleviate this challenge, we present a novel framework, LR-GCN, that is able to automatically capture valuable long-range dependency among entities to supplement insufficient structure features and distill logical reasoning knowledge for sparse KGC. The proposed approach comprises two main components: a GNN-based predictor and a reasoning path distiller. The reasoning path distiller explores high-order graph structures such as reasoning paths and encodes them as rich-semantic edges, explicitly compositing long-range dependencies into the predictor. This step also plays an essential role in densifying KGs, effectively alleviating the sparse issue. Furthermore, the path distiller further distills logical reasoning knowledge from these mined reasoning paths into the predictor. These two components are jointly optimized using a well-designed variational EM algorithm. Extensive experiments and analyses on four sparse benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

We provide a large-scale entity linking system to establish the associations between unstructured text and structured KG.

      "abstract": "Complex Query Answering (CQA) over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) is a challenging task. Given that KGs are usually incomplete, neural models are proposed to solve CQA by performing multi-hop logical reasoning. However, most of them cannot perform well on both one-hop and multi-hop queries simultaneously. Recent work proposes a logical message passing mechanism based on the pre-trained neural link predictors. While effective on both one-hop and multi-hop queries, it ignores the difference between the constant and variable nodes in a query graph. In addition, during the node embedding update stage, this mechanism cannot dynamically measure the importance of different messages, and whether it can capture the implicit logical dependencies related to a node and received messages remains unclear. In this paper, we propose Conditional Logical Message Passing Transformer (CLMPT), which considers the difference between constants and variables in the case of using pre-trained neural link predictors and performs message passing conditionally on the node type. We empirically verified that this approach can reduce computational costs without affecting performance. Furthermore, CLMPT uses the transformer to aggregate received messages and update the corresponding node embedding. Through the self-attention mechanism, CLMPT can assign adaptive weights to elements in an input set consisting of received messages and the corresponding node and explicitly model logical dependencies between various elements. Experimental results show that CLMPT is a new state-of-the-art neural CQA model. https://github.com/qianlima-lab/CLMPT.",

To address these tasks effectively, Relational Deep Learning (RDL) encodes relational data as graphs, enabling Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to exploit relational structures for improved predictions.

Here we introduce RelGNN, a novel GNN framework specifically designed to leverage the unique structural characteristics of the graphs built from relational databases. At the core of our approach is the introduction of atomic routes, which are simple paths that enable direct single-hop interactions between the source and destination nodes. Building upon these atomic routes, RelGNN designs new composite message passing and graph attention mechanisms that reduce redundancy, highlight key signals, and enhance predictive accuracy. RelGNN is evaluated on 30 diverse real-world tasks from Relbench (Fey et al., 2024), and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the vast majority of tasks, with improvements of up to 25%.

While most scientific work has framed echo chambers as a result of epistemic imbalances between polarized communities, we argue that members of echo chambers often actively discredit outside sources to maintain coherent world views. We therefore argue that two different types of echo chambers occur in social media contexts: Epistemic echo chambers create information gaps mainly through their structure whereas ideological echo chambers systematically exclude counter-attitudinal information. Diversifying recommendations by simply widening the scope of topics and viewpoints covered to counteract the echo chamber effect may be ineffective in such contexts. To investigate the characteristics of this dual echo chamber view and to assess the depolarizing effects of diversified recommendations, we apply an agent-based modeling approach. We rely on knowledge graph embedding techniques not only to generate recommendations, but also to show how to utilize logical graph queries in embedding spaces to diversify recommendations aimed at challenging polarization in online discussions. The results of our evaluation indicate that counteracting the two different types of echo chambers requires fundamentally different diversification strategies.",

      "abstract": "The increasing availability of pre-trained deep learning models has made transfer learning a popular approach for improving the performance of target tasks. However, selecting the most suitable pre-trained model from a large pool of candidates, especially with heterogeneous architectures, remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we address the problem of model recommendation by predicting the transferability of pre-trained models to a target dataset. Specifically, we formulate this transferability prediction task as a bipartite graph learning problem, where models and datasets are represented as nodes, and the edges represent the transferability between them. This formulation allows us to leverage model and dataset metadata as node features and empirical transferability as edge weights. A customized graph attention network, termed ModelRecommend, is then employed to estimate the transferability between models and datasets, even without access to source data. By learning low-dimensional model and dataset embeddings from their metadata and predicting edges accordingly in the latent space, our method effectively captures intrinsic model and dataset interrelationships, enabling transferability prediction for unseen model-dataset pairs. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of ModelRecommend in both general image classification and segmentation tasks in autonomous driving scenarios, highlighting improvements of 15% and 12% compared to state-of-the-art methods, respectively.

      "abstract": "The digitization trend of Chinese literature is becoming more and more significant, which provides literature lovers with more convenient ways of reading and rich literary resources. However, how to quickly and accurately find the works that meet personal interests and needs among the vast amount of literary works has become an urgent problem to be solved. Therefore, this paper focuses on the construction of Chinese literature knowledge-graph and intelligent recommend-algorithms, aiming to provide personalized reading recommendation services for literature lovers. Through natural language processing and text mining technology, a large number of Chinese literary works are deeply analyzed and structured to extract the key information in the literary works. This paper designs a variety of intelligent recommendation strategies based on the constructed knowledge-graph of Chinese literature. Combined with the classical recommend-algorithm, a hybrid recommend-algorithm based on knowledge-graph is designed. By training the neural network model, the mining and prediction of the user's potential interest is realized, which further ameliorates the intelligent level of recommendation. This study not only provides personalized reading recommendation service for Chinese literature lovers, but also provides new ideas and methods for the construction of Chinese literature knowledge-graph and the research of intelligent recommend-algorithms.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the problem of predicting missing links in knowledge graphs from entity embeddings and relation embeddings. We use the WN18RR dataset as a standard benchmark for knowledge graph completion, a task that is largely dependent upon the recognition and generalization of intricate and relational data modeling and inference patterns, as well as consolidation of multiple relationship types. This paper proposes a novel model of knowledge graph embeddings, RotatE. In terms of relational data modeling and inference, RotatE has the capacity to address and generalize to a variety of relational data patterns. In RotatE, each relation defines a rotation in a complex vector space to transition from the source entity to the target entity for the knowledge graph embedding. The training process for RotatE embedding model employs self-adversarial negative sampling to improve performance. Additionally, RotatE Cosine Similarity (RoCS) ensures scores are bounded, capturing relational nuances. Experimental results show RotatE's scalability and proficiency in modeling diverse relational patterns. In knowledge graph completion tasks on the WN18RR dataset, the optimized RotatE model significantly outperforms existing models. Compared to RotatE, the optimized model improves Hits@l by 3.5% on WN18RR.",

      "abstract": "In knowledge graph embedding, aside from positive triplets (ie: facts in the knowledge graph), the negative triplets used for training also have a direct influence on the model performance. In reality, since knowledge graphs are sparse and incomplete, negative triplets often lack explicit labels, and thus they are often obtained from various sampling strategies (eg: randomly replacing an entity in a positive triplet). An ideal sampled negative triplet should be informative enough to help the model train better. However, existing methods often ignore diversity and adaptiveness in their sampling process, which harms the informativeness of negative triplets. As such, we propose a generative adversarial approach called Diversified and Adaptive Negative Sampling DANS on knowledge graphs. DANS is equipped with a two-way generator that generates more diverse negative triplets through two pathways, and an adaptive mechanism that produces more fine-grained examples by localizing the global generator for different entities and relations. On the one hand, the two-way generator increase the overall informativeness with more diverse negative examples; on the other hand, the adaptive mechanism increases the individual sample-wise informativeness with more fine-grained sampling. Finally, we evaluate the performance of DANS on three benchmark knowledge graphs to demonstrate its effectiveness through quantitative and qualitative experiments.",

      "abstract": "Entity alignment is an important task in knowledge fusion, which aims to link entities that have the same real-world identity in two knowledge graphs. However, in the process of constructing a knowledge graph, some noise may inevitably be introduced, which must affect the results of the entity alignment tasks. The triple confidence calculation can quantify the correctness of the triples to reduce the impact of the noise on entity alignment. Therefore, we designed a method to calculate the confidence of the triples and applied it to the knowledge representation learning phase of entity alignment. The method calculates the triple confidence based on the pairing rates of the three angles between the entities and relations. Specifically, the method uses the pairing rates of the three angles as features, which are then fed into a feedforward neural network for training to obtain the triple confidence. Moreover, we introduced the triple confidence into the knowledge representation learning methods to improve their performance in entity alignment. For the graph neural network-based method GCN, we considered entity confidence when calculating the adjacency matrix, and for the translation-based method TransE, we proposed a strategy to dynamically adjust the margin value in the loss function based on confidence. These two methods were then applied to the entity alignment, and the experimental results demonstrate that compared with the knowledge representation learning methods without integrating confidence, the confidence-based knowledge representation learning methods achieved excellent performance in the entity alignment task.",

To predict instances for novel relations with limited training examples, few-shot relation learning approaches have emerged, utilizing techniques such as meta-learning. However, the assumption is that novel relations in meta-testing and base relations in meta-training are independently and identically distributed, which may not hold in practice. To address the limitation, we propose RelAdapter, a context-aware adapter for few-shot relation learning in KGs designed to enhance the adaptation process in meta-learning. First, RelAdapter is equipped with a lightweight adapter module that facilitates relation-specific, tunable adaptation of meta-knowledge in a parameter-efficient manner. Second, RelAdapter is enriched with contextual information about the target relation, enabling enhanced adaptation to each distinct relation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark KGs validate the superiority of RelAdapter over state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enable applications in various domains such as semantic search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. KGs are often incomplete, missing entities and relations, an issue addressed by Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods that predict missing elements. Different evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank (MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC models. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing their performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform others on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to determine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset, different metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where one model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further complicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder holistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that integrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more reliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we propose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust and interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized score ($M_i \\in [0,1]$). Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated aspects of performance, EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.",

To model the embedding space from a more rigorous and theoretical perspective, we propose a novel general group theory-based embedding framework for rotation-based models, in which both entities and relations are embedded as group elements. Furthermore, in order to explore more available KGE models, we utilize a more generic group structure, module, a generalization notion of vector space. Specifically, under our framework, we introduce a more generic embedding method, ModulE, which projects entities to a module. Following the method of ModulE, we build three instantiating models: ModulE$_{\\mathbb{R},\\mathbb{C}}$, ModulE$_{\\mathbb{R},\\mathbb{H}}$ and ModulE$_{\\mathbb{H},\\mathbb{H}}$, by adopting different module structures. Experimental results show that ModulE$_{\\mathbb{H},\\mathbb{H}}$ which embeds entities to a module over non-commutative ring, achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets.",

As a result, we collect over 1000 experimental data entries with information about peptide sequence, experimental conditions, and corresponding self-assembly phases. Using the data, machine learning models are developed, demonstrating excellent accuracy (>80%) in assembly phase classification.

It is very useful in many applications, such as natural language question answering, personalized recommendation and text summarization. However, the previous relation linking algorithms usually produce a single relation for the input phrase and pay little attention to the more general and challenging problem, i.e., combinational relation linking that extracts a subgraph pattern to match the compound phrase (e.g. father-in-law). In this paper, we focus on the task of combinational relation linking over knowledge graphs. To resolve the problem, we define several elementary meta patterns which can be used to build any combinational relation. Then we design a systematic method based on the data-driven relation assembly technique, which is performed under the guidance of meta patterns. To enhance the system’s understanding ability, we introduce external knowledge during the linking process. Finally, extensive experiments over the real knowledge graph confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

We divide these biomedical papers into three groups and four categories from clinical citation level and translational science perspectives. We compare the temporal characteristics of biomedical papers of different groups or categories. From the perspective of clinical citation level, the results show that highly clinically cited papers had obvious advantages of receiving clinical citations over medium and lowly clinically cited papers in both the initial and build-up stages. Meanwhile, as the number of clinical citations increased in the build-up stage, the difference in the length of time to receive the corresponding number of clinical citations among the three groups of biomedical papers significantly increased. From the perspective of translational science, the results reveal that biomedical papers closer to clinical science more easily receive clinical citations than papers closer to basic science in both the initial and build-up stages. Moreover, we found that highly clinically cited papers had the desperate advantage of receiving clinical citations over even the clinical guidelines or clinical trials. The robustness analysis of the two aspects demonstrates the reliability of our results.",

      "abstract": "Newly arriving nodes in dynamics networks would gradually make the node embedding space drifted and the retraining of node embedding and downstream models indispensable. An exact threshold size of these new nodes, below which the node embedding space will be predicatively maintained, however, is rarely considered in either theory or experiment. From the view of matrix perturbation theory, a threshold of the maximum number of new nodes that keep the node embedding space approximately equivalent is analytically provided and empirically validated. It is therefore theoretically guaranteed that as the size of newly arriving nodes is below this threshold, embeddings of these new nodes can be quickly derived from embeddings of original nodes. A generation framework, Space-Invariant Projection (SIP), is accordingly proposed to enables arbitrary static MF-based embedding schemes to embed new nodes in dynamics networks fast. The time complexity of SIP is linear with the network size. By combining SIP with four state-of-the-art MF-based schemes, we show that SIP exhibits not only wide adaptability but also strong empirical performance in terms of efficiency and efficacy on the node classification task in three real datasets.",

      "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) extrapolation aims to predict future unknown events (facts) based on historical information, and has attracted considerable attention due to its great practical significance. Accurate representations (embeddings) of entities and relations form the basis of TKG extrapolation. Recent work has been devoted to improving the rationality of entity representations. However, on the one hand, ignoring relation modeling results in incomplete relation representations; therefore, some approaches aggregate only immediately adjacent entities of relations, but this can lead to the \"message islands\" problem of relation modeling. On the other hand, ignoring the association constraints between relations and entities can make the embeddings of both relations and entities prone to overfitting. To address the abovementioned challenges, we propose an advanced method, namely, RETIA. For the former issue, we generate twin hyperrelation subgraphs for each historical subgraph and then aggregate both the adjacent entities and relations in the hyperrelation subgraphs through a graph convolutional network (GCN). About the latter concern, we propose a twin-interact module (TIM), which provides communication channels for relation aggregation and entity aggregation during the evolution of the historical sequence. Experiments conducted on five public datasets show that RETIA has made great improvements across several evaluation metrics. Our released code is available at https://github.com/CGCL-codes/RETIA.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) embedding aims at embedding entities and relations in a KG into a low dimensional latent representation space. Existing KG embedding approaches model entities and relations in a KG by utilizing real-valued , complex-valued, or hypercomplex-valued (Quaternion or Octonion) representations, all of which are subsumed into a geometric algebra. In this work, we introduce a novel geometric algebra-based KG embedding framework, GeomE, which utilizes multivector representations and the geometric product to model entities and relations. Our framework subsumes several state-of-the-art KG embedding approaches and is advantageous with its ability of modeling various key relation patterns, including (anti-)symmetry, inversion and composition, rich expressiveness with higher degree of freedom as well as good generalization capacity. Experimental results on multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art models for link prediction.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the use of recommender systems has become popular on the web. To improve recommendation performance, usage, and scalability, the research has evolved by producing several generations of recommender systems. There is much literature about it, although most proposals focus on traditional methods’ theories and applications. Recently, knowledge graph-based recommendations have attracted attention in academia and the industry because they can alleviate information sparsity and performance problems. We found only two studies that analyze the recommendation system’s role over graphs, but they focus on specific recommendation methods. This survey attempts to cover a broader analysis from a set of selected papers. In summary, the contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) we explore traditional and more recent developments of filtering methods for a recommender system, (2) we identify and analyze proposals related to knowledge graph-based recommender systems, (3) we present the most relevant contributions using an application domain, and (4) we outline future directions of research in the domain of recommender systems. As the main survey result, we found that the use of knowledge graphs for recommendations is an efficient way to leverage and connect a user’s and an item’s knowledge, thus providing more precise results for users.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding is a method to predict missing links in knowledge graphs by learning the interactions between embedded entities and relations in a continuous low-dimensional space. Current research on convolution-based models tends to provide sufficient interactions for extracting potential knowledge. However, sufficient interactions do not mean that they are reasonable. Our studies find that reasonable interactions can further stimulate knowledge extraction capability. Reasonable interactions need to ensure that the elements participating in interactions are disordered and in a reasonable number. To model reasonable interactions that cannot be specifically quantified, we propose a concise and effective model IntME to address this challenge. In detail, we utilize checked feature reshaping and disordered matrix multiplication to form two different types of feature maps to ensure the disorder of the interacting elements and control the number of elements before feature fusion by the shapes of the feature maps after channel scaling reshaping. In feature fusion, we employ large convolution filters and pointwise filters for the deep and shallow linear fusion of feature interactions, which can take into account both explicit and implicit knowledge extraction capability. The evaluations of four benchmark datasets show that IntME has a powerful performance in convolution-based models and a lower training cost, and also demonstrate that our proposed approaches based on reasonable interactions can effectively improve knowledge discovery capability.",

Considering that traditional negative sampling methods fail to generate high-quality negative samples, which in turn affects the accuracy of the network security knowledge graph reasoning model, based on Knowledge graph embedding by translating on hyperplanes (TransH), we propose an improved negative sampling TransH model (INS-TransH). This model constrains the negative samples based on the syntactic rules between entities and relations, thereby further enhancing the quality of generated negative samples. It also applies a self-adversarial negative sampling method that calculates the scores of negative samples to filter out low-quality samples. We construct a network security knowledge graph using Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CWE) database, Common Weakness Enumeration (CVE) database, and Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC) database, and use this knowledge graph as the dataset for the INS-TransH model. Experimental results demonstrate that the INS-TransH model exhibits improved knowledge reasoning capability, with enhancements in Hits at 10 (Hits@10) and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) metrics.",

      "abstract": "Insurance companies have focused on medicare fraud detection to reduce financial losses and reputational harm because medicare fraud causes tens of billions of dollars in damage annually. This study demonstrates that medicare fraud detection can be significantly enhanced by introducing graph analysis with considering the relationships among medical providers, beneficiaries, and physicians. We use open-source tabular datasets containing beneficiary information, inpatient claims, outpatient claims, and indications about potential fraudulent providers. We then aggregated them into a single dataset by converting them into a graph structure. Furthermore, we developed medicare fraud detection models using two approaches to reflect graph information, i.e., graph neural network (GNN) models and traditional machine learning models using graph centrality measures. Therefore, the machine learning model with graph centrality features showed improved precision of 4 percent point (%p), recall of 24 %p, and F1-score of 14 %p compared to the best GNN model. The improvement in recall to this extent could result in substantial cost savings of 3.1 billion euros and 5 billion dollars in the United States and Europe, respectively, benefiting governmental institutions and insurance companies involved in healthcare insurance operations. Furthermore, the required learning time of the best GNN model was approximately 250–300 times more than that of the best machine-learning model. This outcome suggests that successful and efficient detection of medicare fraud can be achieved if graph centrality measures are used to capture the relationships among medical providers, physicians, and beneficiaries.",

Recently, knowledge graph embedding (KGE) methods have gained popularity for embedding entities and relations, proving effective in KGC. However, privacy concerns make it challenging to collect privacy KG data from different institutions in the actual application. Federated learning has emerged as a solution for training models with decentralized data, eliminating the need for collecting private data. However, existing federated KGE methods overlook the implicit graph structural information of entities and relations, resulting in fragmented and incomplete representations within federated clients. Moreover, these methods often struggle with capturing multiple relational representations. To address these challenges, we propose a Federated Graph to Embedding (FedGE) approach based on encoder-decoder to capture interactions among entities and relations. Extensive experiments on two common KG datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/s460305450/FedGE.git.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs have been widely used in various domains such as intelligent question answering, information retrieval, transportation, medicine, e-commerce, and others, and have achieved significant success. To support these applications with a high-quality vector representation, numerous studies have proposed various knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models. However, most of these models primarily focus on the design of new scoring functions, disregarding the crucial role of the loss function during the model training stage. In light of this, we propose a new exponential weight coefficient loss function, named EwLoss, which can be incorporated into any typical KGE model. This loss function enables the model to better distinguish between triplets that are otherwise difficult to differentiate. Consequently, the model can learn the features of these challenging triplets more effectively, leading to improved embedding vectors. By conducting experiments on four commonly used data sets, where EwLoss is applied to six representative models, we demonstrate the superiority of EwLoss in distinguishing such hard-to-distinguish triplets. Moreover, we observe that the performance of the embedding models is significantly enhanced when utilizing EwLoss.",

By leveraging the rich semantic relationships embedded in knowledge graphs, this method achieves data association and completion between different data sources through relationship reasoning and entity mapping. Firstly, a feature selection method based on graph reasoning is proposed. Entity and relationship embedding vectors obtained through knowledge graph representation learning can predict other attributes highly correlated with the target attribute. Using these as input features for the regression model can significantly improve prediction performance and greatly reduce the cost of manual feature selection. Secondly, a systematic data grafting methodology is designed, including key steps such as knowledge graph construction, entity embedding and relationship learning, data source entity mapping, relationship prediction and data source evaluation, and data grafting strategy formulation. This provides a complete technical framework for data grafting tasks with strong systematicness and operability. Finally, extensive experiments and analyses are conducted on the China City Statistical Yearbook data. By randomly masking part of the data to simulate missing values, the proposed data grafting method is used for data repair. The effectiveness of the method is systematically evaluated by comparing the repaired data with the true values. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can significantly improve data quality.",

Although fake news detection has captivated great research effort, most of the existing works either overlook the complementary ground knowledge, formulated in individual knowledge graphs (KGs) or ignore multiple aspects of knowledge in different knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework for investigating the complementary knowledge in different knowledge graphs, which achieves superior fake news detection performance. We first model three components within news articles (i.e., news content, entities, and topics) as a heterogeneous graph (HG). Subsequently, we leverage the valuable factual evidence among real-world entities, which is enclosed in two open-source knowledge graphs (Wikidata and DBpedia), and augment the heterogeneous graph into three augmented graphs. We then fuse knowledge-enhanced high-level news representations from each augmented graph and extract a unified news representation through our proposed contrastive multi-knowledge graph learning framework, which is ultimately utilized to identify fake news. We conduct extensive experiments on four public fake news datasets and demonstrate the superiority of our method over nine state-of-the-art baselines regarding five widely-used evaluation metrics (i.e., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC).",

      "abstract": "In knowledge graph embedding, multidimensional representations of entities and relations are learned in vector space. Although distance-based graph embedding methods have shown promise in link prediction, they neglect context information among the triplet components, i.e., the head_entity, relation, and tail_entity, limiting their ability to describe multivariate relation patterns and mapping properties. Such context information denotes the entity structural association inside the same triplet and implies the correlation between entities that are not directly connected. In this work, we propose a novel knowledge graph embedding model that explicitly considers context information in graph embedding via triplet component interactions (TCIE). To build connections between components and incorporate contextual information, entities and relations are represented as vectors comprised of two specialized parts, enabling comprehensive interaction. By simultaneously interacting with one-hop related head and tail entities, TCIE strengthens the connections between distant entities and enables contextual information to be transmitted across the knowledge graph. Mathematical proofs and experiments are performed to analyse the modelling ability of TCIE in knowledge graph embedding. TCIE shows a strong capacity for modelling four relation patterns (i.e., symmetry, antisymmetry, inverse, and composition) and four mapping properties (i.e., one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many). The experimental evaluation of ogbl-wikikg2, ogbl-biokg, FB15k, and FB15k-237 shows that TCIE achieves state-of-the-art results in link prediction.",

To address this limitation, we introduce TAR-TKG (Temporal-Aware Representation for Temporal Knowledge Graph), a novel framework that consists of three core modules. The first module, the Temporal Dynamics Steering Module, enhances dynamic temporal features by employing a multi-time-awareness network to capture changes between time stamps, thereby improving the understanding of temporal data evolution. The second module, the Cross-Time Domain Gating Module, applies cross-time domain graph convolution and adaptive gating to learn relationships between different time stamps, facilitating the integration of information across multiple time spans to improve the accuracy of temporal reasoning. The third module, the Temporal Adaptive Relation Perception Module, combines temporal embeddings, causal reasoning, and multi-modal relation fusion to enhance the model’s ability to perceive temporal relationships, particularly in managing causal dependencies and complex time-based interactions. Experimental results demonstrate that TAR-TKG outperforms existing baseline methods on three real-world datasets, proving its effectiveness in capturing dynamic relationship evolution and improving temporal reasoning within TKGs.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) with real-world facts are vital for various downstream applications. However, the incomplete nature of KGs has brought lots of problems to them, and probing missing facts via reasoning or forecasting has become a promising solution. Different from the traditional KG reasoning focusing on static facts, temporal knowledge graph (TKG) forecasting incorporating time information presents more potential in event prediction, as many facts are dynamic in real-world. Despite the significance of TKG forecasting, the following inevitable problems bring great challenges for it. (1) How to alleviate the problem of temporal fact redundancy in the TKG? (2) How to merge the useful fragmented temporal facts for the given query throughout the TKG? To overcome these problems effectively, we propose a novel model entitled TKGF-NTP, which consists of two components. (1) A structural encoder is developed to aggregate the most valuable structural information and filter out the redundant temporal facts from each TKG snapshot. (2) A temporal encoder is designed to capture the evolutions of entities, while the self-attention mechanism is employed to capture the most crucial temporal information throughout the TKG. The effectiveness of TKGF-NTP is evaluated on four public datasets via link prediction, and the results demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "title": "Zero-Shot Relational Learning for Multimodal Knowledge Graphs",
      "abstract": "Relational learning is an essential task in the domain of knowledge representation, particularly in knowledge graph completion (KGC). While relational learning in traditional single-modal settings has been extensively studied, exploring it within a multimodal KGC context presents distinct challenges and opportunities. One of the major challenges is inference on newly discovered relations without any associated training data. This zero-shot relational learning scenario poses unique requirements for multimodal KGC, i.e., utilizing multimodality to facilitate relational learning. However, existing works fail to support the leverage of multimodal information and leave the problem unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, consisting of three components, i.e., multimodal learner, structure consolidator, and relation embedding generator, to integrate diverse multimodal information and knowledge graph structures to facilitate the zero-shot relational learning. Evaluation results on three multimodal knowledge graphs demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method.",

      "abstract": "In this work, we move beyond the traditional complex-valued representations, introducing more expressive hypercomplex representations to model entities and relations for knowledge graph embeddings. More specifically, quaternion embeddings, hypercomplex-valued embeddings with three imaginary components, are utilized to represent entities. Relations are modelled as rotations in the quaternion space. The advantages of the proposed approach are: (1) Latent inter-dependencies (between all components) are aptly captured with Hamilton product, encouraging a more compact interaction between entities and relations; (2) Quaternions enable expressive rotation in four-dimensional space and have more degree of freedom than rotation in complex plane; (3) The proposed framework is a generalization of ComplEx on hypercomplex space while offering better geometrical interpretations, concurrently satisfying the key desiderata of relational representation learning (i.e., modeling symmetry, anti-symmetry and inversion). Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four well-established knowledge graph completion benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "Bilinear based models are powerful and widely used approaches for Knowledge Graphs Completion (KGC). Although bilinear based models have achieved significant advances, these studies mainly concentrate on posterior properties (based on evidence, e.g. symmetry pattern) while neglecting the prior properties. In this paper, we find a prior property named\"the law of identity\"that cannot be captured by bilinear based models, which hinders them from comprehensively modeling the characteristics of KGs. To address this issue, we introduce a solution called Unit Ball Bilinear Model (UniBi). This model not only achieves theoretical superiority but also offers enhanced interpretability and performance by minimizing ineffective learning through minimal constraints. Experiments demonstrate that UniBi models the prior property and verify its interpretability and performance.",

      "abstract": "Motivated by interpretability and reliability, we investigate how neural networks represent knowledge during graph learning, We find hints of universality, where equivalent representations are learned across a range of model sizes (from $10^2$ to $10^9$ parameters) and contexts (MLP toy models, LLM in-context learning and LLM training). We show that these attractor representations optimize generalization to unseen examples by exploiting properties of knowledge graph relations (e.g. symmetry and meta-transitivity). We find experimental support for such universality by showing that LLMs and simpler neural networks can be stitched, i.e., by stitching the first part of one model to the last part of another, mediated only by an affine or almost affine transformation. We hypothesize that this dynamic toward simplicity and generalization is driven by\"intelligence from starvation\": where overfitting is minimized by pressure to minimize the use of resources that are either scarce or competed for against other tasks.",

      "title": "A Meta-Learning-Based Joint Two-View Framework for Inductive Knowledge Graph Completion",
      "abstract": "Inductive knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims at predicting triples involving new entities or relations not present during training. Recently proposed methods have achieved good performance in predicting triples involving only unseen entities, which either utilize the enclosing subgraph reasoning or learn transferable structural patterns by sampling local subgraphs. However, existing methods predominantly focus on modeling entities based on neighboring relations within independent subgraphs, posing challenges in handling sparse knowledge graphs and leading to the loss of global semantic information. In this paper, we introduce MeJo, a meta-learning-based joint two-view framework. MeJo incorporates the ontology view to provide rich, transferable type information for entity representation. The two-view interaction connects each independent subgraph, enabling the model to learn global contextual information. The model is trained to capture transferable structure knowledge from the instance view and comprehensive semantic information from the ontology view, incorporating hierarchy-aware encoding for ontologies with hierarchical structures. Furthermore, our approach can extend to handling both unseen entities and unseen relations simultaneously during the test. Extensive experimental analysis reveals that MeJo excels beyond current state-of-the-art approaches in both effectiveness and generalizability across prevalent benchmark datasets.",
